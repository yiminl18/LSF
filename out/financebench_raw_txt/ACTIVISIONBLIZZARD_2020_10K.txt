Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute
content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (“PC”s), and mobile devices. We also operate esports leagues and offer digital
advertising within some of our content. The terms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision
Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. For a discussion of the history of the formation of our Company, including our year and form of incorporation, refer to
Part I, Item 1 “Business” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our Strategy and Vision
Our objective is to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment by continuing to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing,
and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and services, as well as related media, that deliver engaging entertainment experiences on
a year-round basis. In pursuit of this objective, we focus on three strategic pillars: expanding audience reach; deepening consumer engagement; and
increasing player investment.
Expanding audience reach. Building on our strong established franchises and creating new franchises through compelling new content is at the core
of our business. We endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible by offering our content on multiple platforms and delivering compelling experiences
across multiple business models (e.g. premium, free-to-play, subscription-based, etc.).
Driving deep consumer engagement. Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement
with our franchises. We design our games, as well as related media, to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers engaged for a long period of time
following a game’s release. In addition, our games are designed to provide players the ability to connect with each other socially within our franchise
communities, thus delivering more value to our players and providing additional growth opportunities for our franchises.
Increasing player investment. Increasingly, our consumers are connected to our games online through consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. This allows
us to offer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to our consumers on a year-round basis. In addition to purchasing full games or
subscriptions, players can invest in our franchises by purchasing incremental in-game content (i.e. larger downloadable content or smaller content via
microtransactions). These digital revenue streams tend to be more recurring and have relatively higher profit margins. Further, if executed properly,
additional player investment can increase engagement, as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players. In addition, we generate
revenue through offering advertising within certain of our franchises, and we believe there are opportunities to grow new forms of player investment
through esports and consumer products. We are still in the early stages of developing these new revenue streams.
Our Segments
Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments, each of which is a leading global developer and
publisher of interactive entertainment content and services based primarily on our internally developed intellectual properties.
(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.
Activision Publishing, Inc. (“Activision”) delivers content through both premium and free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from
full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision’s key
product franchise is Call of Duty, a first-person action franchise. Activision also includes the activities of the Call of Duty League, a global professional
esports league with city-based teams.® TM

Table of Contents
(ii) Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.
Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (“Blizzard”) delivers content through both premium and free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from full-
game and in-game sales, subscriptions, and by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also
maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision
content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. Blizzard’s key product franchises include: World of Warcraft, a
subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing franchise; Hearthstone, an online collectible card franchise based in the Warcraft universe;
Diablo, an action role-playing franchise; and Overwatch, a team-based first-person action franchise. Blizzard also includes the activities of the
Overwatch League, a global professional esports league with city-based teams.
(iii) King Digital Entertainment
King Digital Entertainment (“King”) delivers content primarily through free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from in-game sales
and in-game advertising on the mobile platform. King’s key product franchise is Candy Crush™, a “match three” franchise.
Other
We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including the Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”)
business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
Impacts of the Global COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) emerged and has since extensively impacted global health and the economic
environment. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In an effort to contain the spread of
COVID-19, domestic and international governments around the world enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed
“essential,” quarantine orders for individuals to stay in their homes or places of residence, and to practice social distancing when engaging in essential
activities. We anticipate that these actions and the ongoing global health crisis caused by COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact many business
activities and financial markets across the globe.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our business has experienced an increase in demand for certain of our products and services as a result of the stay-
at-home orders enacted in various regions as players have more time to engage with our games. These trends contributed to strong full-game and in-game
content sales for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare which also benefited from the launch of Call of Duty: Warzone in March. In addition, we saw further
demand for World of Warcraft, including its in-game content, which also continued to benefit from the release of World of Warcraft Classic in August 2019.
Beginning in the month of March, our business also experienced an increase in monthly active users for certain franchises. We have, however, seen a
moderation in these trends since the stay-at-home orders were originally enacted earlier in 2020.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders enacted in various regions, both the Overwatch League and the Call of Duty League
pivoted all matches from their originally planned local homestand formats to online play and remote production for the remainder of the regular and
postseason in order to keep players and fans safe while still delivering premium esports content to a global audience. Additionally, to support our
Overwatch League and Call of Duty League team owners and ecosystems amid a challenging environment, which includes losing the ability to have live
fan-attended home venue events, we have taken certain actions to support their short-term cash flow needs, adjusted our league operations to reduce
operating costs and improve franchise terms, and made certain investments which have impacted our operating results in 2020. This impact was primarily
in the Blizzard segment.
The sustainability of these trends and long-term implications to our business is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. See Item 1A
“Risk Factors” for additional details on risks and uncertainties regarding the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business, reputation,
financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price.®

In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, the majority of our workforce is currently working from home and we have placed
restrictions on non-essential business travel. We have implemented business continuity plans and have increased support and resources to enable our
employees to work remotely and, thus far, our business has been able to operate with minimal disruption to our game titles’ published release dates. The
COVID-19 pandemic remains a rapidly evolving situation. We will continue to actively monitor the developments of the COVID-19 pandemic and may
take further actions that could alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local, or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the
best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and shareholders. It is not clear what effects any such potential actions may have on our business,
including the effects on our employees, players and consumers, customers, partners, game development and content pipelines, or on our reputation,
financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, or stock price.
The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue,
profitability, cash flows, liquidity, or stock price will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict at this time. However, we
believe that given our strong balance sheet, with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2020, and the fact
that our business has increasingly shifted to digital channels, we have substantial flexibility as we navigate through the uncertain environment and near-
term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Products
We develop interactive entertainment content and services, principally for console, PC, and mobile devices, and we market and sell our games
primarily through digital distribution channels. Our products span various genres, including first- and third-person action/adventure, role-playing, strategy,
and “match three,” among others. We primarily offer the following products and services:
•premium full-games, which typically provide access to main game content after purchase;
•free-to-play offerings, which allow players to download the game and engage with the associated content for free;
•in-game content for purchase to enhance gameplay (i.e. microtransactions and downloadable content) available within both our full-games
and free-to-play offerings; and
•subscriptions for players in our World of Warcraft franchise that provide for ongoing access to the game content.
Providing additional content and experiences within franchises has increased opportunities for player investment outside of premium full-game
purchases. This has allowed us to shift from our historical seasonality to a more consistently recurring and year-round revenue model. In addition, if
executed properly, it allows us to increase player engagement with our games and content.
Product Development and Support
We focus on developing enduring wholly-owned franchises backed by well-designed, high-quality games with regular content updates. We aim to
build interactive entertainment content with the potential for broad reach, sustainable engagement, and year-round player investment. It is our experience
that enduring franchises then serve as the basis for related new products and content that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe that
the development and distribution of products and content based on established franchises enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high
unit volume sales and operating profits. We intend to continue development of content based on our owned franchises in the future.
We develop and produce our titles using a model in which a group of creative, technical, and production professionals, including designers,
producers, programmers, artists, and sound engineers, in coordination with our marketing, finance, analytics, sales, and other professionals, have
responsibility for the entire development and production process, including the supervision and coordination of internal and, where appropriate, external
resources. We believe this model allows us to deploy the best resources for a given task, including by supplementing our internal expertise with top-quality
external resources on an as-needed basis.
While most of our content is developed by our internal studios, we periodically engage independent third-party developers to create content on our
behalf. From time to time, we also acquire the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are, or will be, independently created by
third-party developers.
6
Table of Contents
We provide various forms of product support. Central technology and development teams review, assess, and provide support to products throughout
the development process. Quality assurance personnel are also involved throughout the development and production of published content. We subject all
such content to extensive testing before public release to ensure compatibility with appropriate hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the
number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support our content, we generally provide 24-hour game support to players through various
means, primarily online and by telephone.
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution
Many of our products contain software that enables us to connect with our gamers directly. This allows us to communicate and market directly to our
customers, including through customized advertising and in-game messaging based on customer preferences and trends. Our marketing efforts also include
activities on: online social networks; other online advertising; public relations activities; print and broadcast advertising; coordinated in-store and industry
promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays); participation in cooperative advertising programs; direct response vehicles; and
product sampling. From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers, producers of consumer products related to a game,
and retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts, as well as co-marketing from promotional partners.
Most of our products and content are available in a digital format, which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience
directly to their console, PC, or mobile device through our platform partners, including Apple Inc. (“Apple”), Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”), Google Inc.
(“Google”), Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), Nintendo Co., Ltd. (“Nintendo”), and Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. (“Sony”). Blizzard utilizes its
proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, to distribute most of Blizzard’s content and selected Activision content directly to PC consumers.
In addition to serving as a distribution platform, Blizzard Battle.net offers players communications features, social networking, player matching, and
digital content delivery and is designed to allow people to connect regardless of which of our games on Blizzard Battle.net they are playing.
Our physical products are available for sale in outlets around the world. These products are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers
(e.g., Target, Walmart), consumer electronics stores (e.g., Best Buy), discount warehouses, game specialty stores (e.g., GameStop), and other stores (e.g.,
Amazon), or through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements.
Manufacturing
We prepare master program copies for our products on each release platform. With respect to products for Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo consoles,
our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly, and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors or distribution
facilities owned by us.
Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products and license their hardware
technologies to us. In return, we pay an applicable royalty per unit once the manufacturer fills the product order, even if the units do not ultimately sell. We
deliver the master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator, who then manufactures the finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution
under our label.
Significant Customers and Top Franchises
Customers
While the Company does sell directly to end consumers in certain instances, such as sales through Blizzard Battle.net, in other instances our
customers are platform providers, such as Sony, Microsoft, Google, and Apple, or retailers, such as Walmart and GameStop, who act as distributors of our
content to end consumers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Sony, Apple, Google, and Microsoft were our most significant customers, with revenues
of 17%, 15%, 14%, and 11%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Apple, Google, and Sony were our most significant
customers, with revenues of 17%, 13%, and 11%, respectively, for 2019, and 15%, 11%, and 13%, respectively, for 2018. No other customer accounted for
10% or more of our net revenues in those periods.
We had two customers—Microsoft and Sony—who accounted for 28% and 21%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at December 31,
2020, and 11% and 18%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated gross receivables in those
periods.

Table of Contents
Top Franchises
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our top three franchises—Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft—collectively
accounted for 76%, 67%, and 58%, respectively, of our net revenues. No other franchise comprised 10% or more of our net revenues in those periods.
Competition
We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies and software competitors,
as well as with providers of different forms of entertainment, such as film, television, social networking, music, and other consumer products.
The interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive, and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly
introduced. We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features, game quality, and playability;
brand name recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use;
price of content; marketing support; and quality of customer service.
In addition to third-party software competitors, integrated video game console hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Sony, and
Nintendo, compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms, while at the same time act as key distribution
channels and payment gateways for our products and services through their digital storefronts. Apple and Google are similarly positioned on mobile
devices.
Intellectual Property
Like other interactive entertainment companies, our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual
property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted software code, patented technology, and other technology and trade secrets that we
use to develop and run our games. Other intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear, and interact
with when they are playing our games.
We develop a majority of our products based on wholly-owned intellectual properties, such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush. In
other cases, we obtain intellectual property through licenses and service agreements. Further, our products that play on consoles and mobile platforms
include technology that is owned by the platform provider and is licensed non-exclusively to us for use in the relevant product. We also license technology
from providers other than console manufacturers in developing our content and services. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business
is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates.
We are actively engaged in enforcement of our copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret rights against potential infringers of those rights along
with other protective activities, including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various enforcement initiatives,
education programs, and legislative activity around the world. For our PC products, we use technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use
of unauthorized copies of our products. For other platforms, the platform providers typically incorporate technological protections and other security
measures in their platforms to prevent the use of unlicensed products on those platforms.
Human Capital
We believe that our continued success and growth is directly related to our ability to attract, retain, and develop top talent. As of December 31, 2020,
Activision Blizzard had approximately 9,500 employees, with approximately 65% in North America, approximately 30% in the Europe, Middle East, and
Africa (“EMEA”) region, and approximately 5% in the Asia Pacific region. Of these employees, approximately 61% are personnel whose primary focus is
on game and technology development, which represents an approximate three percentage point increase from 2019. Activision Blizzard takes an active role
in the entirety of the employee lifecycle, from candidates to alumni. Recognizing that ours is a rapidly changing industry with constant technological
innovation, we remain focused on attracting, recruiting, enabling, developing, and retaining a diverse and innovative employee population.
8
Table of Contents
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”): We believe that a culture of inclusion and diversity enables us to create, develop, and fully leverage the
strengths of our workforce to exceed players' and fans' expectations and meet our growth objectives. We remain committed to building and sustaining a
culture of belonging, built on equitable processes and systems, where everyone thrives. By embedding DE&I practices and programs in the full employee
lifecycle, we work to recruit, attract, retain, and grow world-class talent. Our employee resource groups play an active role in our DE&I efforts by building
community and awareness. We also offer leadership and management development opportunities on the topics of unconscious bias and inclusive leadership
and train our recruiting workforce in diverse sourcing strategies.
Our Corporate Governance Principles and Policies provide that the initial list from which any new independent director nominee is chosen includes
qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates and, similarly, if we conduct an external search for a new CEO, that the initial list of external
candidates includes qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates. As of December 31, 2020, two of our ten directors were women.
Additionally, we have been recognized for our efforts to create an inclusive workplace, including receiving the distinction for two consecutive years
as a “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality” by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index. We are proud of these accolades
because we believe that the most innovative work comes from a culture in which all employees can be, and bring, their authentic and best selves.
Compensation and Benefits: The main objective of our compensation program is to provide a compensation package that attracts, retains, motivates,
and rewards top-performing employees that operate in a highly competitive and technologically challenging environment. We seek to do this by linking
compensation (including annual changes in compensation) to overall Company and business unit performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to
the results achieved. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align our employee’s financial interests with the interests of our
shareholders. We also seek fairness in total compensation by reference to external comparisons, internal comparisons, and the relationship between
development and non-development, as well as management and non-management, remuneration. We believe in equal pay for equal work, and we continue
to make efforts across our global organization to promote equal pay practices.
We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options, and it is our intention to offer benefits that allow our employees and their families to
live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of our wide-ranging benefits offered are: medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental
insurance, vision insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings
accounts, and flexible spending accounts. We frequently upgrade our benefit portfolio by seeking out pioneer partners that give our employees modern
benefit experiences. As an example, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional medical services became under huge demand, in order to help
ensure that our employees and their families had access to medical advice, we created an enterprise-wide global network of physicians.
Talent Assessment and Development: Recognizing that ours is a rapidly changing industry with constant innovation, developing our diverse and
innovative talent base is paramount, imperative, and vital to our business. We intend for our employees to have a clear understanding of their strengths and
development opportunities, while fostering a collaborative and productive relationship between employees and their managers. Talent assessment and
development are therefore critical aspects of our human capital programs. We employ a broad range of talent processes—for example, talent assessment,
succession planning, and performance management. Our performance management process includes the establishment of goals (at the beginning of the
year), and throughout the year we encourage regular check-ins on progress and performance so that employees have a clear understanding of their strengths
and areas for improvement. We regularly assess employee contributions to our Company results and culture so that we can appropriately recognize and
reward performance. Additionally, on an annual basis, we conduct an organizational and performance review process with our CEO and all segment,
business unit, and function leaders, focusing on our high-performing and high-potential talent, diverse talent, and the performance and succession for our
most critical roles.
Employee Experience: We capture and act on the voice of our employees through regular company-wide pulse surveys. We emphasize to employees
that this is their chance to “provide honest, candid feedback about their experience working for the company.” Our survey participation rates (regularly
75% or higher) demonstrate our collective commitment that Activision Blizzard remains a great place to work. The survey—and other forms of employee
feedback—result in actionable steps that lead to positive improvements to the employee experience at the company-wide, business unit, and team levels.
Our employee feedback is dynamic and relevant to our employees’ immediate needs. For example, most recent surveys focused on whether our employees
felt supported as they worked from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, and expectations of the employee population as we anticipate a return to the
office.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
We wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our
other filings with the SEC, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward‑looking statements contained in this
document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Further, the risks described below are
not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also
impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of
operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, or stock price.
We are unable to predict the full impact of the Global COVID-19 pandemic.
In December 2019, COVID-19 emerged and has since extensively impacted global health and the economic environment. On March 11, 2020, the
World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The full extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath will impact
our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, or stock price depends on numerous
evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict, including: the duration and severity of the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on the global
economy; the impact of governmental, business and individual actions that have been and will continue to be taken in response to the pandemic;
unintended consequences of actions we take, or have taken, in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on the health or productivity of our
employees and external developers, including the ability to develop high-quality and well-received interactive software products and entertainment content
and/or to release our products and content in a timely manner; the effects on the health, finances and discretionary spending patterns of our consumers,
including the ability of our consumers to pay for our products and content; our ability to sell products at assumed prices; the financial impact and strain on
the retail customers and distributors on whom we rely to sell our physical products to consumers; the financial impact and strain on platform providers for
whose video game consoles and/or on whose networks certain of our products are exclusively available; the financial impact and strain on third-party
mobile and web platforms that provide significant online distribution for, and/or provide other services critical for the operation of, a number of our games;
the effects on our suppliers who manufacture our physical products; the effects on other third parties with which we partner (e.g., to market or ship our
products); the effects on our lenders and financial counterparties; the effects on regulatory agencies around the world on which we rely; our ability to
continue to develop our emerging businesses, such as advertising; increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; the impact of recent and potential
upcoming or ongoing large-scale actions by local and federal governments and agencies or similar governing bodies in the U.S. and around the world, the
U.S. Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world, including the impact of any of these actions on the U.S. or world economy or global
financial markets; and any other factor which results in disruptions or increased costs associated with the development, production, post-production,
marketing and distribution of our products, and/or the digital advertising offered within our content. If the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adverse
effects in any one of these areas, our business may be negatively impacted. As in the case of COVID-19, the occurrence of other epidemics, medical
emergencies, and other public health crises outside of our control could have a negative impact on our business. Additionally, in the case of the COVID-19
pandemic, we have seen increased demand for our products due to stay-at-home orders, the curtailment of certain other forms of entertainment, and other
pandemic-related factors that make consumers more inclined to spend time at home, benefiting our financial results and operating metrics. The trends in
2020 for revenues, net income, and other financial results and operating metrics, may not be indicative of results for future periods, particularly if these
pandemic-related factors become less significant.
Our professional esports leagues (i.e. the Overwatch League and the Call of Duty League) and the franchise teams that make up the leagues generate
revenues from live in-person events. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the cancellation of live in-person events and any continued health and safety
concerns with large public gatherings may impact the ability of the teams in our leagues to hold future live in-person events. Prolonged COVID-19 risks
could result in teams being unable or unwilling to pay their franchise fees to us or participate in our leagues going forward. This, in turn, could result in the
loss of those future franchise fee payments, revenue from advertising, and other future potential league revenues or income, other benefits associated with
our esports business, and/or the termination of our leagues. Also, we have provided, and may continue to provide, concessions to the owners of the teams
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any one of these things could harm our business. Additionally, a prolonged impact of COVID-19 could heighten
many of the risk factors included in this Annual Report filed on Form 10-K.

Business and Industry Risks
If we do not consistently deliver popular, high‑quality content in a timely manner, if we are not successful in meaningfully expanding our franchises
further on the mobile platform, or if consumers prefer products from our competitors, our business may be negatively impacted.
Consumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and difficult to predict. Even the most successful games can lose consumer audiences over time,
and remaining popular is increasingly dependent on the games being refreshed with new content or other enhancements. In order to remain competitive and
maximize the chances that consumers select our products as opposed to the various entertainment options available to them and with which we compete,
we must continuously develop new products or new content for, or other enhancements to, our existing products. These products or enhancements may not
be well‑received by consumers, even if well‑reviewed and of high quality. Our competitors include very large corporations with significantly greater
financial, marketing and product development resources than we have and many smaller competitors, particularly on the mobile platform. Our larger
competitors may be able to leverage their greater financial, technical, personnel, and other resources to provide larger budgets for development and
marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties, as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to
develop more commercially successful video game products than we do. Further, competitors may develop content that imitates or competes with our
best‑selling games, potentially reducing our sales or our ability to charge the same prices we have historically charged for our products. These competing
products may take a larger share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause product sales to fall below expectations. If we do not continue
to develop consistently high‑quality and well‑received games or enhancements to those games, if our marketing fails to resonate with our consumers, if we
are not successful in meaningfully expanding our franchises further on the mobile platform, or if consumers lose interest in a genre of games we produce,
our revenues and profit margins could decline. In addition, our own best‑selling products could compete with our other games, reducing sales for those
other games. Further, a failure by us to develop a high‑quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well‑received, could
potentially result in additional expenditures to respond to consumer demands, harm our reputation, and increase the likelihood that our future products will
not be well‑received. The increased importance of downloadable content to our business amplifies these risks, as downloadable content for poorly‑received
games typically generates lower‑than‑expected sales. The increased demand for consistent enhancements to our products also requires a greater allocation
of financial resources to those products.
Additionally, consumer expectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be
critical of our brands, games, services, and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons, and such negative reactions may not be foreseeable or within
our control to manage effectively. For example, if our games or services, such as our proprietary online gaming service, do not function as consumers
expect, whether because they fail to function as advertised or otherwise, our sales may suffer. The risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with
respect to our games with online features because they involve ongoing consumer expectations, which we may not be able to consistently satisfy. Our
games with online features are also frequently updated, increasing the risk that a game may contain significant errors, or “bugs.” If any of these issues
occur, consumers may stop playing the game and may be less likely to return to the game as often in the future, which may negatively impact our business.
Further, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could negatively impact our business
and reputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially different from expectations. If we fail to release our products in a timely manner,
or if we are unable to continue to extend the life of existing games by adding features and functionality that will encourage continued engagement with the
game, our business may be negatively impacted.
Additionally, the amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of high‑quality products is increasing, and the longer the lead time
involved in developing a product and the greater the allocation of financial resources to such product, the more critical it is that we accurately predict
consumer demand for such product. If our future products do not achieve expected consumer acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction,
we may not be able to recover the substantial up‑front development and marketing costs associated with those products.

We depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.
We follow a franchise model, and a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively small number
of popular franchises. These products are also responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, in 2020, revenues
associated with the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for approximately 76% of our net revenues—and
a significantly higher percentage of our operating income. We expect that a relatively limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a
disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated
results by one or more products based on these franchises could negatively impact our business. Additionally, if the popularity of a franchise declines, as
has happened in the past with other popular franchises, we may have to write off the unrecovered portion of the underlying intellectual property assets,
which could negatively impact our business.
If we do not continue to attract, retain, and motivate skilled personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business.
Our success depends significantly on our ability to identify, attract, hire, retain, motivate, and utilize the abilities of qualified personnel, including in
some cases, external developers, particularly personnel with the specialized skills needed to create and sell the high‑quality, well‑received content upon
which our business is substantially dependent. Our industry is generally characterized by a high level of employee mobility, competitive compensation
programs, and aggressive recruiting among competitors for employees with technical, marketing, sales, engineering, product development, creative, and/or
management skills. We may have difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs to do so. If we are unable to attract
additional qualified personnel or retain and utilize the services of key personnel, it could have a negative impact on our business.
Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging
technologies and business models, our business may be negatively impacted.
Technology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry. We must continually anticipate and adapt to emerging technologies, such as
cloud-based game streaming, and business models, such as free-to-play and subscription-based access to a portfolio of interactive content, to stay
competitive. Forecasting the financial impact of these changing technologies and business models is inherently uncertain and volatile. Supporting a new
technology or business model may require partnering with a new platform, business, or technology partner, which may be on terms that are less favorable
to us than those for traditional technologies or business models. If we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products for distribution
channels that incorporate a new technology or business model that does not achieve significant commercial success, whether because of competition or
otherwise, we may not recover the often substantial up-front costs of developing and marketing those products, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting
management and financial resources away from other products or opportunities. Further, our competitors may adapt to an emerging technology or business
model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to consumers, or both.
If, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology, or otherwise elect not to pursue new
business models that achieve significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and expenditures to shift
product development resources to that technology or business model, and it may be more difficult to compete against existing products incorporating that
technology or using that business model.
The increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including greater competition.
The proportion of our revenues derived from digital distribution channels, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase. The increased
importance of digital channels in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally
delivered game, particularly a game for a mobile platform, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through
retail distribution and is played on a game console or PC. Also, while digitally‑distributed products generally have higher profit margins than retail sales, as
business shifts to digital distribution, the volume of orders from retailers for physical discs has been, and is expected to be, reduced. Further, some of the
providers of the platforms through which we digitally distribute content are also publishers of their own content distributed on those platforms, and,
therefore, a platform provider may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors.

The importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model.
While the proportion of our revenues derived from digital distribution channels, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase, retail
sales remain important to our business. Such sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long‑term agreements or other forms of
commitments, and due to the increased proportion of our revenue from digital distribution channels, our retail customers and distributors have generally
been reducing the levels of inventory they are willing to carry. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of Activision’s principal retail customers
or distributors, including digital distributors, could have adverse consequences.
We may be unable to effectively manage the continued growth and the scope and complexity of our business, including our expansion into new
business models that are untested and into adjacent business opportunities with large, established competitors.
We have experienced significant growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including through acquisitions and the development of our
esports, advertising, and consumer products businesses. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business and our
aspirations for continued expansion and growth. We have dedicated resources both to new business models that are largely untested, as is the case with
esports, and to adjacent business opportunities in which very large competitors have an established presence, as is the case with our advertising and
consumer products businesses. We do not know to what extent our future expansions will be successful. Further, even if successful, our aspirations for
growth in our core businesses and these adjacent businesses could create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources. If
not managed effectively, this growth could result in the over‑extension of our operating infrastructure, and our management systems, information
technology systems, and internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure by these new businesses or failure to
adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our brand or otherwise negatively impact our core business. Further, the success
of these new businesses is largely contingent on the success of our underlying franchises and as such, a decline in the popularity of a franchise may impact
the success of the new businesses adjacent to that franchise.
Due to our reliance on third‑party platforms, platform providers are frequently able to influence our products and costs.
Generally, when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by companies such as Sony and Microsoft,
the physical products are replicated exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator. The agreements with these manufacturers
include certain provisions, such as approval rights over all software products and related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they charge
for the manufacturing of products, which allow the hardware manufacturers substantial influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive
entertainment software products. During a console transition, like the one that occurred in 2020, as described below, these manufacturers may seek to
change the terms governing our relationships with them. In addition, because each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware
platforms and may manufacture products for other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors. Accordingly,
console manufacturers could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products, as well as increases to projected development, manufacturing,
marketing, or distribution costs, any of which could negatively impact our business.
Sony and Microsoft are also platform providers which control the networks over which consumers purchase digital products and services for their
platforms and through which we provide online game capabilities for our products. The control that these platform providers have over consumer access to
our games, the fee structures and/or retail pricing for products and services for their platforms and online networks and the terms and conditions under
which we do business with them could impact the availability of our products or the volume of purchases of our products made over their networks and our
profitability. The networks provided by these platform providers are the exclusive means of selling and distributing our content on these platforms. Further,
increased competition for limited premium “digital shelf space” has placed the platform providers in an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable
terms of sale. If the platform provider establishes terms that restrict our offerings on its platform, significantly alters the financial terms on which these
products or services are offered, or does not approve the inclusion of content on its platform, our business could be negatively impacted. We also derive
significant revenues from distribution on third‑party mobile and web platforms, such as the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook, which
are also our direct competitors and in some cases the exclusive means through which our content reaches gamers on those platforms, and most of the virtual
currency we sell is purchased using these platform providers’ payment processing systems. These platforms also serve as significant online distribution
platforms for, and/or provide other services critical for the operation of, a number of our games. If these platforms deny access to our games, modify their
current discovery mechanisms,

communication channels available to developers, operating systems, terms of service, or other policies (including fees), our business could be negatively
impacted. Additionally, if these platform providers are required to change how they label a game’s business model, such as free‑to‑play, or change how the
personal information of consumers is made available to developers, our business could be negatively impacted. These platform providers or their services
may be unavailable or may not function as intended or may experience issues with their in‑app purchasing functionality. As has sometimes happened in the
past, if any of these events occurs on a prolonged, or even short‑term, basis or other similar issues arise that impact players’ ability to access our games,
access social features, or make purchases, it may result in lost revenues and otherwise negatively impact our business.
Our business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game consoles manufactured by third parties, as well as our ability to develop
commercially successful products for these consoles.
We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on video game consoles manufactured by third parties, such as
Sony’s PS4 and PS5, Microsoft’s Xbox One and Series X, and Nintendo’s Switch. Sales of products for consoles accounted for 34% of our consolidated net
revenues in 2020. The success of our console business is driven in large part by our ability to accurately predict which consoles will be successful in the
marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these consoles. We also rely on the availability of an adequate supply of these
video game consoles and the continued support for these consoles by their manufacturers, including our ability to reach consumers via the online networks
operated by these console manufacturers. If increased costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our business could be negatively
impacted. If the consoles for which we develop new software products or modify existing products do not attain significant consumer acceptance, we may
not be able to recover our development costs, which could be significant.
Sony and Microsoft each launched next‑generation consoles in 2020. We have released titles that operate on these consoles, and we may continue to
develop games for these new console systems. When next-generation consoles are announced or introduced into the market, consumers have typically
reduced their purchases of game console entertainment software products for prior-generation consoles in anticipation of purchasing a next-generation
console and products for that console. During these periods, sales of the game console entertainment software products we publish may decline until new
platforms achieve wide consumer adoption. Console transitions may have a comparable impact on sales of downloadable content, amplifying the impact on
our revenues. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the next-generation consoles. In addition, as console hardware moves
through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions, and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on software prices.
During console transitions, we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop, market, and operate titles for prior‑generation video game
platforms, while also developing and supporting next‑generation platforms. As a result, our business and operating results may be more volatile and
difficult to predict during console transitions than during other times.
The increasing importance of free‑to‑play games to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including the dependence on a
relatively small number of consumers for a significant portion of revenues and profits from any given game.
We are increasingly dependent on our ability to develop, enhance, and monetize free‑to‑play games, such as the games in our Candy Crush franchise,
Hearthstone, Call of Duty: Mobile, and Call of Duty: Warzone. As such, we are increasingly exposed to the risks of the free‑to‑play business model. For
example, we may invest in the development of new free‑to‑play interactive entertainment products that do not achieve significant commercial success, in
which case our revenues from those products likely will be lower than anticipated and we may not recover our development costs. Further, our business
may be negatively impacted if: (1) we are unable to encourage new and existing consumers to purchase our virtual items; (2) we fail to offer monetization
features that appeal to these consumers;(3) our platform providers make it more difficult or expensive for players to purchase our virtual items; (4) we
cannot encourage significant additional consumers to purchase virtual items in our game and/or (5) our free-to-play releases reduce sales of our other
games.

We may not realize the expected benefits of our recent restructuring actions, and implementation of such actions may negatively impact our business.
During 2019, we began implementing a plan aimed at refocusing our resources on our largest opportunities and removing unnecessary levels of
complexity and duplication from certain parts of our business. While we believe this plan enables us to provide better opportunities for talent, and greater
expertise and scale over the long term, our ability to achieve the desired and anticipated benefits from the plan is subject to many estimates and
assumptions, and the actual savings and timing for those savings may vary materially based on factors such as local labor regulations, negotiations with
third parties, and operational requirements. These estimates and assumptions are also subject to significant economic, competitive, and other uncertainties,
some of which are beyond our control.
Additionally, there can be no assurance that our business will be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan. The
implementation of the plan may be more costly than we anticipated or have other negative consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in
workforce or negative impacts on employee morale and productivity, or on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Any of these
consequences could negatively impact our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that additional plans will not be required or implemented in the
future.
We engage in strategic transactions and may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of
these transactions.
As part of our business strategy, from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with,
complementary businesses. These transactions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: (1) in the case of an acquisition, (i) the potential
for the acquired business to underperform relative to our expectations and the acquisition price, (ii) the potential for the acquired business to cause our
financial results to differ from expectations in any given period, or over the longer‑term, (iii) unexpected tax consequences from the acquisition, or the tax
treatment of the acquired business’s operations going forward, giving rise to incremental tax liabilities that are difficult to predict, (iv) difficulty in
integrating the acquired business, its operations, and its employees in an efficient and effective manner, (v) any unknown liabilities or internal control
deficiencies assumed as part of the acquisition, and (vi) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses; and (2) in the case of an investment,
alliance, or joint venture, (i) our ability to cooperate with our partner, (ii) our partner having economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are
inconsistent with ours, and (iii) the potential that our partner may be unable to meet its economic or other obligations, which may require us to fulfill those
obligations alone. Further, any such transaction may involve the risk that our senior management’s attention will be excessively diverted from our other
operations, the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated, and that any intellectual property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those
needed for our future success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved.
We are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.
The interactive entertainment industry is somewhat seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the calendar year‑end
holiday buying season. As a result, our sales, particularly for our Activision segment, receivables, and credit risk, are higher during the fourth quarter of the
year, as consumers and retailers increase their purchases in anticipation of the holiday season. Delays in development, approvals or manufacturing could
affect the release of products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year‑end holiday buying season, which could negatively impact our
business.
Our business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development, and licensing partners, or other third parties with whom we are affiliated, act in
ways that put our brand at risk.
In many cases, our business partners and other third party affiliates, which may include, among others, individuals or entities affiliated with the
esports leagues we operate, are given access to sensitive and proprietary information or control over our intellectual property to provide services and
support to our team. These third parties may misappropriate or misuse our information or intellectual property and engage in unauthorized use of it.
Further, the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies
could result in a disruption to our business operations or an adverse effect on our reputation and may negatively impact our business. At the same time, if
the media, consumers, or employees raise any concerns about our actions vis-à-vis third parties including consumers who play our games, this could also
damage our reputation or our business.

We use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software,
products, and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business.
We use open source software in connection with some of the games and services we offer. Some open source software licenses require users who
distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative
works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and there
is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software.
Were it determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages
for breach of contract, re‑engineer our games or products, discontinue distribution in the event re‑engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or
take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts, any of which could negatively impact our business.
We are a global company and are subject to the risks and uncertainties of conducting business outside the U.S.
We conduct business throughout the world, and we derive a substantial amount of our revenues and profits from international trade, particularly from
Europe and Asia. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues and profits and, moreover, that
sales in emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere will continue to be an important part of our international sales. As such, we are, and may be increasingly,
subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally, as well as risks inherent in doing business in non-U.S. markets, including increased tariffs and duties,
compliance with economic sanctions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, shipping delays, increases in transportation costs, international political,
regulatory and economic developments, unexpected changes to laws, regulatory requirements, and enforcement on us and our platform partners and
differing local business practices, all of which may impact profit margins or make it more difficult, if not impossible, for us to conduct business in foreign
markets.
A deterioration in relations between either us or the United States and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the
implementation of government regulations in the United States or such a country, could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including
economic sanctions or absolute prohibitions, that could have a negative impact on our business. For instance, to operate in China, all games must have
regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to
sell in China in the future could have a negative impact on our business, as could delays in the approval process. Additionally, in the past, legislation has
been implemented in China that has required modifications to our products and our business model to satisfy regulatory requirements. The future
implementation of similar or new laws or regulations in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may restrict or prohibit the sale of
our products or may require engineering modifications to our products and our business model that are not cost‑effective, if even feasible at all, or could
degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to purchase such products. Changes in Chinese game approval procedures in 2018
have resulted in reduced rates of approval for games and unclear approval timeframes, making it uncertain as to if and when our new products will be
approved for release in China. Further, the continued enforcement of regulations relating to mobile and other games with an online element in China could
have a negative impact on our business in China.
In addition, cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and limit the international popularity of games that are popular in the U.S. or require
us to modify the content of the games or the method by which we charge our customers for the games to be successful. If we do not correctly assess
consumer preferences in the countries in which we sell our products, it could negatively impact our business.
We are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third‑party partners,
representatives, or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti‑Bribery Act or other similar anti‑bribery laws, as well as the
2017 U.K. Criminal Finances Act or other similar financial crime laws. While we have policies, procedures, and training for our employees, intended to
secure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, third‑party partners, representatives, or agents may take actions that violate our policies.
Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their
actions.

Our games may include undisclosed content or features. If our retailers refuse to sell such titles, or consumers refuse to purchase such titles, due to
what they perceive to be objectionable undisclosed content, it could have a negative impact on our business.
Throughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry, many interactive software products have included hidden content and/or hidden
gameplay features, some of which have been accessible through the use of in‑game codes or other technological means, that are intended to enhance the
gameplay experience. In some cases, such undisclosed content or features have been considered to be objectionable. While publishers are required to
disclose pertinent hidden content during the ESRB ratings process, in a few cases, publishers have failed to disclose hidden content, and the ESRB has
required the recall of the game, changed the rating or associated content descriptors originally assigned to the product, required the publisher to change the
game or game packaging and/or imposed fines on the publisher. Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by
removing these games from their shelves, refusing to sell them, and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, some
consumers have reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already
purchased, refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, on at least one occasion,
filing a lawsuit against the publisher of the product containing such content.
We have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the interactive
software products we publish. Nonetheless, these preventive measures are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding, and reasonable resource
constraints. If an interactive software product we publish is found to contain undisclosed content, we could be subject to any of these consequences.
Our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of objectionable consumer- or other third party‑created content.
Certain of our games and esports broadcasts support collaborative online features that allow consumers to communicate with one another and post
narrative comments, in real time, that are visible to other consumers. Additionally, certain of our games allow consumers to create and share
“user‑generated content” that is visible to other consumers. From time to time, objectionable and offensive consumer content may be distributed within our
games and on our broadcasts through these features or to gaming websites or other sites or forums with online chat features or that otherwise allow
consumers to post comments. We may be subject to lawsuits, governmental regulation or restrictions, and consumer backlash (including decreased sales
and harmed reputation), as a result of consumers posting offensive content.
Additionally, we have begun to generate revenue through offering advertising within certain of our franchises and in connection with our esports
broadcasts. The content of in‑game and esports broadcast advertisements is generally created and delivered by third‑party advertisers without our
pre‑approval, and, as such, objectionable content may be published in our games or during our esports broadcasts by these advertisers. This objectionable
third party‑created content may expose us to regulatory action or claims related to content, or otherwise negatively impact our business. We may also be
subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.

We depend on servers and networks to operate our games with online features and our proprietary online gaming service. If we were to lose
functionality in any of these areas for any reason, our business may be negatively impacted.
Our business relies on the continuous operation of servers, some of which are owned and operated by third parties. Although we strive to maintain
more than sufficient server capacity, and provide for active redundancy in the event of limited hardware failure, any broad‑based catastrophic server
malfunction, a significant service‑disrupting attack or intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures, a failure of disaster recovery service or the
failure of a company on which we are relying for server capacity to provide that capacity for whatever reason would likely degrade or interrupt the
functionality of our games with online features, and could prevent the operation of such games altogether, any of which could result in the loss of sales for,
or in, such games. The risk is particularly pronounced with respect to: (1) the mobile games published by King, which rely on a small number of third‑party
owned data centers located in one city; (2) the functioning of our proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, the disruption of which could
prevent Blizzard from delivering content digitally or render all of Blizzard games, as well as selected Activision content for the PC platform, unavailable;
and (3) the Company’s multiplayer game services, which rely on systems hosted in a hybrid of data centers across the world as well as cloud providers.
Further, insufficient server capacity could affect our ability to provide game services, which could negatively impact our business. Conversely, if we
overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business, we may incur additional operating costs.
We also rely on platforms and networks operated by third parties, such as the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and Steam, for the sale and digital
delivery of downloadable console and PC game content, the functionality of our games with online features. Similarly, we rely on those platforms and
networks, as well as the continued operation of the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook, for the sale of virtual currency and other
services for our free‑to‑play games. An extended interruption to any of these services could adversely affect our ability to sell and distribute our digital
products and operate our games with online features, which could result in a loss of revenue and otherwise negatively impact our business.
Any cybersecurity‑related attack, significant data breach, or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could
negatively impact our business.
In the course of our day‑to‑day business, we and third parties operating on our behalf create, store, and/or use commercially sensitive information,
such as the source code and game assets for our interactive entertainment software products and sensitive and confidential information with respect to our
customers, consumers, and employees. A malicious cybersecurity‑related attack, intrusion, or disruption by hackers (including through spyware,
ransomware, viruses, phishing, denial of service, and similar attacks) or other breach of the systems on which such source code and assets, account
information (including personal information), and other sensitive data is stored could lead to piracy of our software, fraudulent activity, disclosure, or
misappropriation of, or access to, our customers’, consumers’, or employees’ personal information, or our own business data. Such incidents could also
lead to product code‑base and game distribution platform exploitation, should undetected viruses, spyware, or other malware be inserted into our products,
services, or networks, or systems used by our consumers. We have implemented cybersecurity programs and the tools, technologies, processes, and
procedures intended to secure our data and systems, and prevent and detect unauthorized access to, or loss of, our data, or the data of our customers,
consumers, or employees. However, because these cyberattacks may remain undetected for prolonged periods of time and the techniques used by criminal
hackers and other third parties to breach systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative
measures. A data intrusion into a server for a game with online features or for our proprietary online gaming service could also disrupt the operation of
such game or platform. If we are subject to cybersecurity breaches, or a security‑related incident that materially disrupts the availability of our products and
services, we may have a loss in sales or subscriptions or be forced to pay damages or incur other costs, including from the implementation of additional
cyber and physical security measures, or suffer reputational damage. Additionally, although we maintain insurance policies, they may be insufficient to
reimburse the Company for all losses or all types of claims that may be caused by cyberbreaches or system or network disruptions, and it is uncertain
whether we will be able to maintain our current level of coverage in the future. Moreover, if there were a public perception that our data protection
measures are inadequate, whether or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and potential harm to our business relationships or the public
perception of our business model. In addition, such cybersecurity breaches may subject us to legal claims or proceedings, like individual claims and
regulatory investigations and actions, including fines, especially if there is loss, disclosure, or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers’ personal
information or other sensitive information, or there is otherwise an intrusion into our customers’ privacy.

Significant disruption during our live events may adversely affect our business.
We, as well as the teams in the esports leagues we operate, host numerous live events each year, many of which are attended by a large number of
people. There are many risks that are inherent in large gatherings of people, including the risk of an actual or threatened terrorist act, fire, explosion,
protests, and riots, and other safety or security issues, any one of which could result in injury or death to attendees and/or damage to the facilities at which
such an event is hosted. While we maintain insurance policies, they may be insufficient to reimburse us for all losses or all types of claims that may be
caused by such an event. Moreover, if there were a public perception that the safety or security measures are inadequate at the events we host or events
hosted by teams in the esports leagues we operate, whether or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and a decline in future attendance at
events hosted by us or those teams. Any one of these things could harm our business.
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
Our corporate headquarters and our primary corporate data center are located in the Los Angeles, California area, which is near a major earthquake
fault. A major earthquake or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology
systems, or otherwise prevents us from conducting our normal business operations, could require significant expenditures to resume operations and
negatively impact our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with such events could
exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not
be sufficient for all eventualities. Any such event could also limit the ability of retailers, distributors, or our other customers to sell or distribute our
products.
Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control.
Our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws contain a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and
special meetings. The regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain
shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the
issuance of so‑called “blank check” preferred stock. This ability of our Board of Directors to issue and fix the rights and preferences of preferred stock
could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control.
Regulatory and Legal Risks
We may be involved in legal proceedings that have a negative impact on our business.
From time to time, we are involved in claims, suits, investigations, audits, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including
with respect to intellectual property, competition and antitrust, regulatory, tax, privacy, labor and employment, compliance, unclaimed property, liability
and personal injury, product damage, collection, and/or commercial matters. In addition, negative consumer sentiment about our business practices may
result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups, as well as litigation.
Claims, suits, investigations, audits, and proceedings are inherently difficult to predict, and their results are subject to significant uncertainties, many
of which are outside of our control. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have a negative impact on us due to reputational harm, legal
costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. It is also possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial
settlements, judgments, fines or penalties, injunctions, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features,
functionalities, products, or services, requiring us to change our development process or other business practices.
There is also inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for these matters. Significant judgment is required in the analysis of these matters,
including assessing the probability of potential outcomes and determining whether a potential exposure can be reasonably estimated. In making these
determinations, we, in consultation with outside counsel, examine the relevant facts and circumstances on a quarterly basis assuming, as applicable, a
combination of settlement and litigated outcomes and strategies. Further, it may take time to develop factors on which reasonable judgments and estimates
can be based.

We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret
laws, and employee and third‑party non‑disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights, patents, trademarks,
and trade secrets. The process of registering and protecting these rights in various jurisdictions is expensive and time‑consuming. Further, we are aware that
some unauthorized copying and piracy occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying or piracy of our software products were to
occur, it could negatively impact our business. We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our
products in connection with emerging technologies or that we will be able to effectively protect our intellectual property through litigation and other means.
Our business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations,
our business could be negatively impacted.
The video game industry continues to evolve, and new and innovative business opportunities are often subject to new attempts at regulation. As such,
legislation is continually being introduced, and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place, that may affect the way in which we, and
other industry participants, may offer content and features, and distribute and advertise our products. These laws, regulations, and investigations are related
to protection of minors, gambling, screen time, business models, consumer privacy, accessibility, advertising, taxation, payments, intellectual property,
distribution, and antitrust, among others.
For example, many foreign countries have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict or prohibit marketing or distribution of interactive
entertainment software products because of the content therein (and similar legislation has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state
levels in the United States, including legislation that attempts to impose additional taxes based on content). In addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that
restrict or prohibit marketing or distribution of interactive entertainment software products with random digital item mechanics, which some of our online
games and services include, or subject such products to additional regulation and oversight, such as reporting to regulators. Certain jurisdictions also have
laws that restrict or prohibit certain types of esports tournaments. We also sometimes offer consumers of our online and casual games various types of
contests and promotional opportunities. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of tournaments and
games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Further, the growth and development of electronic
commerce, virtual items, and currency may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens or limitations on
operations of companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices, including related to screen time. Also, existing laws or
new laws regarding the marketing of in‑app purchases, regulation of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property, and money laundering may be
interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. Additionally, laws may limit or prevent the auto-renewal of contracts and subscriptions. Further, the
European Commission has recently imposed a large antitrust fine on a number of other game publishers who had been geoblocking certain EU countries. In
addition, in 2019 the World Health Organization included “gaming disorder” in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11),
leading some countries to consider legislation and policies aimed at addressing this issue. Moreover, the public dialogue concerning interactive
entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and consumers’ willingness to purchase our products.
The adoption and enforcement of legislation that restricts the marketing, content, business model, or sales of our products in countries in which we do
business may harm the sales of our products, as the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the potential audience for our products
may be limited. We may be required to modify certain product development processes or products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with
regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our products. In addition, the laws and regulations affecting our products vary by territory and
may be inconsistent with one another, imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions. Failure to comply with any applicable legislation may also result in
government‑imposed fines or other penalties, as well as harm to our reputation.

Change in government regulations relating to the Internet could negatively impact our business.
We rely on our consumers’ access to significant levels of Internet bandwidth for the sale and digital delivery of our content and the functionality of
our games with online features. Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity, or use of the Internet, including laws impacting
“net neutrality” or the availability of bandwidth could impair our consumers’ online video game experiences, decrease the demand for our products and
services or increase our cost of doing business. Although certain jurisdictions have implemented laws and regulations intended to prevent Internet service
providers from discriminating against particular types of legal traffic on their networks, other jurisdictions may lack such laws and regulations or repeal
existing laws or regulations. For example, in December 2017, the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal net neutrality regulations in the
U.S. and, following that decision, several states enacted net neutrality regulations. Given uncertainty around these rules relating to the Internet, including
changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal of those rules, coupled with the potentially significant political and economic power of local Internet
service providers and the relatively significant level of Internet bandwidth access our products and services require, we could experience discriminatory or
anti‑competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or otherwise negatively impact our business.
The laws and regulations concerning data privacy are continually evolving. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our
business.
Consumers play certain of our games online using our own distribution platforms, including Blizzard Battle.net, third‑party platforms and networks,
through online social platforms, and on mobile devices. We collect and store information about our consumers, including consumers who play these games.
In addition, we collect and store information about our employees. We are subject to laws from a variety of jurisdictions regarding privacy and the
protection of this information, including the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act,
which regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age, and the California Consumer Privacy Act,
among others. Failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations may increase our costs, subject us to expensive and distracting government
investigations, result in substantial fines, or result in lawsuits and claims against us to the extent these laws include a private right of action.
Data privacy protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future and may be inconsistent from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, the E.U. has traditionally taken a broader view than the United States and certain other jurisdictions as to what is
considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy and protection regulations, including those imposed under the
GDPR. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, as well as various U.S. state governments, are
continuing to review the need for greater regulation over the collection, sharing, use, or sale of personal information and information about consumer
behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices. Complying with emerging and changing laws could require us to incur substantial costs or impact our
approach to operating and marketing our games. Due to the rapidly changing nature of these data privacy protection laws, there is not always clear
guidance from the respective governments and regulators regarding the interpretation of the law, which may create the risk of an inadvertent violation.
Various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. In addition, in some cases,
we are dependent upon our platform providers and external data processors to assist us in ensuring compliance with these various types of regulations, and
a violation by one of these third parties may also subject us to government investigations and result in substantial fines.
Player interaction with our games is subject to our privacy policies, end user license agreements (“EULAs”), and terms of service. If we fail to
comply with our posted privacy policies, EULAs, or terms of service, or if we fail to comply with existing privacy‑related or data protection laws and
regulations, it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others, which could result in fines or judgments against us,
damage our reputation, impact our financial condition, and harm our business. If regulators, the media, consumers, or employees raise any concerns about
our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices, even if unfounded, this could also result in fines or judgments against us, damage our
reputation, negatively impact our financial condition, or damage our business.

Table of Contents
Our games are subject to scrutiny regarding the appropriateness of their content. If we fail to receive our target ratings for certain titles, or if our
retailers refuse to sell such titles due to what they perceive to be objectionable content, it could have a negative impact on our business.
Our console and PC games are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (the “ESRB”), a self‑regulatory body based in the U.S.
that provides U.S. and Canadian consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in such
software, such as violence, nudity, or sexual content, along with an assessment of the suitability of the content for certain age groups. Certain other
countries have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In addition, certain stores use other ratings
systems, such as Apple’s use of its proprietary “App Rating System” and Google Play’s use of the International Age Rating Coalition (“IARC”) rating
system. If we are unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products, it could have a negative impact on our business. In some instances, we may
be required to modify our products to meet the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product or may
prevent its sale altogether in certain territories. Further, if one of our games is “re‑rated” for any reason, a ratings organization could require corrective
actions, which could include a recall, retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers
could demand a refund for copies previously purchased.
Additionally, retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit
material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses, whether because a product received a certain rating by the ESRB or other
content rating system, or otherwise. If retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic
violence or sexually explicit material, or other generally objectionable content, we might be required to modify particular titles or forfeit the revenue
opportunity of selling such titles with that retailer.
Financial and Economic Risks
Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact our business.
Our income tax liability and effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business, the mix of
earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or tax rulings, changes in interpretations of existing laws, or developments in tax
examinations or investigations. Any of these factors could have a negative impact on our business or require us to change the manner in which we operate
our business. The tax regimes we are subject to, or operate under, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Furthermore, tax authorities may
choose to examine or investigate our tax reporting or tax liability, including under transfer pricing or permanent establishment theories. These proceedings
may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our income taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions.
Additionally, a number of countries are actively pursuing fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational companies like us,
including an increasing number that have enacted, or are considering enacting, revenue-based taxes on digital services. These digital services taxes target
various business activities, including online advertising and, in some cases, video game sales. While the scope and applicability of these taxes often
remains unclear, digital services taxes that ultimately apply to us could have an adverse impact on our business.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our business.
We transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in
local currencies, which could fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. Since we have significant international sales but incur the majority of our costs in the United
States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on
our business. We have, in the past, utilized currency derivative contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures and managed these exposures with
natural offsets. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue our hedging programs, or that we will be successful in managing exposure to
currency exchange rate risks whether or not we do so.

Table of Contents
Our reported financial results could be significantly impacted by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future
accounting standards to our business as it evolves.
Our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and national accounting standards bodies and the
methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. Policies affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further
significantly affect, the way we report revenues related to our products and services. We recognize a majority of the revenues from video games that
include an online service on a deferred basis over an estimated service period for such games. In addition, we defer the cost of revenues of those products.
Further, as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services, our estimate of the service period may change, and we could
be required to recognize revenues, and defer related costs, over a shorter or longer period of time. As we enhance, expand, and diversify our business and
product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and
income taxes, could have a significant impact on our reported net revenues, net income and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States in any given period.
The insolvency or business failure of any of our business partners could negatively impact us.
Our sales, whether digital or retail, are concentrated in a small number of large customers, which makes us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or
more of these large customers becomes unable to pay for our products or seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws. Retailers and distributors in the
interactive entertainment industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and a number of them have failed.
Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased and, as a result, our reserves for doubtful
accounts and write‑off of accounts receivable could increase and, even if increased, may turn out to be insufficient. While we have insurance to protect
against a customer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation, this insurance typically contains a significant deductible and co‑payment obligation and does
not cover all instances of non‑payment. Further, a payment default or the insolvency or business failure of, other types of business partners could result in
disruptions to the manufacturing or distribution of our products or the cancellation of contractual arrangements that we consider to be favorable, and could
negatively impact our business. In addition, having such a large portion of our total net revenues concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating
leverage with these customers.
Because our products and services are discretionary spending, if general economic conditions decline, demand for our products could decline.
Purchases of our products and services involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make
discretionary purchases, including purchases of products and services like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. As a result,
our products are sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. A reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could
result in an increase in our selling and promotional expenses, in an effort to offset that reduction, and could negatively impact our business.

Item 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Business Overview
Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute
content and services on video game consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. We also operate esports leagues and offer digital advertising within some of our
content. The terms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its
subsidiaries.
Our Segments
Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments, each of which is a leading global developer and
publisher of interactive entertainment content and services based primarily on our internally developed intellectual properties.
(i) Activision
Activision delivers content through both premium and free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from full-game and in-game sales, as
well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision also includes the activities of the Call
of Duty League, a global professional esports league with city-based teams.
(ii) Blizzard
Blizzard delivers content through both premium and free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from full-game and in-game sales,
subscriptions, and by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary
online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social
connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch League, a global professional esports league
with city-based teams.
(iii) King
King delivers content primarily through free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from in-game sales and in-game advertising on the
mobile platform.
Other
We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including the Distribution business, which consists of operations in
Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own
publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Business Results and Highlights
Financial Results
2020 financial highlights included:
•consolidated net revenues increased 25% to $8.1 billion and consolidated operating income increased 70% to $2.7 billion, as compared to
consolidated net revenues of $6.5 billion and consolidated operating income of $1.6 billion in 2019;
•diluted earnings per common share increased to $2.82, as compared to $1.95 in 2019; and
•cash flows from operating activities were approximately $2.25 billion, an increase of 23%, as compared to $1.83 billion in 2019.
Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the
transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated
service periods, which are generally less than a year. Net revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020, include a net effect of
$333 million and $238 million, respectively, from the deferral of net revenues and related cost of revenues.
Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 16% and 18% of total net revenues recognized were from revenue sources that were
recognized at a “point-in-time,” respectively, while “over-time and other” revenues were 84% and 82%, of total net revenues, respectively. Revenue
recognized at a “point-in-time” is primarily comprised of the portion of revenue from software products that is recognized when the customer takes control
of the product (i.e., upon delivery of the software product) and revenues from our Distribution business. “Over-time and other revenue” is primarily
comprised of revenue associated with the online functionality of our games, in-game purchases, and subscriptions.
Content Release and Event Highlights
Throughout the year we regularly release new content through seasonal and live services updates within our franchises, including Call of Duty,
Candy Crush, and Hearthstone. In addition to these updates, notable game releases during 2020, included:
•Activision’s Call of Duty: Warzone, a free-to-play experience on console and PC platforms;
•Activision’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2;
•Activision’s Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time;
•Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War; and
•Blizzard’s World of Warcraft: Shadowlands.
International Sales
International sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is specifically
directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 52%, 54%, and 54% of our total
consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries
are generated by consumers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the U.K. Our international
business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local
economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local
economies.TM TM

Operating Metrics
The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. The key drivers of changes in our operating
metrics are presented in the order of significance.
Net bookings and In-game net bookings
We monitor net bookings and in-game net bookings as key operating metrics in evaluating the performance of our business because they enable an
analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers and provide a more timely indication of trends in our operating
results. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise,
and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals. In-game net bookings primarily
includes the net amount of microtransactions and downloadable content sold during the period, and is equal to in-game net revenues excluding the impact
from deferrals.
Net bookings and in-game net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions):
For the Y ears Ended December 31,Increase
(Decr ease) 2020 2019
Net bookings $ 8,419 $ 6,388 $ 2,031 
In-game net bookings $ 4,852 $ 3,366 $ 1,486 
Net bookings
The increase in net bookings for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to:
•a $1.7 billion increase in Activision net bookings driven by higher net bookings from (1) Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (which was released
in October 2019, and when referred to herein, is inclusive of Call of Duty: Warzone, from its release in March 2020 through December 16,
2020, the launch date of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Season 1 content; after December 16, 2020, Call of Duty: Warzone revenues are
associated with Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War content and included within that title’s revenue), as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4,
which was released in October 2018, (2) Call of Duty: Mobile, which was released in October 2019, and (3) the Call of Duty franchise catalog
titles, partially offset by lower net bookings from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which was released in March 2019;
•a $186 million increase in Blizzard net bookings driven by higher net bookings from World of Warcraft, which includes the release of World
of Warcraft: Shadowlands in November 2020, partially offset by lower net bookings from Overwatch;
•a $133 million increase in King net bookings driven by higher net bookings from advertising and in-game player purchases, primarily in the
Candy Crush franchise; and
•a $116 million increase in net bookings from our Distribution business.
In-game net bookings
The increase in in-game net bookings for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to:
•a $1.4 billion increase in Activision in-game net bookings, driven by higher in-game net bookings from (1) Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, as
compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 and (2) Call of Duty: Mobile; and
•a $75 million increase in Blizzard in-game net bookings, driven by World of Warcraft.TM

Monthly Active Users
We monitor monthly active users (“MAUs”) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed
a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period
and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition,
due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would
be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be
counted as a single user. In certain instances, we rely on third parties to publish our games. In these instances, MAU data is based on information provided
to us by those third parties, or, if final data is not available, reasonable estimates of MAUs for these third-party published games.
The number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a
temporary surge in MAUs. Accordingly, although we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric,
period-to-period fluctuations may not be indicative of longer-term trends. The following table details our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for
each of our reportable segments (amounts in millions):
December 31, 2020 September 30, 2020 June 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019
Activision 128 111 125 102 128 
Blizzard 29 30 32 32 32 
King 240 249 271 273 249 
Total 397 390 428 407 409 
Average MAUs increased by 7 million, or 2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2020, primarily due to an increase in average MAUs for Activision driven by the Call of Duty franchise due to (1) the November 2020 launch of Call of
Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and (2) the December 2020 launch of Call of Duty: Mobile in China. The increase was partially offset by lower average MAUs
across various franchises at King.
Average MAUs decreased by 12 million, or 3%, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the three months ended
December 31, 2019. The year-over-year decrease in average MAUs is due to:
•lower average MAUs across King’s various franchises, primarily from non-Candy Crush franchises; and
•lower average MAUs across Blizzard, primarily from Overwatch.
Management’s Overview of Business Trends
Impacts of the Global COVID-19 Pandemic
Refer to the “Impacts of the Global COVID-19 Pandemic” section under Part I, Item 1 “Business” for discussion on the impacts of COVID-19 on our
business.
Interactive Entertainment Growth
Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we
estimate, based on consumer spending, that the total industry has grown, on average, 17% annually from 2017 to 2020. The industry continues to benefit
from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions
gain access to this form of entertainment.
32
Table of Contents
Mobile Gaming and Free-to-Play Games
Wide adoption of smartphones globally and the free-to-play business model on mobile platforms have increased the total addressable audience for
gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile
gaming is estimated to be larger than console and PC gaming, and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-
play games, and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional
player investment in, our franchises. The 2019 launch of Call of Duty: Mobile is an example of these efforts.
In addition, the free-to-play business model, which allows players to try a new game with no upfront cost, has begun to receive broader acceptance on
PC and console platforms. This provides opportunities for us to increase the reach of our franchises through free-to-play offerings, which, in turn, provides
opportunities to further drive player investment, as was seen with our recent Call of Duty: Warzone release.
Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises
The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. Of the top
10 gaming franchises in the U.S. in 2020, all 10 were established prior to 2020.
A significant portion of our revenues historically has been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises, and these video games have
also been responsible for a disproportionately higher percentage of our profits. For example, in 2020, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft
franchises, collectively, accounted for 76% of our consolidated net revenues—and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income.
In addition to investing in new content for our top franchises, with the aim of releasing such content more frequently, we are continually exploring
additional ways to expand those franchises, such as our recent release of Activision’s Call of Duty: Warzone. Additionally, we have been increasing our
development efforts to focus on expanding our franchises to the mobile platform, as demonstrated by the release of Call of Duty: Mobile, as well as our
plans for Diablo Immortal™ and Crash Bandicoot: On the Run!™, which are both currently in development.
Overall, we expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the
industry’s, revenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against
our competitors’ top franchises can significantly impact our performance.
Recurring Revenue Business Models
Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more
consistently recurring and year-round model. While our business does continue to experience some periods of “seasonality” driven primarily by the timing
of our releases of new premium full games, our in-game content and free-to-play offerings allow our players to access and invest in new content throughout
the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, but it can also increase player engagement.
Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games
Our fans spend significant time engaging in our franchises and investing through purchases of our game content, including full games and in-game
content. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment
in our franchises outside of games, such as with our Overwatch and Call of Duty leagues. Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still
relatively nascent.
33
Table of Contents
Upcoming Content Release Highlights
In the second half of 2021, we plan to release the next premium title in our Call of Duty franchise. In addition, throughout the year we expect to
deliver ongoing content for our various franchises, including continued in-game content for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which includes seasonal
content updates for Call of Duty: Warzone, seasonal content updates for Call of Duty: Mobile, content updates for World of Warcraft, expansion packs and
content updates for Hearthstone, and continued releases of content, features, and services across King’s portfolio with an ongoing focus on the Candy
Crush franchise. We will also continue to invest in opportunities that we think have the potential to drive our growth over the long-term, including
continuing to build on our advertising initiatives and investments in mobile titles, some of which we anticipate will launch in 2021, including Crash
Bandicoot: On the Run and Diablo Immortal.

(1)    In-game net revenues primarily includes the net amount of revenue recognized for microtransactions and downloadable content during the period.
Consolidated net revenues
The increase in consolidated net revenues for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily driven by an increase in revenues of $1.9 billion due to
higher revenues from:
•Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which was released in October 2019, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was released in
October 2018;
•Call of Duty: Mobile, which was released in October 2019;
•World of Warcraft, which includes the release of World of Warcraft: Shadowlands in November 2020;
•our Distribution business;
•the Candy Crush franchise; and
•the Call of Duty franchise catalog titles.
The increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $339 million due to lower revenues from:
•Overwatch;
•Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which was released in November 2020, as compared to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare; and
•Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which was released in March 2019.
In-game net revenues
The increase in in-game net revenues for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily driven by an increase in in-game net revenues of $1.2 billion due
to higher in-game net revenues from:
•Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4; and
•Call of Duty: Mobile.

Operating Segment Results
We have three reportable segments—Activision, Blizzard, and King. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations
are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The CODM reviews segment
performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games;
share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees,
expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings; certain restructuring and related costs; and certain other
non-cash charges. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is
made with respect thereto.
Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal organizational structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources,
and the availability of separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments.

Segment Net Revenues
Activision
The increase in Activision’s segment net revenues for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to higher revenues from:
•Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which was released in October 2019, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was released in
October 2018;
•Call of Duty: Mobile, which was released in October 2019; and
•the Call of Duty franchise catalog titles.
38
Table of Contents
The increase was partially offset by lower revenues from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which was released in March 2019.
Blizzard
The increase in Blizzard’s segment net revenues for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to higher revenues from World of Warcraft, which
includes the release of World of Warcraft: Shadowlands in November 2020. The increase was partially offset by lower revenues from Overwatch.
King
The increase in King’s net revenues for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to higher revenues from advertising and in-game player
purchases, primarily in the Candy Crush franchise.
Segment Income from Operations
Activision
The increase in Activision’s operating income for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to higher segment net revenues.
The increase was partially offset by:
•higher cost of revenues and marketing costs for the Call of Duty franchise; and
•higher product development costs driven by higher personnel bonuses as a result of strong business performance.
Blizzard
The increase in Blizzard’s operating income for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to:
•higher segment net revenues;
•lower product development costs, despite an increase in personnel costs, driven by higher capitalization of software development costs from
the timing of game development cycles; and
•lower general and administrative costs.
The increase was partially offset by higher cost of revenues, primarily from higher software amortization and higher marketing costs related to the
launch of World of Warcraft: Shadowlands.
King
The increase in King’s operating income for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to:
•higher segment net revenues; and
•lower general and administrative costs.
The increase was partially offset by higher marketing costs, driven by the Candy Crush franchise.
Foreign Exchange Impact
 
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $61 million and a negative impact of $126 million on reportable segment net revenues for
2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to the euro and British pound.

This increase was partially offset by lower revenues from Overwatch.
Retail Channel Net Revenues
The decrease in net revenues from retail channels for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to lower revenues from:
•Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which was released in November 2020, as compared to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare; and
•Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which was released in March 2019.
The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues from:

standalone sales of toys and accessories.
(2)Net revenues from “Other” primarily includes revenues from our Distribution business, the Overwatch League, and the Call of Duty League.
Console
The increase in net revenues from the console platform for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to higher revenues from Call of Duty:
Modern Warfare, which was released in October 2019, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was released in October 2018. The increase was
partially offset by lower revenues from Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which was released in November 2020, as compared to Call of Duty: Modern
Warfare.
PC
The increase in net revenues from the PC platform for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to higher revenues from:
•Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4; and
•World of Warcraft, which includes the release of World of Warcraft: Shadowlands in November 2020.
The increase was partially offset by lower revenues from Overwatch.
Mobile and Ancillary
The increase in net revenues from mobile and ancillary for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to higher revenues from:
•Call of Duty: Mobile, which was released in October 2019; and
•the Candy Crush franchise, driven by higher revenues from advertising and in-game player purchases.

Cost of Revenues—Product Sales:
The increase in product costs for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to an increase in product costs for our Distribution business as a result
of higher revenues.
The increase in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2020, as compared to 2019, was
primarily due to a $32 million increase in software amortization and royalties from Activision, driven by software amortization and royalties from the 2020
releases of (1) Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2, (2) Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, and (3) Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered;
partially offset by lower software amortization and royalties from:
•Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which was released in March 2019; and
•Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which was released in October 2019, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was released in
October 2018.
Cost of Revenues—In-game, Subscription, and Other Revenues:
The increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to (1) an increase of $114 million in service
provider fees such as digital storefront fees (e.g., fees retained by Apple and Google for our sales on their platforms), payment processor fees, and server
bandwidth fees, as a result of higher revenues, and (2) an increase of $64 million associated with our professional esports leagues, which includes event and
production costs associated with the inaugural season of the Call of Duty League in 2020.
The decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to in-game, subscription, and other revenues for 2020, as
compared to 2019, was primarily due to a decrease of $128 million in amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired as part of
our 2016 acquisition of King. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in software amortization and royalties from Activision of $46 million, driven
by Call of Duty: Mobile, which was released in October 2019.

During 2019, we began implementing a plan aimed at refocusing our resources on our largest opportunities and to remove unnecessary levels of
complexity and duplication from certain parts of our business. Since then, we have been, and will continue focusing on these goals as we continue to
execute against our plan. The restructuring and related costs incurred during 2020 relate primarily to severance costs. We do not expect to realize
significant net savings in our total operating expenses as a result of our plan, as cost reductions in our selling, general and administrative activities is
expected to be offset by increased investment in product development. Refer to Note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in

The increase in interest and other expense (income), net, for 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily due to:
•a $58 million decrease in interest income driven by lower returns on our investment portfolio as a result of interest rate cuts, reflecting actions
by central banks around the world;
•a $38 million gain recognized in the prior-year period as a result of adjusting a cost-method equity investment to fair value, as compared to a
$3 million gain recorded in the current year; and

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s income before income tax expense was $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively,
and our income tax expense was $419 million (or a 16% effective tax rate) and $130 million (or an 8% effective tax rate), respectively. Our full year 2020
effective tax rate of 16% is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a U.S. tax benefit from foreign-derived intangible income, a one-time
benefit from deferred tax asset remeasurement, and excess tax benefits from share-based payments.
The effective tax rate in 2020 was higher than in 2019, primarily due to one-time tax benefits reported in the prior year related to the intra-entity
transfer of certain intellectual property rights, partially offset by changes in the Company's liability for uncertain tax positions and audit settlements.
The overall effective income tax rate in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, such as changes in pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction,
applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, and rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audits and other matters, and
variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income or loss.
Further analysis of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective tax rate, as well as other information about
our income taxes, is provided in Note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Exchange Impact
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $62 million and a negative impact of $150 million on our consolidated net revenues in
2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year.
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $35 million and a negative impact of $71 million on our consolidated operating income in
2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. Despite the impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, in the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate
significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of
$8.8 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing
requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as potential dividend payments
or share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities (the next of which is in 2026), include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash
flows provided by operating activities.
As of December 31, 2020, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $2.5 billion, as compared
to $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. These cash balances are generally available for use in the U.S., subject in some cases to certain restrictions.
Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are
generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to
increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural
changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 2,854 $ 1,569 $ 1,285 
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
The primary driver of net cash flows associated with our operating activities is the income generated from the sale of our products and services. These
are typically partially offset by: working capital requirements used in the development, sale, and support of our products; payments for interest on our debt;
payments for tax liabilities; and payments to our workforce.
Net cash provided by operating activities for 2020 was $2.25 billion, as compared to $1.83 billion for 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher
net income, partially offset by higher tax payments and changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments,
changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.
45
Table of Contents
Net cash used in investing activities for 2020 was $178 million, as compared to $22 million for 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities
was primarily due to the net purchases of available-for-sale investments of $100 million in 2020, as compared to net proceeds from maturities of available-
for-sale investments of $88 million in 2019. This was partially offset by capital expenditures of $78 million in 2020, which were lower than the capital
expenditures of $116 million in 2019.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt
and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well
as the payment of dividends.
Net cash provided by financing activities for 2020 was $711 million, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $237 million for 2019.
The change was primarily attributed to:
•our debt financing activities—for 2020 we had net debt proceeds of approximately $896 million resulting from the issuance of an aggregate
principal amount of $2.0 billion of new notes and the early redemption of $1.05 billion of our previously outstanding notes, with no
comparable activity for 2019 (refer to Note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K for further discussion); and
•higher proceeds from issuances of common stock to employees of $170 million in 2020 as compared to $105 million in 2019.
The cash flows provided by the activities above were partially offset by higher dividends paid, with $316 million of dividend payments in 2020, as
compared to $283 million for 2019.
Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes
Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $69 million and a negative impact of $3 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change is primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and
British pound.
Debt
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our total outstanding debt was $3.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, bearing interest at a
weighted average rate of 2.87% and 3.18%, respectively.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred
to as “structured finance” or “special purpose” entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually
narrow or limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business
operations are discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect
our reported and expected financial results. The policies, estimates, and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be critical because
they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant
demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs.
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. On January 1, 2018, we
adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments.
We generate revenue primarily through the sale of our interactive entertainment content and services, principally for the console, PC, and mobile
platforms, as well as through the licensing of our intellectual property. Our products span various genres, including first- and third-person action/adventure,
role-playing, strategy, and “match three.” We primarily offer the following products and services:
•premium full games, which typically provide access to main game content after purchase;
•free-to-play offerings, which allow players to download the game and engage with the associated content for free;
•in-game content for purchase to enhance gameplay (i.e.microtransactions and downloadable content) available within both our full-game and
free-to-play offerings; and
•subscriptions to players in our World of Warcraft franchise, which provide ongoing access to the game content.
When control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the
consideration we expect to receive in exchange for these products and services.
We determine revenue recognition by:
•identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•identifying the performance obligations in each contract;
•determining the transaction price;
•allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in each contract; and
•recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.
Certain products are sold to customers with a “street date” (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we
recognize revenues on the later of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer. For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we
recognize revenue when it is available for download or is activated for gameplay. Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities
that are imposed at the time of the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer, such as sales and value-added taxes.
48
Table of Contents
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment immediately upon purchase or
within 30 to 90 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we do not adjust the promised amount of
consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised
product or service to our customer and payment for that product or service will be one year or less.
Product Sales
Product sales consist of sales of our games, including digital full-game downloads and physical products. We recognize revenues from the sale of our
products after both (1) control of the products has been transferred to our customers and (2) the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied.
Such revenues, which include our software products with significant online functionality and our online hosted software arrangements, are recognized in
"Product sales" on our consolidated statement of operations.
Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection, which are accounted for as
variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and price protection are estimated at contract inception and updated at
the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.
Sales incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the
transaction price of our products and are reflected as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for
distinct goods or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer’s national circular advertisement, are recorded as “Sales and
marketing” expense when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of
the good or service.
Products with Online Functionality
For our software products that include both offline functionality (i.e., do not require an Internet connection to access) and significant online
functionality, such as for most of our titles from the Call of Duty franchise, we evaluate whether the license of our intellectual property and the online
functionality each represent separate and distinct performance obligations. In such instances, we typically have two performance obligations: (1) a license
to the game software that is accessible without an Internet connection (predominantly the offline single player campaign or game mode) and (2) ongoing
activities associated with the online components of the game, such as content updates, hosting of online content and gameplay, and online matchmaking
(the “online functionality”). The online functionality generally operates to support the additional features and functionalities of the game that are only
available online, not the offline license. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on, including downloadable content. When
we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual property (i.e., the offline software license) that is separate and distinct from the
online functionality, we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the standalone selling price for the performance obligations,
since we do not generally sell the software license on a standalone basis. These products may be sold in a bundle with other products and services, which
often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations.
For arrangements that include both a license to the game software that is accessible offline and separate online functionality, we recognize revenue
when control of the license transfers to our customers for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the offline software license and ratably over the
estimated service period for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the online functionality. Similarly, we defer a portion of the cost of revenues on
these arrangements and recognize the costs as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are deferred include product costs, distribution
costs, and software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses, and excludes intangible asset amortization.
49
Table of Contents
Online Hosted Software Arrangements
For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all
gameplay and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player. In these instances, we typically have a single
performance obligation related to our ongoing activities in the hosted arrangement, including content updates, hosting of the gameplay, online
matchmaking, and access to the game content. Similar to our software products with online functionality, these arrangements may include other products
and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are
generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period.
In-game, Subscription, and Other Revenues
In-game Revenues
In-game revenues primarily includes revenue from microtransactions and downloadable content. Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale
of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from these sales of virtual currencies and goods are initially
recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with
a virtual currency. Proceeds from the direct sales of virtual goods are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize
our virtual goods as either “consumable” or “durable.” Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action;
accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and our performance obligation is satisfied.
Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of
durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally the
estimated service period.
Subscription Revenues
Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of Warcraft, which is only playable online and is generally sold on a subscription-
only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then
recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.
Revenues attributable to the purchase of World of Warcraft software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as “Product sales,”
whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as “In-game, subscription, and other revenues.”
Other Revenues
Other revenues primarily include revenues from software licensing and licensing of intellectual property other than software. These revenues are
recognized in "In-game, subscription, and other revenues" on our consolidated statement of operations.
In certain countries we have software licensing arrangements where we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance
with license agreements, for which the licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee and sales-based royalties. These arrangements typically
include multiple performance obligations, such as an upfront license of intellectual property and rights to specified or unspecified future updates. Our
estimate of the selling price is comprised of several factors including, but not limited to, prior selling prices, prices charged separately by other third-party
vendors for similar service offerings, and a cost-plus-margin approach. Based on the allocated transaction price, we recognize revenue associated with the
minimum guarantee (1) when we transfer control of the upfront license of intellectual property, (2) upon transfer of control of future specified updates,
and/or (3) ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the customer with unspecified future updates. Royalty payments in excess of the minimum
guarantee are generally recognized when the licensed product is sold by the licensee.
50
Table of Contents
Revenues from the licensing of intellectual property other than software primarily include the licensing of our (1) brand, logo, or franchise to
customers and (2) media content. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our brand or franchise are generally recognized over the license
term. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our media content are generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which
may be upfront or over time.
Significant Judgment around Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are
considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Certain of our
games, such as titles in the Call of Duty franchise, may contain a license of our intellectual property to play the game offline, but may also depend on a
significant level of integration and interdependency with the online functionality. In these cases, significant judgment is required to determine whether this
license of our intellectual property should be considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the online
functionality provided and recognized over time. Generally, for titles in which the software license is functional without the online functionality and a
significant component of gameplay is available offline, we believe we have separate performance obligations for the license of the intellectual property and
the online functionality.
Significant judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and to determine whether
there is a discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of the various products and services. To estimate the standalone
selling price we generally consider market data, including our pricing strategies for the product being evaluated and other similar products we may offer,
competitor pricing to the extent data is available, and the replayability design of both the offline and online components of our games. In limited instances,
we may also utilize an expected cost approach to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an appropriate profit margin.
Estimated Service Period
We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number
of days between players’ first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes,
and the weighted-average number of days between players’ first purchase date and last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the
service periods of our previously released games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors’ games that are similar in
nature to ours. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our customers, as it is the best representation of the time period
during which our customers play our games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management’s judgment. Future usage
patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for
players of our current games are less than 12 months.
Principal Agent Considerations
We evaluate sales of our products and content via third-party digital storefronts, such as Microsoft’s Xbox Games Store, Sony’s PSN, the Apple App
Store, and the Google Play Store, to determine whether our revenues should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. Key indicators that
we evaluate in determining whether we are the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited to:
•which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and
•which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.
Based on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via the Apple App Store and the Google
Play Store, and we report revenues on a net basis (i.e., net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsoft’s Xbox Games
Store and Sony’s PSN.

Income Taxes
We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 740, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets
each period for recoverability. For those assets that do not meet the threshold of “more likely than not” that they will be realized in the future, a valuation
allowance is recorded.
Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning
strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all
or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax
expense in the period such determination is made.
The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC Topic 740 and
complex tax laws. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of
previously paid taxes. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on our
business and results of operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our
reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our
historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the
refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the
provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and
changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and are regularly subject to audit by other tax authorities. We
regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There
can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which also created a new minimum tax that applies to certain foreign earnings
(“GILTI”). We have elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years.

Software Development Costs
Software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed products, as well as payments made to independent software
developers under development agreements. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and
such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design
documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the
development cycle. Software development costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is
complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Significant management
judgments and estimates are applied in assessing when capitalization commences for software development costs and the evaluation is performed on a
product-by-product basis. Prior to a product’s release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of
“Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses.” Capitalized costs for products that are canceled or are expected to
be abandoned are charged to “Product development” in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are
charged immediately to “Product development.”
Commencing upon a product’s release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization,
and intellectual property licenses” based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an
amortization period of six months to approximately two years.
We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released, the
primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods,
recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or
copyright is to be used. Additionally, criteria used to evaluate expected product performance may include, as appropriate: historical performance of
comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general
market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based.
Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If
revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable
value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material differences may result in the
amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management’s expectations.

included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, with a heightened risk for volatility in the future due to potential impacts of COVID-19 on global financial markets. Revenues and related
expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. Primary currencies include euros,
British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign
currencies, the translation of these foreign currency-denominated transactions will result in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash
flows from our international operations. Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows will increase for our international
operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the
United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional
impact on our business. We monitor currency volatility throughout the year.
To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings and our foreign
currency risk related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency
derivative contracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for our
currency derivative contracts are large and reputable commercial or investment banks.
The fair values of our foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end
of the period.
We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
For a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for our foreign currency forward contracts, see Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Hedges (“Cash Flow Hedges”) and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as
Hedges
Refer to Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosures
regarding our Cash Flow Hedges and foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges.
In the absence of hedging activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10%
would have resulted in a theoretical decline of our net income of approximately $191 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of
all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however, all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in this manner and actual
results may differ materially.
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, as our outstanding debt is all at fixed rates.
Our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds and government securities with high credit quality and short average maturities.
Because short-term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then-current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of
cash, cash equivalents, or short-term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. Conversely, the fair value of
such a portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. At December 31, 2020, our $8.6 billion of cash and cash
equivalents was comprised primarily of money market funds.
54
Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2020, based on the composition of our investment portfolio and recent actions by central banks around the world, including the
interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, we anticipate investment yields may remain low, which would continue to negatively impact our future
interest income. Such impact is not expected to be material to the Company’s liquidity.

Item 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Definition and Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to
reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is: (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms; and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose
material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures
include, but are not limited to, the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In addition, we
have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system
of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all possible future events.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2020, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that, at December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported on a timely basis, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2020, of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that, at December 31, 2020, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the
most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Additionally, we have not experienced any material impact to our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures despite
the fact that most of our employees are working remotely for their health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and
assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Activision Blizzard, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as
of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Changes in Accounting Principles
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the
manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

Table of Contents
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition – Determination ofService Period for Online Functionality
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, a portion of the Company’s $8.1 billion of revenues for the year ended December 31,
2020, is recognized ratably over the estimated service period for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the online functionality, which is generally
less than twelve months. When determining the estimated service period for players of the Company’s games, management considers a variety of data
points including the weighted-average number of days between the players’ first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average
number of days in which the player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of days between players’ first purchase date and last date played
online. Management also considers known online trends, the service period of their previously released games, and the service period of their competitors’
games that are similar in nature, to the extent they are publicly available. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management’s
judgment.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - determination of the service period for
the online functionality is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the service period, which in turn led to a
high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate audit evidence relating to the data used in developing the
service period assumption, such as the player data assessed by management for historical or comparable titles to determine the weighted-average number of
days between players’ first purchase date and last date played online, as well as qualitative factors utilized by management, such as analysis of competitor
information.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the determination of the service period for the
online functionality. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the service period, (ii) testing
management’s method of analyzing player data, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the determination of the service
period estimate, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the service period by comparing it to similar or historical titles and competitor information.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation and Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-year amounts to conform to the current period presentation.
The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, for additional
evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all money market funds and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
“Cash and cash equivalents.”
Investment Securities
Investments in debt securities designated as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if
available, or is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics. Unrealized gains and losses on the
Company’s available-for-sale debt securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of “Other comprehensive income (loss).”
Investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within “Other current
assets.” Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified within “Other current assets” if they are highly liquid in nature and represent the
investment of cash that is available for current operations.
The specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses reflected in “Interest and
other expense (income), net” in our consolidated statements of operations.
Investments in equity securities which are not accounted for under the equity method and for which there is not a readily determinable fair value are
carried at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investment
of the same issuer.
Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Accounts receivable, net of allowances,” “Accounts payable,” and “Accrued expenses and
other liabilities” approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these accounts. Our investments in U.S. treasuries, government agency securities,
and corporate bonds, if any, are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or is estimated on the basis of
quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics.
We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting
us to foreign currency risk. To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, earnings and
our foreign currency risk related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into
currency derivative contracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for
our currency derivative contracts are large and reputable commercial or investment banks.
F-9
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
We assess the nature of these derivatives under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic
815 to determine whether such derivatives should be designated as hedging instruments. The fair values of foreign currency contracts are estimated based
on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. We report the fair value of these contracts within “Other
current assets,” “Accrued expense and other liabilities,” “Other assets,” or “Other liabilities,” as applicable, in our consolidated balance sheets.
We do not hold or purchase foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
For foreign currency forward contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, we record the changes in the estimated fair
value of these derivatives within “General and administrative expenses” in our consolidated statements of operations, consistent with the nature of the
underlying transactions.
For foreign currency forward contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815, we assess the effectiveness of
these cash flow hedges at inception and on an ongoing basis and determine if the hedges are effective at providing offsetting changes in cash flows of the
hedged items. The Company records the changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and
subsequently reclassifies the related amount of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings within “General and administrative” or “Net
revenues” when the hedged item impacts earnings, consistent with the nature and timing of the underlying transactions. Cash flows from these foreign
currency forward contracts are classified in the same category as the cash flows associated with the hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash
flows. We measure hedge ineffectiveness, if any, and if it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will
discontinue hedge accounting for the derivative.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Our concentration of credit risk relates to depositors holding the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and customers with significant accounts
receivable balances.
Our cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market funds consisting of short-term, high-quality debt instruments issued by
governments and governmental organizations, financial institutions, and industrial companies.
Our customer base includes first party digital storefronts, retailers and distributors, including mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores,
discount warehouses, and game specialty stores in the U.S. and other countries worldwide. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and
maintain allowances for potential credit losses. We generally do not require collateral or other security from our customers.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Inc. (“Sony”), Apple Inc. (“Apple”), Google Inc. (“Google”), and Microsoft
Corporation (“Microsoft”) were our most significant customers with revenues of 17%, 15%, 14%, and 11%, respectively. For the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, Apple, Google, and Sony were our most significant customers with revenues of 17%, 13%, and 11%, respectively, for 2019,
and 15%, 11%, and 13%, respectively, for 2018. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in those periods.
We had two customers—Microsoft and Sony—who accounted for 28% and 21%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at December 31,
2020, and 11% and 18%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated gross receivables in those
periods.

Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses
Software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed products, as well as payments made to independent software
developers under development agreements. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such
costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design
documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the
development cycle. Software development costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is
complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Significant management
judgments and estimates are applied in assessing when capitalization commences for software development costs and the evaluation is performed on a
product-by-product basis. Prior to a product’s release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of
“Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses.” Capitalized costs for products that are canceled or are expected to
be abandoned are charged to “Product development” in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are
charged immediately to “Product development.”
Commencing upon a product’s release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization,
and intellectual property licenses” based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an
amortization period of six months to approximately two years.
Intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software,
technology, music or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights
holder, we may obtain the right to use the intellectual property in multiple products or for a single product. Prior to a product’s release, if and when we
believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual
property licenses.” Capitalized intellectual property costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to “Product
development” in the period of cancellation.
Commencing upon a product’s release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to “Cost of revenues—software royalties,
amortization, and intellectual property licenses” based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in
which the licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years and can be used in multiple products to
be released over a period beyond one year, the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond
one year.
We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products
that have been released, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be
released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the
licensed trademark or copyright is to be used. Additionally, criteria used to evaluate expected product performance may include, as appropriate: historical
performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its
release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is
based.
Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If
revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable
value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material differences may result in the
amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management’s expectations.

Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer
We apply the practical expedient to expense, as incurred, costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been
one year or less for certain similar contracts in which commissions are paid to internal personnel or third parties. We believe application of the practical
expedient has a limited effect on the amount and timing of cost recognition. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial as of December 31,
2020 and 2019.
Long-Lived Assets
Property and Equipment.    
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset (i.e., 25 to 33 years for
buildings, and 2 to 5 years for computer equipment, office furniture and other equipment). When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated
depreciation thereon are removed and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, not to exceed the length of the lease. Repair and maintenance costs are
expensed as incurred.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Assets.    
Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and is carried at cost. Acquired trade names are assessed as indefinite lived assets if there are no
foreseeable limits on the periods of time over which they are expected to contribute cash flows. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but
are subject to an annual impairment test, as well as between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. We perform our annual impairment testing at December 31.
Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our reporting units were the same
as our operating segments. We generally test goodwill for possible impairment first by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If a qualitative assessment is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is
not conclusive, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If a quantitative test is performed, we determine the fair value of the related reporting unit and
compare this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units is determined using an income
approach based on discounted cash flow models. In the event the recorded net assets of the reporting unit exceed the estimated fair value of such assets, an
impairment charge is recorded for this amount under revised accounting guidance effective for the year ended December 31, 2020, and future periods.
Refer to Note 3 for further discussion on the revised accounting guidance. Based on our annual impairment assessment, no impairments of goodwill were
identified for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
We test our acquired trade names for possible impairment by applying the same process as for goodwill. In the instance when a qualitative test is not
performed or is inconclusive, a quantitative test is performed by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value of our acquired trade names.
Based on our annual impairment assessment, no impairments of our acquired trade names were identified for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019,
and 2018.
Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates could result in future impairment charges.
Amortizable Intangible and Other Long-lived Assets.    
Intangible assets subject to amortization are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, and amortized over the estimated useful life in proportion
to the economic benefits received.
F-12
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
We evaluate the recoverability of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment exists. We consider certain events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-
lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, may not be recoverable including, but not limited to: significant changes in performance relative
to expected operating results; significant changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock
price for a sustained period of time; and changes in our business strategy. If we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate the
undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset group to determine whether an impairment exists. If an
impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset groups’ carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as
the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. We did not record an impairment charge to our definite-lived intangible
assets for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard replaced all current U.S. GAAP guidance on
this topic. On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard.
We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. In certain of our lease arrangements, primarily those related to our data
center arrangements, judgment is required in determining if a contract contains a lease. For these arrangements, there is judgment in evaluating if the
arrangement provides us with an asset that is physically distinct, or that represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset, and if we have the right to
direct the use of the asset. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term at the
commencement date. Included in the lease liability are future lease payments that are fixed, in-substance fixed, or are payments based on an index or rate
known at the commencement date of the lease. Variable lease payments are recognized as lease expenses as incurred, and generally relate to variable
payments made based on the level of services provided by the landlords of our leases. The operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) asset also includes any
lease payments made prior to the lease commencement date, initial direct costs incurred, and lease incentives received. As most of our leases do not
provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing
rate represents an approximation of the rate that would be charged to borrow funds to purchase the leased asset over a similar term, and is based on the
information available at the commencement date of the lease. For leased assets with similar lease terms and asset types, we applied a portfolio approach in
determining a single incremental borrowing rate for the leased assets.
In determining our lease liability, the lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option.
For operating leases, the lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease assets are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset, not to exceed the length of the lease, with interest expense associated with finance
lease liabilities recorded using the effective interest method. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and we
recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. For our real estate, server and data center, and event production and broadcasting
equipment leases, we elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. In all other lease
arrangements, we account for lease and non-lease components separately. Additionally, for certain leases that have a group of leased assets with similar
characteristics in size and composition, we may apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.
Operating lease ROU assets are presented in “Other assets” and operating lease liabilities are presented in “Accrued expenses and other current
liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet.
Finance lease ROU assets are presented in “Property and equipment, net” and finance lease liabilities are presented in “Accrued expenses and other
current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet.

Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard
and related amendments.
We generate revenue primarily through the sale of our interactive entertainment content and services, principally for the console, PC, and mobile
platforms, as well as through the licensing of our intellectual property. Our products span various genres, including first- and third-person action/adventure,
role-playing, strategy, and “match three.” We primarily offer the following products and services:
•premium full games, which typically provide access to main game content after purchase;
•free-to-play offerings, which allows players to download the game and engage with the associated content for free;
•in-game content for purchase to enhance gameplay (i.e. microtransactions and downloadable content) available within both our full-game and
free-to-play offerings; and
•subscriptions to players in our World of Warcraft franchise that provide ongoing access to the game content.
When control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the
consideration we expect to receive in exchange for these products and services.
We determine revenue recognition by:
•identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•identifying the performance obligations in each contract;
•determining the transaction price;
•allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in each contract; and
•recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.
Certain products are sold to customers with a “street date” (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we
recognize revenues on the later of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer. For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we
recognize revenue when it is available for download or is activated for gameplay. Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities
that are imposed at the time of the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer, such as sales and value-added taxes.
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment immediately upon purchase or
within 30 to 90 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we do not adjust the promised amount of
consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised
product or service to our customer and payment for that product or service will be one year or less.

Product Sales
Product sales consist of sales of our games, including digital full-game downloads and physical products. We recognize revenues from the sale of our
products after both (1) control of the products has been transferred to our customers and (2) the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied.
Such revenues, which include our software products with significant online functionality and our online hosted software arrangements, are recognized in
"Product sales" on our consolidated statement of operations.
Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection, which are accounted for as
variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and price protection are estimated at contract inception and updated at
the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.
Sales incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the
transaction price of our products and are reflected as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for
distinct goods or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer’s national circular advertisement, are recorded as “Sales and
marketing” expense when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of
the good or service.
Products with Online Functionality
For our software products that include both offline functionality (i.e., do not require an Internet connection to access) and significant online
functionality, such as for most of our titles from the Call of Duty franchise, we evaluate whether the license of our intellectual property and the online
functionality each represent separate and distinct performance obligations. In such instances, we typically have two performance obligations: (1) a license
to the game software that is accessible without an Internet connection (predominantly the offline single player campaign or game mode) and (2) ongoing
activities associated with the online components of the game, such as content updates, hosting of online content and gameplay, and online matchmaking
(the “online functionality”). The online functionality generally operates to support the additional features and functionalities of the game that are only
available online, not the offline license. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on, including downloadable content. When
we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual property (i.e., the offline software license) that is separate and distinct from the
online functionality, we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the standalone selling price for the performance obligations,
since we do not generally sell the software license on a standalone basis. These products may be sold in a bundle with other products and services, which
often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations.
For arrangements that include both a license to the game software that is accessible offline and separate online functionality, we recognize revenue
when control of the license transfers to our customers for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the offline software license and ratably over the
estimated service period for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the online functionality. Similarly, we defer a portion of the cost of revenues on
these arrangements and recognize the costs as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are deferred include product costs, distribution
costs, and software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses, and excludes intangible asset amortization.
Online Hosted Software Arrangements
For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all
gameplay and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player. In these instances, we typically have a single
performance obligation related to our ongoing activities in the hosted arrangement, including content updates, hosting of the gameplay, online
matchmaking, and access to the game content. Similar to our software products with online functionality, these arrangements may include other products
and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are
generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period.

In-game, Subscription, and Other Revenues
In-game Revenues
In-game revenues primarily includes revenues from microtransactions and downloadable content. Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale
of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from these sales of virtual currencies and goods are initially
recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with
a virtual currency. Proceeds from the direct sales of virtual goods are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize
our virtual goods as either “consumable” or “durable.” Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action;
accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and our performance obligation is satisfied.
Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of
durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally the
estimated service period.
Subscription Revenues
Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of Warcraft, which is only playable online and is generally sold on a subscription-
only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then
recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.
Revenues attributable to the purchase of World of Warcraft software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as “Product sales,”
whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as “In-game, subscription, and other revenues.”
Other Revenues
Other revenues primarily include revenues from software licensing and licensing of intellectual property other than software. These revenues are
recognized in "In-game, subscription, and other revenues" on our consolidated statement of operations.
In certain countries we have software licensing arrangements where we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance
with license agreements, for which the licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee and sales-based royalties. These arrangements typically
include multiple performance obligations, such as an upfront license of intellectual property and rights to specified or unspecified future updates. Our
estimate of the selling price is comprised of several factors including, but not limited to, prior selling prices, prices charged separately by other third-party
vendors for similar service offerings, and a cost-plus-margin approach. Based on the allocated transaction price, we recognize revenue associated with the
minimum guarantee (1) when we transfer control of the upfront license of intellectual property, (2) upon transfer of control of future specified updates,
and/or (3) ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the customer with unspecified future updates. Royalty payments in excess of the minimum
guarantee are generally recognized when the licensed product is sold by the licensee.
Revenues from the licensing of intellectual property other than software primarily include the licensing of our (1) brand, logo, or franchise to
customers and (2) media content. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our brand or franchise are generally recognized over the license
term. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our media content are generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which
may be upfront or over time.

Significant Judgment around Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are
considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Certain of our
games, such as titles in the Call of Duty franchise, may contain a license of our intellectual property to play the game offline, but may also depend on a
significant level of integration and interdependency with the online functionality. In these cases, significant judgment is required to determine whether this
license of our intellectual property should be considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the online
functionality provided and recognized over time. Generally, for titles in which the software license is functional without the online functionality and a
significant component of gameplay is available offline, we believe we have separate performance obligations for the license of the intellectual property and
the online functionality.
Significant judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and to determine whether
there is a discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of the various products and services. To estimate the standalone
selling price we generally consider market data, including our pricing strategies for the product being evaluated and other similar products we may offer,
competitor pricing to the extent data is available, and the replayability design of both the offline and online components of our games. In limited instances,
we may also utilize an expected cost approach to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an appropriate profit margin.
Estimated Service Period
We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number
of days between players’ first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes,
and the weighted-average number of days between players’ first purchase date and last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the
service periods of our previously released games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors’ games that are similar in
nature to ours. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our customers, as it is the best representation of the time period
during which our customers play our games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management’s judgment. Future usage
patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for
players of our current games are less than 12 months.
Principal Agent Considerations
We evaluate sales of our products and content via third-party digital storefronts, such as Microsoft’s Xbox Games Store, Sony’s PSN, the Apple App
Store, and the Google Play Store, to determine whether revenues should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. Key indicators that we
evaluate in determining whether we are the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited to:
•which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and
•which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.
Based on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via the Apple App Store and the Google
Play Store, and we report revenues on a net basis (i.e., net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsoft’s Xbox Games
Store and Sony’s PSN.

Allowances for Returns and Price Protection
We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the
circumstances in which we elect to decrease, on a short- or longer-term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and
applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our
customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things, compliance with applicable
trading and payment terms and delivery of sell-through reports to us. We may also consider the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market
factors.
Management uses judgment in estimates made with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product
revenues and when establishing the allowance for returns and price protection. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current
period product revenues utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the
end consumer, and record revenue for the transferred products in the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled.
Based upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary from our
allowance estimates and therefore impact the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if conditions change or if matters resolve in a manner that
is inconsistent with management’s assumptions utilized in determining the allowances.
Contract Balances
We generally record a receivable related to revenue when we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment, and record deferred revenue
when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, even if amounts are refundable.
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses inherent in our accounts receivable balance. In estimating the
allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer
creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our customers’ payment terms and their economic condition, as well as whether we can obtain
sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management’s estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful
accounts.
Deferred revenue is comprised primarily of unearned revenue related to the sale of products with online functionality or online hosted arrangements.
We typically invoice, and collect payment for, these sales at the beginning of the contract period and recognize revenue ratably over the estimated service
period. Deferred revenue also includes payments for: product sales pending delivery or activation; subscription revenues; licensing revenues with fixed
minimum guarantees; and other revenues for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.
Refer to Note 11 for further information, including changes in deferred revenue during the period.
Shipping and Handling
Shipping and handling costs consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges incurred to move finished goods to customers. We recognize
all shipping and handling costs as an expense in “Cost of revenues-product costs,” including those incurred when control of the product has already
transferred to the customer.

Cost of Revenues
Our cost of revenues consist of the following:
Cost of revenues—product sales:
(1)    “Product costs”—includes the manufacturing costs of goods produced and sold. These generally include product costs, manufacturing
royalties (net of volume discounts), personnel-related costs, warehousing, and distribution costs. We generally recognize volume discounts
when they are earned (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based milestones).
(2)    “Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses”—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties
attributable to product sales revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time
the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to
product sales revenues.
Cost of revenues—in-game, subscription, and other revenues:
(1)    “Game operations and distribution costs”—includes costs to operate our games, such as customer service, Internet bandwidth and server
costs, platform provider fees, and payment provider fees, along with costs to associated with our esports activities.
(2)    “Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses”—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties
attributable to in-game, subscription, and other revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are
released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase
accounting attributable to in-game, subscription, and other revenues.
Advertising Expenses
We expense advertising as incurred, except for production costs associated with media advertising, which are deferred and charged to expense when
the related advertisement is run for the first time. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $746 million, $587
million, and $631 million, respectively, and are included in “Sales and marketing” in the consolidated statements of operations.
Income Taxes
We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the provision
for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability.
For those assets that do not meet the threshold of “more likely than not” that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.
We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize
interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in “Income tax expense.”
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Reform Act”) reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and
imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Among other things, the U.S. Tax Reform Act also created a new minimum
tax that applies to certain foreign earnings (“GILTI”). We have elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as
GILTI in future years.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from share-based payments are recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of
operations. The tax effects of exercised or vested equity awards are treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur.
Foreign Currency Translation
All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries who have a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are reflected as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” in shareholders’ equity.
Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share
“Basic (loss) earnings per common share” is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. “Diluted earnings (loss) per common share” is computed by dividing income (loss) available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by the weighted-average number of common stock
equivalents. Common stock equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of our
outstanding options. However, potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings (loss) per common share calculation
when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.
Share-Based Payments
We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10. Share-based compensation expense for a given grant is recognized
over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based payment awards
after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates.
We generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions
regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and projected
employee stock option exercise behaviors.
We generally determine the fair value of restricted stock units based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of
grant, reduced by the present value of the estimated future dividends during the vesting period. Certain restricted stock units granted to our employees vest
based on the achievement of pre-established performance conditions, including those that are market-based. For performance-based restricted stock units
not subject to market conditions, each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. We
amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock units over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately
vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation
methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the
award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant incorporates into the
valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-
based restricted stock units at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the
number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.
For share-based compensation grants that are liability classified, if any, we update our grant date valuation at each reporting period and recognize a
cumulative catch-up adjustment for changes in the value related to the requisite service already rendered.

Loss Contingencies
ASC Topic 450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other claims. We record an
accrual for a potential loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate
of the potential loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better
estimate than any other amount within the range. Moreover, even if an accrual is not required, we provide additional disclosure related to litigation and
other claims when it is reasonably possible (i.e., more than remote) that the outcomes of such litigation and other claims include potential material adverse
impacts on us.
3. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
Cloud Computing Arrangements
In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance related to a customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing
arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract. The new guidance requires customers to capitalize implementation costs for these
arrangements by applying the same criteria that are utilized for existing internal-use software guidance. The capitalized costs are required to be amortized
over the associated term of the arrangement, generally on a straight-line basis, with amortization of these costs presented in the same financial statement
line item as other costs associated with the arrangement. We adopted the new standard under a prospective approach during the first quarter of 2020 and it
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill
In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if an entity forgoes a Step 0 test,
that entity will be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by (1) comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as determined in
Step 1 from the goodwill impairment test, with its carrying amount and (2) recognizing an impairment charge, if any, for the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We adopted the new standard
under a prospective approach during the first quarter of 2020 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The update replaces the existing incurred
loss impairment model with a methodology that reflects a current expected credit losses model which requires the use of historical and forward-looking
information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to
available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the
securities. These changes will generally result in earlier recognition of credit losses. We adopted the new standard under a modified retrospective basis,
with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings during the first quarter of 2020. The adoption of this standard did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes
In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance which is intended to simplify various aspects to accounting for income taxes by removing certain
exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing an intraperiod allocation and calculating
income taxes in interim periods. The amendment also clarifies and amends certain areas of existing guidance to reduce complexity and improve consistency
in the application of Topic 740. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including
adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. Generally the topics must be applied prospectively upon adoption,
with the exception of certain topics which are required to be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of
this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

2020 and 2019, respectively.
10. Fair Value Measurements
The FASB literature regarding fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of “observable inputs” and minimize the use of “unobservable
inputs.” The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
•Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and
•Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable
inputs.
Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis

11. Deferred Revenues
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of the fulfillment of our associated performance obligations. The
aggregate of the current and non-current balances of deferred revenues as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, were $1.4 billion and $1.7
billion, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the additions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to cash payments received
or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, while the reductions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to the recognition of
revenues upon fulfillment of our performance obligations, both of which were in the ordinary course of business. During the years ended December 31,
2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion of revenues, respectively, were recognized that were included
in the deferred revenues balance at the beginning of the period.
As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of contracted revenues allocated to our unsatisfied performance obligations is $2.5 billion, which
includes our deferred revenues balances and amounts to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. We expect to recognize approximately
$1.9 billion over the next 12 months, $0.4 billion in the subsequent 12-month period, and the remainder thereafter. This balance does not include an
estimate for variable consideration arising from sales-based royalty license revenue in excess of the contractual minimum guarantee or any estimated
amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint in accordance with the new revenue standard.
12. Leases
Our lease arrangements are primarily for: (1) corporate, administrative, and development studio offices; and (2) data centers and server equipment.
Our existing leases have remaining lease terms ranging from one to nine years. In certain instances, such leases include one or more options to renew, with
renewal terms that generally extend the lease term by one to five years for each option. The exercise of lease renewal options is generally at our sole
discretion. All of our existing leases are classified as operating leases.

13. Debt
Credit Facilities
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) pursuant to a credit
agreement entered into on October 11, 2013 (as amended thereafter and from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”). To date, we have not drawn on the
Revolver.
The Revolver is scheduled to mature on August 24, 2023. Borrowings under the Revolver will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (1) a
base rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for an interest period of one month beginning on such day plus 1.00%, or (2) LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable
interest margin. LIBOR will be subject to a floor of 0% and base rate will be subject to an effective floor of 1.00%.  The applicable interest margin for
borrowings under the Revolver will range from 0.875% to 1.375% for LIBOR borrowings and from 0% to 0.375% for base rate borrowings and will be
determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company’s credit ratings. Up to $50 million of the Revolver may be used for letters of credit.
Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to a financial covenant requiring the Company’s Consolidated Total Net
Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed 3.75:1.00 (or, at the Company’s option and for a limited period of time upon the
consummation of a Qualifying Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement), 4.25:1.00. The Credit Agreement contains covenants customary for
transactions of this type for issuer with similar credit ratings. These include those restricting liens, debt of non-guarantor subsidiaries and certain
fundamental changes, in each case with exceptions, including exceptions for secured debt and debt of non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Company, in each
case up to an amount not exceeding 7.5% of Total Assets (as defined in the Credit Agreement). We were in compliance with the terms of the Credit
Agreement as of December 31, 2020.

Total net carrying amount $ 3,605 $ 2,675 
On August 5, 2020, we issued the 2030 Notes and 2050 Notes in a public underwritten offering, for an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion in
new debt. In connection with the issuance, we incurred approximately $26 million of debt discount and financing costs that were capitalized and recorded
within “Long-term debt, net” in our consolidated balance sheet.
On September 4, 2020, we redeemed all of our outstanding 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of their respective
principal amounts plus (1) a “make-whole” premium of $28 million and (2) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The redemption of the 2021
Notes and 2022 Notes resulted in a “Loss on extinguishment of debt” recorded in the consolidated statement of operations of $31 million.
We may redeem some or all of each class of the unsecured senior notes. Any such redemption will be at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest as well as, for a redemption prior to the permitted redemption date for that class of notes, a
“make-whole” premium.
Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes outstanding at a purchase price equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These repurchase requirements are considered clearly and closely related to the
unsecured notes and are not accounted for separately upon issuance.
The outstanding notes are general senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and
future senior indebtedness, including the Revolver described above. The notes are not secured and are effectively junior to any of the Company’s existing
and future indebtedness that is secured to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes contain customary covenants that
place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of secured debt, entry into sale or leaseback transactions, and certain
merger or consolidation transactions. We were in compliance with the terms of the notes outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we have no contractual principal repayments of our long-term debt within the next five years.

15. Operating Segments and Geographic Regions
We have three reportable segments—Activision, Blizzard, and King. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations
are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The CODM reviews segment
performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games;
share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees,
expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings; certain restructuring and related costs; and certain other
non-cash charges. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is
made with respect thereto.
Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal organizational structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources,
and the availability of separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments.

16. Share-Based Payments
Activision Blizzard Equity Incentive Plans
On June 5, 2014, the Activision Blizzard, Inc. 2014 Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) became effective. Under the 2014 Plan, the Compensation
Committee of our Board of Directors is authorized to provide share-based compensation in the form of stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and other performance- or value-based awards structured by the Compensation Committee within
parameters set forth in the 2014 Plan. As of the effective date of the 2014 Plan, we had ceased making awards under our prior equity incentive plans
(collectively, the “Prior Plans”), although such plans remain in effect to the extent that they continue to govern outstanding awards.
While the Compensation Committee has broad discretion to create equity incentives, our current share-based compensation program generally
utilizes a combination of options and restricted stock units. The majority of our options have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting annually over
a period of three years to five years, and expire 10 years from the grant date. In addition, under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the exercise price for the options
must be equal to or greater than the closing price per share of our common stock on the date the award is granted, as reported on Nasdaq. Restricted stock
units have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting in their entirety on an anniversary of the date of grant, or vest annually over a period of three
years to five years, and may also be contingent on the achievement of specified performance measures, including those which are market-based.
Achievement against such performance measures typically results in vesting of amounts that are different than the target shares at grant based on over- or
under-achievement against the performance targets. Typically, performance-based RSU’s provide for vesting up to 125% of the grant date target shares if
performance targets are sufficiently overachieved (and will be cancelled without the vesting of any shares if the threshold level of performance measures is
not met), but in certain instances performance-based RSU’s can vest up to 500% of the grant date target amount based on achievement against the
performance targets.
As of the date it was approved by our shareholders, there were 46 million shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. The number of shares of
our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan has been, and may be further, increased from time to time by: (1) the number of shares
relating to awards outstanding under any Prior Plan that: (i) expire, or are forfeited, terminated or canceled, without the issuance of shares; (ii) are settled in
cash in lieu of shares; or (iii) are exchanged, prior to the issuance of shares of our common stock, for awards not involving our common stock; (2) if the
exercise price of any option outstanding under any Prior Plans is, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award outstanding under any
Prior Plans are, satisfied by withholding shares otherwise then deliverable in respect of the award or the actual or constructive transfer to the Company of
shares already owned, the number of shares equal to the withheld or transferred shares; and (3) if a share appreciation right is exercised and settled in
shares, a number of shares equal to the difference between the total number of shares with respect to which the award is exercised and the number of shares
actually issued or transferred. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 20 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under
the 2014 Plan. Shares issued in connection with awards made under the 2014 Plan are generally issued as new stock issuances.
Fair Value Valuation Assumptions
Valuation of Stock Options
The fair value of stock options granted are principally estimated using a binomial-lattice model. The inputs in our binomial-lattice model include
expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as measures of employees’
cancellations, exercise, and post-vesting termination behavior. Statistical methods are used to estimate employee termination rates.
F-40
Table of Contents
ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions, weighted average grant date fair value, and the range of expected stock price
volatility:
 Employee Stock Options
 For the Years Ended December 31,
 2020 2019 2018
Expected life (in years) 7.70 7.85 7.64
Volatility 30.89 % 30.00 % 32.37 %
Risk free interest rate 0.70 % 1.90 % 3.10 %
Dividend yield 0.53 % 0.76 % 0.61 %
Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 25.93 $ 17.12 $ 21.03 
Stock price volatility range:
Low 30.00 % 30.00 % 31.72 %
High 39.00 % 38.17 % 36.73 %
Expected life
The expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of the binomial-lattice model and represents the weighted-average period the stock
options are expected to remain outstanding. A binomial-lattice model assumes that employees will exercise their options when the stock price equals or
exceeds an exercise multiple. The exercise multiple is based on historical employee exercise behaviors.
Volatility
To estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we consider the implied volatility of exchange-traded options on our stock to estimate short-
term volatility, the historical volatility of our common shares during the option’s contractual term to estimate long-term volatility, and a statistical model to
estimate the transition from short-term volatility to long-term volatility.
Risk-free interest rate
As is the case for volatility, the risk-free interest rate is assumed to change during the option’s contractual term. The risk-free interest rate, which is
based on U.S. Treasury yield curves, reflects the expected movement in the interest rate from one time period to the next.
Dividend yield
The expected dividend yield assumption is based on our historical and expected future amount of dividend payouts.
Share-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and therefore has been reduced for estimated
forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates.

ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Valuation of Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)
The fair value of the Company’s RSU awards granted are generally based upon the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant reduced
by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. We also grant market-based RSU awards, from time to time,
whose fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Such market-based RSU awards include performance conditions based on our own stock
price, and may also include performance conditions that compare our stock price performance to an index, such as the S&P 500 Total Shareholder Return
index. The Monte Carlo model simulates performance of our stock, as well as any applicable stock index performance, over the performance measurement
period to determine the performance payout, with the resulting achievement discounted back to the valuation date, at the risk-free rate, to arrive at the fair
value of the awards. Additionally, the Monte Carlo simulation provides an output of the service period to achieve the market condition in instances where
such market condition can impact the vesting date of the market-based RSU. The valuation assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo model are generally
consistent with those discussed in the valuation of stock options above. The weighted average risk free interest rate, volatility, and dividend yield utilized in
the Monte Carlo model for market-based RSU awards in 2020 were 0.11%, 37.39%, and 0.47%, respectively.
Accuracy of Fair Value Estimates
We developed the assumptions used in the models above, including measures of employees’ exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. Our
ability to accurately estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards at the grant date depends upon the accuracy of the model and our ability to
accurately forecast model inputs for as long as 10 years into the future. These inputs include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility, risk-free
rate, dividend yield, and employee termination rates. Although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option-pricing model, the
estimates that are produced by this model may not be indicative of the fair value observed between a willing buyer and a willing seller as there are not
current active markets for the trading of employee stock options and other share-based instruments.

Exercisable at December 31, 2020 3,710 $ 41.56 5.75$ 190 
The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between our closing stock price on the
last trading day of the period and the exercise price, times the number of shares for options where the closing stock price is greater than the exercise price)
that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on that date. This amount changes based on the market
value of our stock. The total intrinsic value of options actually exercised was $174 million, $80 million, and $196 million for the years ended December 31,
2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The total grant date fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was
$62 million, $94 million, and $45 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2020, $66 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-
average period of 1.25 years.

RSU Activity
We grant RSUs, which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock. Vesting for RSUs is contingent upon the holders’ continued
employment with us and may be subject to other conditions (which may include the satisfaction of a performance measure). Also, certain of our
performance-based RSUs, including those that are market-based, include a range of shares that may be released at vesting which are above or below the
targeted number of RSUs based on actual performance relative to the performance measure. If the vesting conditions are not met, unvested RSUs will be
forfeited. Upon vesting of the RSUs, we may withhold shares otherwise deliverable to satisfy tax withholding requirements.
The following table summarizes our RSU activity with performance-based RSUs, including those with market conditions, presented at 100% of the
target level shares that may potentially vest (amounts in thousands, except per share data):
 Number of sharesWeighted-
average grant

Forfeited (820) 55.39 
Unvested RSUs at December 31, 2020 7,102 $ 82.50 
Certain of our performance-based RSUs did not have an accounting grant date as of December 31, 2020, as there is not a mutual understanding
between the Company and the employee of the performance terms. Generally, these performance terms relate to operating income performance for future
years where the performance goals have not yet been set. As of December 31, 2020, based on the target potential shares that could be earned, there were 2.4
million performance-based RSUs outstanding for which the accounting grant date had not been set, of which 1.4 million were 2020 grants. Accordingly, no
grant date fair value was established and the weighted average grant date fair values calculated above excludes these RSUs.
At December 31, 2020, approximately $170 million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to RSUs and is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 0.75 years. Of the total unrecognized compensation cost, $154 million was related to performance-based RSUs, which is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.75 years. The total grant date fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $82 million, $147 million, and $120 million, respectively.
The income tax benefit from stock option exercises and RSU vestings was $61 million, $47 million, and $94 million for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

17. Restructuring
During 2019, we began implementing a plan aimed at refocusing our resources on our largest opportunities and removing unnecessary levels of
complexity from certain parts of our business. We have been:
•increasing our investment in development for our largest, internally-owned franchises—across upfront releases, in-game content, mobile, and
geographic expansion;
•reducing certain non-development and administrative-related costs across our business; and
•integrating our global and regional sales and “go-to-market,” partnerships, and sponsorships capabilities across the business, which we
believe will enable us to provide better opportunities for talent, and greater expertise and scale on behalf of our business units.
Since initial implementation in 2019, we have expanded the scope of certain actions within our plan that are aimed at integrating our global and
regional functions to allow continued focus on investing in our largest, internally-owned franchises and to provide us with the ability to better leverage our
scale across the organization. The restructuring actions remain in progress as we continue to focus on these goals and will continue into 2021.

(1)Includes charges for operating segments managed outside the reportable segments and our corporate and administrative functions.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred additional restructuring charges that are not included in the plan discussed above. Such
amounts were not material.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we also recorded $5 million to write-down inventory as a result of changes to certain of our consumer
product activities as part of our restructuring actions, whereby those activities will now operate under a licensing business model rather than being direct
sales. This write-down is recorded within “Cost of revenues—product sales: Product costs” in our consolidated statement of operations.
We expect to incur total aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $310 million associated with the plan, of which the remaining
charges that have not yet been incurred are expected to largely be incurred within the next 12 months. The charges associated with the plan are expected to
relate to severance and employee-related costs (approximately 60% of the aggregate charge), facilities and related costs (approximately 20% of the
aggregate charge), and other costs (approximately 20% of the aggregate charge), including charges for restructuring related fees and the write-down of
assets. A substantial majority (approximately 70%) of the total pre-tax charge associated with the restructuring is expected to be paid in cash using amounts
on hand, and such cash outlays are largely expected to be completed by the end of 2021. We do not expect to realize significant net savings in our total
operating expenses as a result of our plan, as cost reductions in our selling, general and administrative activities is expected to be offset by increased
investment in product development.

In October 2019, we completed an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights to one of our subsidiaries in the U.K., aligning the
ownership of these rights with our evolving business. The transfer did not result in a taxable gain; however, our U.K. subsidiary received a step-up in tax
basis based on the fair value of the transferred intellectual property rights. Such fair value was determined based on our expectations of future cash flows,
long-term growth rates, and discount rates. We recorded a one-time benefit of $230 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 for the recognition of a
$1.1 billion deferred tax asset in the U.K. related to the amortizable tax basis in the transferred intellectual property, net of uncertain tax positions and a
valuation allowance, partially offset by a related $920 million deferred tax liability for U.S. taxes on foreign earnings. The U.K. amortizable tax basis will
be recovered over a period of three years to 25 years and the related deferred tax asset was measured using the enacted U.K. corporate tax rates for the
years in which the amortization will be realized. We recorded a valuation allowance of $110 million in 2019 for the portion of the deferred tax asset for
which it is more-likely-than-not that a benefit will not be realized. We will update the measurement and realizability analysis going forward and record the
impact from any change in determination in the period of the change.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights to the U.S. to better align the
profits related to these rights with our evolving business activities. As a result, a significant portion of these earnings began qualifying for preferential
treatment as foreign-derived intangible income during 2020. The transfer resulted in a one-time benefit of $31 million in connection with the
remeasurement of a U.S. deferred tax asset related to foreign earnings.
On June 27, 2018, we entered into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to resolve certain intercompany transfer pricing
arrangements for tax periods starting in 2009 (the “Closing Agreement”). The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement were recognized in the
second quarter of 2018 and consisted of a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million. In addition, we
recognized $185 million of tax benefits related to other tax adjustments resulting from the changes in U.S. tax attributes and taxable income caused by the
primary adjustments. The Closing Agreement resulted in federal and state cash tax payments totaling approximately $345 million, of which federal tax
payments of $334 million were made in October 2018.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax
rate from 35% to 21%, beginning in 2018, and implemented the Transition Tax. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis of the effect of the
U.S. Tax Reform Act and recorded a net tax benefit of $340 million. This is primarily related to adoption of GILTI deferred tax accounting and
remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities partially offset by tax expense related to Transition Tax.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and
the amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows (amounts in millions):
 As of December 31,
 2020 2019
Deferred tax assets:   
Deferred revenue $ 274 $ 119 
Tax attributes carryforwards 123 93 
Share-based compensation 51 54 
Intangibles 1,287 1,289 
Capitalized software development expenses 21 67 
Other 160 156 
Deferred tax assets 1,916 1,778 
Valuation allowance (228) (181)
Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 1,688 1,597 
Deferred tax liabilities:  
Intangibles (147) (142)
U.S. deferred taxes on foreign earnings (577) (594)
Other (63) (73)
Deferred tax liabilities (787) (809)
Net deferred tax assets $ 901 $ 788 
As of December 31, 2020, we had gross tax credit carryforwards of $227 million for state purposes. The tax credit carryforwards are included in
deferred tax assets net of unrealized tax benefits that would apply upon the realization of uncertain tax positions. In addition, we had foreign net operating
loss carryforwards of $46 million at December 31, 2020, most of which carry forward indefinitely.
We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. We record a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the threshold of “more
likely than not” to be realized in the future. To make that determination, we evaluate the likelihood of realization based on the weight of all positive and
negative evidence available. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we maintained a valuation allowance related to our California research and
development credit carryforwards of $107 million and $71 million, respectively. We will reassess this determination quarterly and record a tax benefit if
and when future evidence allows for a partial or full release of this valuation allowance.
In addition, we remeasured the U.K. deferred tax asset related to previously transferred intellectual property rights and corresponding U.S. deferred tax
liability due to the change in the U.K.'s corporate income tax rate during 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the U.K. deferred tax asset net of valuation
allowance is $1.1 billion and the corresponding U.S. deferred tax liability is $881 million.
Activision Blizzard’s tax years after 2008 remain open to examination by certain major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. The Internal
Revenue Service is currently examining our federal tax returns for the 2012 through 2016 tax years. We also have several state and non-U.S. audits
pending. In addition, King’s pre-acquisition tax returns remain open in various jurisdictions, primarily as a result of transfer pricing matters. We anticipate
resolving King’s transfer pricing for both pre- and post-acquisition tax years through a collaborative multilateral process with the tax authorities in the
relevant jurisdictions, which include the U.K. and Sweden. While the outcome of this process remains uncertain, it could result in an agreement that
changes the allocation of profits and losses between these and other relevant jurisdictions or a failure to reach an agreement that results in unilateral
adjustments to the amount and timing of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which King operates.

In December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the French Tax Authority (the “FTA”) related to transfer pricing for intercompany
transactions involving one of our French subsidiaries for the 2011 through 2013 tax years. The total assessment, including penalties and interest, was
approximately €571 million (approximately $638 million). In December 2019, the Company reached a settlement with the FTA for the 2011 through 2018
tax years, resulting in the recognition of $54 million of tax expense in the period ended December 31, 2019 and a tax payment of €161 million
(approximately $179 million), including interest and penalties, in January 2020.
In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation, or may be subject to examination or investigation, by tax authorities in
various jurisdictions. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions. Such
proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in the earlier of the
period or periods in which the matters are resolved and in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into account in our financial statements. If we were to
receive a materially adverse assessment from a taxing jurisdiction, we would plan to vigorously contest it and consider all of our options, including the
pursuit of judicial remedies.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.2 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $706 million of which would affect our effective tax rate, if
recognized. A reconciliation of total gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (amounts in millions):
 For the Years Ended December 31,
 2020 2019 2018
Unrecognized tax benefits balance at January 1 $ 1,037 $ 926 $ 1,138 
Gross increase for tax positions taken during a prior year 97 151 103 
Gross decrease for tax positions taken during a prior year (1) (168) (123)
Gross increase for tax positions taken during the current year 38 291 132 
Settlement with taxing authorities (3) (163) (312)
Lapse of statute of limitations (2) — (12)
Unrecognized tax benefits balance at December 31 $ 1,166 $ 1,037 $ 926 
As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had approximately $93 million, $72 million, and $87 million, respectively, of accrued interest and
penalties related to uncertain tax positions. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recorded $19 million, $14 million, and $11
million, respectively, of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions.
The final resolution of the Company’s global tax disputes is uncertain. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of disputes, including the
probability determination and estimation of the potential exposure. Based on current information, in the opinion of the Company’s management, the
ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results
of operations, except as noted above.

22. Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments and Obligations
In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our
offices, for the development of products which may include obtaining rights to intellectual property, and for hosting services to support our games and our
administrative functions. Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor, developer, or hosting provider, as the case may be,
based upon contractual arrangements. The payments to third-party developers are generally conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of
contractually specified development milestones. Further, these payments to third-party developers typically are deemed to be advances and, as such, are
recoupable against future royalties earned by the developer based on sales of the related game. Additionally, we also enter into arrangements in which we
commit to spend specified amounts for marketing to support and promote our content and services. Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total
future minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in place at December 31, 2020, are scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in
millions):

(1)We have omitted uncertain income tax liabilities from this table due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of the potential issue resolution of
the underlying matters. Specifically, either (a) the underlying positions have not been fully developed under audit to quantify at this time or (b) the
years relating to the matters for certain jurisdictions are not currently under audit. At December 31, 2020, we had $466 million of net unrecognized tax
benefits included in “Other liabilities,” in our consolidated balance sheet.
Additionally, at December 31, 2020, we have a remaining net Transition Tax liability of $153 million associated with the U.S. Tax Reform Act. The
remaining Transition Tax liability is payable over the next six years and is not reflected in our Contractual Obligations table above.
(2)Long-term debt obligations represent our obligations related to the contractual principal repayments and interest payments for our outstanding
unsecured notes, which are subject to fixed interest rates, as of December 31, 2020. There was no outstanding balance under our Revolver as of
December 31, 2020. We have calculated the expected interest obligation based on the outstanding principal balance and interest rate applicable at
December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on our debt obligations.

Legal Proceedings
We are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to
intellectual property, competition and antitrust matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, privacy matters, labor and employment matters, compliance matters,
unclaimed property matters, liability and personal injury claims, product damage claims, collection matters, and/or commercial claims. In the opinion of
management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we do not expect them to have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
Letters of Credit
As described in Note 13, a portion of our Revolver can be used to issue letters of credit of up to $50 million, subject to the availability of the
Revolver. At December 31, 2020, we did not have any letters of credit issued or outstanding under the Revolver.

5. Tax W ithholding .
(xii)Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any W ithholding T axes related to the
Holder ’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Holder , the Holder acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all
Withholding T axes is and remains the Holder ’s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any , actually withheld by the
Company or the Employer . The Holder further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (A) make no representations
or undertakings regarding the treatment of any W ithholding T axes in connection with any aspect of the Stock Option, including,
without limitation, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Stock Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such
exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (B) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant
or any aspect of the Stock Option to reduce or eliminate the Holder ’s liability for W ithholding T axes or achieve any particular tax
result. Further , if the Holder is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Holder acknowledges that the
Company and/or the Employer (or former employer , as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for W ithholding
Taxes in more than one jurisdiction. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver any Shares upon exercise of the Stock
Option unless and until all W ithholding T axes contemplated by this Section 5 have been satisfied.
(xiii)Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Holder agrees to make adequate
arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all W ithholding T axes resulting from the exercise (in
whole or in part) of the Stock Option, the issuance or transfer of any Shares upon exercise of the Stock Option or otherwise in
connection with the A ward at the time such W ithholding T axes become due. In this regard, the Holder authorizes the Company
and/or the Employer , or their respective agents, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all W ithholding
Taxes by one or a combination of the following: (i) by delivery to the Company of a bank check or certified check or wire
transfer of immediately available funds; (ii) if securities of the Company of the same class as the Shares are then traded or quoted
on a national securities exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or a national quotation system sponsored by the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through the delivery of irrevocable written instructions, in a form acceptable to the
Company , to the Equity Account Administrator (or , with the Company’ s consent, such other
    A-5
Global Online Option Grant Award Agreement (as of December 2020)
brokerage firm as may be requested by the person exercising the Stock Option) to sell some or all of the Shares being purchased
upon such exercise and to thereafter deliver promptly to the Company from the proceeds of such sale an amount in cash equal to
the aggregate amount of such W ithholding T axes; (iii) through the withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise; or
(iv) by any combination of (i), (ii) or (iii) above. Further , any entity in the Company Group shall have the right to require the
Holder to satisfy any W ithholding T axes contemplated by this Section 5 by any of the aforementioned methods or by withholding
from the Holder ’s wages or other cash compensation.
(xiv)The Company Group may withhold or account for W ithholding T axes contemplated by this Section 5 by reference
to applicable withholding rates, including minimum or maximum applicable statutory rates in the Holder ’s jurisdiction(s) of
employment and/or residency , and if the Company Group withholds more than the amount necessary to satisfy the liability , the
Holder may receive a refund of any over -withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent Shares. If the
Company Group withholds less than the amount necessary to satisfy the liability , the Holder may be required to pay any
additional W ithholding T axes directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Employer . If the obligation for
Withholding T axes is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Holder will be deemed to have been issued the full
number of Shares, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the W ithholding
Taxes. No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the exercise of the Stock Option and the issuance of

This Appendix includes special terms and conditions applicable to Holders who work and/or reside in the countries covered by
the Appendix. These terms and conditions are in addition to or , if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in

If the Holder is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working,

to what extent the special terms and conditions shall apply to the Holder .
NOTIFICA TIONS
This Appendix also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which the Holder should be aware with
respect to his or her participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities and other laws in ef fect
in the countries to which this Appendix refers as of October 2020. Such laws are often complex and change frequently . As a
result, the Company strongly recommends that the Holder not rely on the notifications herein as the only source of information
relating to the consequences of participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time Shares are
purchased upon exercise of the Stock Option or Shares purchased under the Plan are sold.
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to the particular situation of the Holder , and the Company is
not in a position to assure the Holder of any particular result. Accordingly , each Holder should seek appropriate professional
advice as to how the relevant laws in his or her country may apply to his or her situation. Finally , if the Holder is a mobile
employee, the information contained herein may not be applicable to the Holder in the same manner .

connection with such transfer; and provided , further  that Grantee will remain bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the
Grant Notice and these A ward T erms. Except as otherwise permitted under the Plan or this Section 12, the Restricted Share Units

likely result in the imposition on Grantee or any other person of taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee
may, in its sole discretion, modify the terms of the Plan, the Grant Notice or these A ward T erms, without the consent of Grantee,
in the manner that the Committee may reasonably and in good faith determine to be necessary or advisable to avoid the
imposition of such taxes, interest or penalties; provided , however , that this Section 14 does not create an obligation on the part of

gross up in connection with any taxes, interest or penalties owed by Grantee pursuant to Section 409A.

ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS by country
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan or the Award Terms, as the
case may be.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
This Appendix includes special terms and conditions applicable to Grantees who work and/or reside in the countries covered by
the Appendix. These terms and conditions are in addition to or , if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in
the A ward T erms.
If Grantee is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working,
transferred or transfers employment and/or residency after the Restricted Share Units were granted or is considered a resident of
another country for local law purposes ( i.e., Grantee is a “mobile employee”), the Company shall have the sole discretion to
determine to what extent the special terms and conditions shall apply to Grantee.
NOTIFICA TIONS
This Appendix also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which Grantee should be aware with
respect to his or her participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities and other laws in ef fect
in the countries to which this Appendix refers as of October 2020. Such laws are often complex and change frequently . As a
result, the Company strongly recommends that Grantee not rely on the notifications herein as the only source of information
relating to the consequences of participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time Grantee vests in
the Restricted Share Units or V ested Shares acquired under the Plan are sold.
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to the particular situation of Grantee, and the Company is
not in a position to assure Grantee of any particular result. Accordingly , Grantee should seek appropriate professional advice as to
how the relevant laws in his or her country may apply to his or her situation. Finally , if Grantee is a mobile employee, the
information contained herein may not be applicable to Grantee in the same manner .

such Employment V iolation, including, without limitation, the right to terminate Grantee’ s employment if not already terminated
