Amcor reports fiscal 2023 results and provides outlook for fiscal 2024
June 2023 quarter:
GAAP diluted EPS of 12.3 cps; Adjusted EPS of 19.3 cps
Fiscal 2023 Full Year Highlights 
• Net sales of $14,694 million, in line with the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis;
• GAAP Net Income of $1,048 million;  GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 70.5 cps;
• Adjusted EPS of 73.3 cps and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $848 million, in line with guidance provided in
May.  Adjusted EBIT of $1,608 million;
• Strong total cash returns to shareholders of $1.2 billion: annual dividend increased to 49.0 cents per
share; $431 million of shares repurchased (approximately 3% of outstanding shares); and
• Fiscal 2024 outlook: Adjusted EPS of 67-71 cents per share.  Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $850-950
million.
Amcor CEO Ron Delia said: “Throughout fiscal 2023, our teams did an excellent job proactively recovering 
inflation and reducing costs in a highly challenging environment.  Adjusted EBIT grew modestly in comparable 
constant currency terms and we returned $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders. After delivering earnings growth 
of 8% in the first half, demand softened considerably and customer destocking persisted through the last two 
quarters of the year. 
While we expect current market conditions to continue in the near-term, we have visibility to a number of 
controllable factors we believe will support a return to solid earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 2024 and 
leave us well placed to grow at our long term trend of high-single digit rates thereafter.  We are pricing to 
compensate for inflation and we expect benefits from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will have a 
favorable and sustainable impact on operating leverage. In addition, we expect the headwinds from the sale of 
our Russian plants and higher interest expense will be largely limited to the first half.  
We remain focused on our long-term growth strategy and will continue to pursue opportunities to invest in the 
business, particularly through innovation and sustainability initiatives in faster growing, higher value markets. 
We will also continue pursuing value-creating M&A and returning cash to shareholders through share 
repurchases and a compelling and growing dividend.”

Cash Returns to Shareholders
Amcor generates significant annual cash flow, maintains strong credit metrics, and is committed to an investment 
grade credit rating. The Company's strong annual cash flow and balance sheet provide substantial capacity to reinvest 
in the business for organic growth, pursue acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through a compelling and 
growing dividend as well as regular share repurchases.
During fiscal 2023, the Company returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders through cash dividends and share 
repurchases in addition to completing three bolt-on acquisitions.
Dividend
The Amcor Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12.25 cents per share (compared with 12.0 
cents per share in the same quarter last year).  Combined with the last three quarterly dividends, this increases the 
annual dividend for fiscal 2023 to 49.0 cents per share.  The quarterly dividend declared today will be paid in US 
dollars to holders of Amcor’s ordinary shares trading on the NYSE.  Holders of CDIs trading on the ASX will receive an 
unfranked dividend of 18.77 Australian cents per share, which reflects the quarterly dividend of 12.25 cents per share 
converted at an average AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.6526 over the five trading days ended August 14, 2023.
The ex-dividend date will be September 6, 2023, the record date will be September 7, 2023, and the payment date will 
be September 27, 2023.  
Share repurchases 
Amcor repurchased approximately 41 million shares (approximately 3% of total shares issued and outstanding) during 
fiscal 2023 for a total cost of $431 million.
Amcor expects to allocate approximately $70 million of cash towards share repurchases in fiscal 2024, as part of the 
program previously announced in fiscal 2023.

Twelve months ended June 30, 2023
Net sales for the Amcor Group increased by 1% on a reported basis, which includes an unfavorable impact of 
approximately 3% related to movements in foreign exchange rates, an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% related 
to items affecting comparability, and price increases of approximately $775 million (representing 5% growth) related to 
the pass through of higher raw material costs.
Net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were in line with the prior year, largely reflecting price/mix benefits 
of approximately 3%.  Full year volumes were approximately 3% lower than last year. 
GAAP Net Income was $1,048 million and includes a $215 million gain on the sale of Amcor's business in Russia on 
December 23, 2022.  Adjusted EBIT of $1,608 million was 1% higher than last year on a comparable constant currency 
basis.  Adjusted EBIT margin of 10.9% includes an adverse impact of approximately 90 basis points related to 
increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.

June 2023 quarter
Net sales for the Amcor Group of $3,673 million were 6% lower than last year on a reported basis.  This includes an 
unfavorable impact of approximately 2% related to items affecting comparability and price increases of approximately 
$25 million (representing 1% growth) related to the pass through of higher raw material costs.  Movements in foreign 
exchange rates had no material impact on net sales for the quarter.
Net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were approximately 5% lower than the same period last year. 
Volumes were approximately 7% lower than last year.  This was partly offset by price/mix benefits of approximately 
2%.

Net sales of $11,154 million were in line with last year on a reported basis, including an unfavorable impact of 
approximately 4% related to movements in foreign exchange rates, an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% related 
to items affecting comparability, and price increases of approximately $515 million (representing 5% growth) related to 
the pass through of higher raw material costs.  On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were 
approximately 1% higher than last year reflecting price/mix benefits of 4%, partly offset by approximately 3% lower 
volumes.
In North America, net sales were marginally lower than the prior year driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/
mix benefits. Volumes were higher in the healthcare, pet care, cheese, and home and personal care categories, and 
this was more than offset by lower volumes in categories including condiments, meat, and ready meals. 
In Europe, net sales grew in the low single digit range driven by price/mix benefits, partly offset by lower volumes. 
Volumes were lower in the coffee, home and personal care, yogurt and confectionary categories. This was partly offset 
by higher volumes in the pet care and pharmaceutical categories. 
Net sales were in line with the prior year across the Asia Pacific region, with price/mix benefits offset by lower volumes. 
Volumes were lower in China where demand was unfavorably impacted by COVID-19 related lockdowns.  Sales 
growth  remained strong in India, Australia, and the pan-Asian healthcare and meat end markets.  In Latin America, net 
sales declined in the low single digit range driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits.  
Adjusted EBIT of $1,429 million was 1% higher than in the prior period on a comparable constant currency basis, 
reflecting favorable operating cost performance, partly offset by the impact of lower volumes and unfavorable mix 
trends.
Adjusted EBIT margin of 12.8% includes an adverse impact of approximately 100 basis points related to the increased 
sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.
June 2023 quarter
Net sales of $2,777 million were 6% lower than last year on a reported basis, including a favorable impact of 
approximately 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates, an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% related 
to items affecting comparability, and price increases of approximately $25 million (representing 1% growth) related to 
the pass through of higher raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 
5% lower than last year reflecting approximately 7% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of 2%.

Volume weakness was broad based with high single digit declines across the European and North American markets, 
and a mid single digit decline in Latin America.  The volume decline in these regions reflects soft consumer demand as 
well as customer destocking.  In Asia, overall volumes were in line with the same quarter last year.  
Adjusted EBIT of $387 million was lower than the same quarter last year on a comparable constant currency basis, 
reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost 
inflation.  These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives.

Net sales of $3,540 million were 4% higher than last year on a reported basis, including an unfavorable impact of 
approximately 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates and price increases of approximately $260 million 
(representing 8% growth) related to the pass through of higher raw material costs.  On a comparable constant currency 
basis, net sales were approximately 3% lower than last year, reflecting price/mix benefits of approximately 1% offset by 
approximately 4% lower volumes. 
In North America, overall beverage volumes were 6% lower than last year. Hot fill beverage container volumes were in 
line with the prior year as new business wins in key categories offset unfavorable consumer demand and customer 
destocking.  Combined preform and cold fill container volumes were lower than the prior year. Overall specialty 
container volumes were lower than the prior year with growth in the healthcare, dairy and nutrition categories offset by 
weaker volumes in the food and home and personal care categories.
In Latin America, volumes declined at low single digit rates which reflects challenging economic conditions across the 
region.  
Adjusted EBIT of $265 million was lower than the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower 
volumes and unfavorable mix trends, partly offset by favorable operating cost performance.
Adjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% includes an adverse impact of approximately 80 basis points related to the increased 
sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.  
June 2023 quarter
Net sales of $897 million were 5% lower than the same quarter last year on a reported basis including an unfavorable 
impact of 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales 
were 4% lower than last year reflecting approximately 6% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of 
approximately 2%. 
In North America, overall beverage volumes were 8% lower than the same quarter last year as a result of lower 
consumer demand and customer destocking more than offsetting new business wins.  June 2023 quarter hot fill 
beverage container volumes were 6% lower than last year, broadly in line with the market.  
Adjusted EBIT of $73 million was lower than the same quarter last year on a comparable constant currency basis, 
reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost 
inflation.  These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives. 
Net interest and income tax expense
For the year ended June 30, 2023, net interest expense of $259 million was $124 million higher than the same period 
last year, reflecting higher interest rates.  GAAP income tax expense was $193 million compared with $300 million last 
year.  Excluding amounts related to non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2023 
was $250 million compared with $332 million in the prior year.  Adjusted tax expense represents an effective tax rate of 
18.5% which is lower than 21.2% last year, primarily due to differences in the mix of taxable income and discrete items 
in both periods.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow
Adjusted Free Cash Flow for fiscal 2023 was $848 million and compares with $1,066 million last year.  The year over 
year variance largely reflects higher interest payments and lower accounts payable balances resulting from moderated 
purchasing activities due to lower demand and inventory reduction initiatives.  June 2023 quarter Adjusted Free Cash 
Flow of $834 million compares with $803 million in the same quarter last year.  
Net debt was $6,057 million at June 30, 2023.  Leverage, measured as net debt divided by adjusted trailing twelve 
month EBITDA, was 3.0 times and in line with the Company's expectations. 
Fiscal 2024 Guidance 
For the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2024, the Company expects: 
• Adjusted EPS of 67 to 71 cents per share which includes:
• Comparable constant currency earnings which includes underlying business performance down low single
digit % to up low single digit %, a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases, and a negative
impact of approximately 6% related to higher estimated net interest and tax expense;
• A negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of the Company's three plants in Russia on
December 23, 2022; and
• A benefit of approximately 2% related to currency translation, assuming current rates prevail through the
balance of fiscal 2024.
• The Company expects adjusted EPS on a reported basis in the first half of fiscal 2024 to be down in the
mid-teens % compared with the first half of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower volumes and the residual
headwinds related to the sale of the Russia plants and higher interest expense. In the second half of fiscal
2024, adjusted EPS is expected to be up mid-single digits % compared with the second half of fiscal 2023,
benefiting in-part from structural cost saving initiatives and increased earnings leverage resulting from
price and cost actions taken in fiscal 2023 and 2024.
• Adjusted Free Cash Flow of approximately $850 million to $950 million, representing solid growth over fiscal
2023. 
•Approximately $70 million of cash to be allocated towards share repurchases as part of the program previously
announced in fiscal 2023.
Amcor's guidance contemplates a range of factors which create a degree of uncertainty and additional complexity 
when estimating future financial results. Further information can be found under 'Cautionary Statement Regarding 
Forward-Looking Statements' in this release.

Presentation of non-GAAP information
Included in this release are measures of financial performance that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. T hese measures include 
adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA (calculated as earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortization), adjusted EBIT and EBIT (calculated 
as earnings before interest and tax), adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and net debt .  In arriving at these non-
GAAP measures, we exclude items that either have a non-recurring impact on the income statement or which, in the judgment of our management, 
are items that, either as a result of their nature or size, could, were they not singled out, potentially cause investors to extrapolate future performance 
from an improper b ase. Note that while amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, the 
revenue of the acquired entities and all other expenses unless otherwise stated, are reflected in our non-GAAP financial performance earnings 
measures. W hile not all inclusive, examples of these items  include:
• material restructuring programs, including associated costs such as employee severance, pension and related benefits, impairment of 
property and equipment and other assets, accelerated depreciation, termination payments for contracts and leases, contractual obligations, 
and any other qualifying costs related t o restructuring pla ns;
• material sales and earnings from disposed or ceased operations and any associated profit or loss on sale of businesses or subsidiaries;
• changes in the fair value of economic hedging instruments on commercial paper;
• significant pension settlements;
• impairments in goodwill and equity method investments;
• material acquisition compensation and transaction costs such as due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, and integration costs;
• material purchase accounting adjustments for inventory;
• amortization of acquired intangible assets from business combination;
• gains or losses on significant property and divestitures and significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery;
• certain regulatory and legal matters;
• impacts from hyperinflation accounting; and
• impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Amcor also evaluates performance on a comparable constant currency basis, which measures financial results assuming constant foreign currency 
exchange rates used for translation based on the average rates in effect for the comparable prior year period. In order to compute comparable 
constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, current-year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates 
and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We then adjust for other items affecting 
comparability. While not all inclusive, examples of items affecting comparability include the difference between sales or earnings in the current period 
and the prior period related to acquired, disposed, or ceased operations. Comparable constant currency net sales performance also excludes the 
impact from passing through movements in raw material costs.  
Management has used and uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the Company’s reporting 
segments and certain of the measures are used as a component of Amcor’s Board of Directors’ measurement of Amcor’s performance for incentive 
compensation purposes. Amcor believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors to perform comparisons of current and 
historical performance of the Company. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP 
financial measure has been provided herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the 
ultimate outcome and timing of certain significant forward-looking items without unreasonable effort.  These items include but are not limited to the 
impact of foreign exchange translation, restructuring program costs, asset impairments, possible gains and losses on the sale of assets, and certain 
tax related events. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP earnings and cash flow 
measures for the guidance period.
Dividends
Amcor has received a waiver from the ASX’s settlement operating rules, which will allow the Company to defer processing conversions between its 
ordinary share and CDI registers from S eptember 6, 202 3 to September 7, 2023  inclusive.
