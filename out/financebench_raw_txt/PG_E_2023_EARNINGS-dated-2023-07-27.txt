OAKLAND  — PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) recorded second  quarter 2023  income 
available for  common shareholders of $406 million , or $0.19  per diluted share, as reported in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This compares with income 
available for  common shareholders of $356 million , or $0.17  per diluted share, for the second  
quarter of 2022 .
The increase in GAAP results was primarily driven by lower costs related to PG&E Corporation’s 
and Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s (Utility) reorganization cases under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Chapter 11) and lower wildfire-related costs, and higher Fire Victim Trust 
tax benefit net of securitization.
“Through the first half of 2023, we feel confident that we continue to reduce physical risk on our 
system overall, and that our investments since 2017 have made a dramatic difference in 
preventing catastrophic wildfires,” said Patti Poppe, CEO of PG&E Corporation.  “We also 
expect continued steady and predictable improvement in our financial health, which in turn 
allows us to further invest and innovate as we build a climate-resilient energy system for 
California’s future.”
Non-GAAP Core Earnings  
PG&E Corporation’s non-GAAP core earnings, which exclude non-core items, were $494 
million , or $0.23  per diluted share, in the second  quarter of 2023 , compared with $536 million , or 
$0.25  per diluted share, during the same period in 2022 .
The decrease in quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP core earnings is primarily driven by timing 
items and other increases, including property taxes, partially offset by savings in operating and 
maintenance costs net of redeployment.
Non-core items, which management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, 
totaled $88 million  after tax, or $0.04  per diluted share, in the second  quarter of 2023 , compared 
with $180 million  after tax, or $0.08  per diluted share, during the same period in 2022 .
PG&E Corporation uses “non-GAAP core earnings,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure, in 
order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial 
performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items. See the 
accompanying tables for a reconciliation of non-GAAP core earnings to consolidated earnings 
available for common shareholders.
2023 Guidance
PG&E Corporation is updating 2023 GAAP earnings guidance in the range of $1.04  to $1.13  per 
diluted share. Factors driving GAAP earnings include costs related to unrecoverable interest 
expense of $370 million to $430 million after tax and other earnings factors, including allowance 
for funds used during construction equity, incentive revenues, tax benefits, and cost savings, net 
of below-the-line costs. Additional factors include the amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset and 
accretion of the related Wildfire Fund liability, wildfire-related costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the 
Utility’s reorganization cases under Chapter 11, and investigation remedies, partially offset by 
Fire Victim Trust tax benefits and prior period net regulatory impact.
The guidance range for projected 2023 non-GAAP core earnings is reaffirmed at $1.19  to $1.23  
per diluted share. The guidance range for non-core items, which management does not 
consider representative of ongoing earnings, is updated to $210  million to $320  million after tax.
Guidance is based on various assumptions and forecasts, including those relating to authorized 
revenues, future expenses, capital expenditures, rate base, equity issuances, and certain other 
factors.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company
Non-GAAP Core Earnings and Non-GAAP Core EPS
“Non-GAAP core earnings” and “Non-GAAP core EPS,” also referred to as “non-GAAP core earnings per share,” are 
non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP core earnings is calculated as income available for common shareholders 
less non-core items. “Non-core items” include items that management does not consider representative of ongoing 
earnings and affect comparability of financial results between periods, consisting of the items listed in Exhibit A. Non-
GAAP core EPS is calculated as non-GAAP core earnings divided by common shares outstanding (taken on a basic basis 
in the event of a GAAP loss and a diluted basis in the event of a GAAP gain). 
PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on “non-GAAP core earnings” and 
“non-GAAP core EPS” in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial 
performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items. PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
use non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS to understand and compare operating results across reporting 
periods for various purposes including internal budgeting and forecasting, short- and long-term operating planning, and 
employee incentive compensation. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that non-GAAP core earnings and non-
GAAP core EPS provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business, allowing for a better comparison 
against historical results and expectations for future performance. With respect to our projection of non-GAAP core EPS 
for the years 2024-2026, PG&E Corporation is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the reconciling items that may 
affect GAAP net income without unreasonable effort. The reconciling items are primarily due to the future impact of 
wildfire-related costs, timing of regulatory recoveries, special tax items, and investigation remedies. These reconciling 
items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, the 
GAAP measures.
Non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS are not substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures such as 
consolidated income available for common shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by 
other companies.
