corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date
such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing
and (ii) in the case of such Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by
the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Euros. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding
amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender’s Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement and shall be
made available in same day funds to the relevant Borrower’s account at the Agent’s address referred to in Section 8.02.
 
(e)           The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.
 
Section 2.03         [Reserved].
 
Section 2.04         Fees.
 
(a)           Commitment Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee on the aggregate
amount of such Lender’s unused portion of the Commitment from the Effective Date in the case of each Initial Lender and from the effective date
specified in the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date (on
a daily basis) at a rate per annum equal to 0.025%, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each June, September, December and March,
commencing June 30, 2023, and on the Termination Date.
 
(b)           Agent’s Fees. The Company shall pay to the Agent for its own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed between the
Company and the Agent.
 
Section 2.05         Termination, Reduction or Increase of Commitments.
 
(a)           The Company shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days’ notice to the Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably
in part the unused portions of the respective Commitments of the Lenders; provided that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of
$25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and provided, further that the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the
Lenders shall not be reduced to an amount that is less than the aggregate principal amount of the Advances then outstanding.
 
(b)           If any Lender (i) shall make a demand under Section 2.11 or 2.14 or (ii) is a Defaulting Lender or Non-Consenting Lender, the
Company shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days’ notice, to terminate in full the Commitment of such Lender or to demand that
such Lender assign to one or more Persons all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.07. If the Company
shall elect to terminate in full the Commitment of any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.05(b), the Company shall pay to such Lender, on the
effective date of such Lender’s Commitment termination, an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing
to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such
Lender under this Agreement, whereupon such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto.
 
16
 
 
(c)           (i)    From time to time, the Company may propose to increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments by an aggregate
amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (a “Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase”) in the manner set
forth below, provided that:
 
(1)             no Default shall have occurred and be continuing either as of the applicable Increase Notice Date (as
hereinafter defined) or as of the related Increase Date (as hereinafter defined); and
 
(2)             after giving effect to any such increase, the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall not exceed
$4,950,000,000.
 
(ii)         From time to time the Company may request an increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments by delivering to
the Agent a notice (an “Increase Notice”; the date of delivery thereof to the Agent being the “Increase Notice Date”) specifying (1) the
Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, (2) the proposed date (the “Increase Date”) on which the Commitments would be so
increased (which Increase Date may not be fewer than 30 days after the Increase Notice Date) and (3) the New Lenders, if any, to whom
the Company desires to offer the opportunity to commit to all or a portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase. The Agent
shall in turn promptly notify each Lender of the Company’s request by sending each Lender a copy of such notice.
 
(iii)        Not later than the date five days after the Increase Notice Date, the Agent shall notify each New Lender, if any, identified
in the related Increase Notice of the opportunity to commit to all or any portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase. Each
such New Lender may irrevocably commit to all or a portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase (such New Lender’s
“Proposed New Commitment”) by notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the Company) before 11:00 A.M. (New
York City time) on the date that is 10 days after the Increase Notice Date; provided that:
 
(1)             the Proposed New Commitment of each New Lender shall be in an amount not less than $25,000,000; and
 
(2)             each New Lender that submits a Proposed New Commitment shall enter into an agreement in form and
substance satisfactory to the Company and the Agent pursuant to which such New Lender shall undertake a Commitment (and, if
any such New Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender’s Commitment hereunder on such
date), and shall pay to the Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.
 
(iv)        If, and only if, the aggregate Proposed New Commitments of all of the New Lenders shall be less than the Proposed
Aggregate Commitment Increase, then (unless the Company otherwise requests) the Agent shall, on or prior to the date that is 15 days
after the Increase Notice Date, notify each Lender of the opportunity to so commit to all or any portion of the Proposed Aggregate
Commitment Increase not committed to by New Lenders pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(iii). Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it
elects to do so, irrevocably offer to commit to all or a portion of such remainder (such Lender’s “Proposed Increased Commitment”) by
notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the Company) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date
five days before the Increase Date.
 
17
 
 
(v)           (1) If the aggregate amount of Proposed New Commitments and Proposed Increased Commitments (such aggregate
amount, the “Total Committed Increase”) equals or exceeds $25,000,000, then, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.05(c)(i):
 
(A)         effective on and as of the Increase Date, the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be increased
by the Total Committed Increase (provided that the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall in no event be
increased pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) to more than $4,950,000,000) and shall be allocated among the New Lenders
and the Lenders as provided in Section 2.05(c)(vi); and
 
(B)         on the Increase Date, if any Advances are then outstanding, the Company shall borrow Advances from
all or certain of the Lenders and/or (subject to compliance by the Company with Section 8.04(c)) prepay Advances of
all or certain of the Lenders such that, after giving effect thereto, the Advances (including, without limitation, the Types
and Interest Periods thereof) shall be held by the Lenders (including for such purposes New Lenders) ratably in
accordance with their respective Commitments.
 
(2)           If the Total Committed Increase is less than $25,000,000, then the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall
not be changed pursuant to this Section 2.05(c).
 
(vi)          The Total Committed Increase shall be allocated among New Lenders having Proposed New Commitments and Lenders
having Proposed Increased Commitments, if any, as follows:
 
(1)           If the Total Committed Increase shall be at least $25,000,000 and less than or equal to the Proposed Aggregate
Commitment Increase, then (x) the initial Commitment of each New Lender shall be such New Lender’s Proposed New
Commitment and (y) the Commitment of each Lender shall be increased by such Lender’s Proposed Increased Commitment, if
any.
 
(2)           If the Total Committed Increase shall be greater than the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then the
Total Committed Increase shall be allocated:
 
(x)          first to New Lenders (to the extent of their respective Proposed New Commitments) in such a manner
as the Company shall agree; and
 
(y)         then to Lenders on a pro rata basis based on the ratio of each Lender’s Proposed Increased
Commitment (if any) to the aggregate amount of the Proposed Increased Commitments of all of the Lenders.
 
(vii)         No increase in the Commitments contemplated hereby shall become effective until the Agent shall have received (x)
Notes payable to each New Lender and each other Lender whose Commitment is being increased to the extent such New Lender or
Lender has requested such a Note pursuant to Section 2.13(e), and (y) evidence satisfactory to the Agent (including an update of the
opinion of counsel provided pursuant to Section 3.01(f)(iv)) that such increases in the Commitments, and borrowings thereunder, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and other action on the part of the Company.
 
18
 
 
Section 2.06         Repayment of Advances; Extension of Termination Date.
 
(a)           (i) Subject to the next succeeding sentence, each Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders on the
Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Advances made to such Borrower then outstanding, and all accrued but unpaid interest in
connection therewith and (ii) the Company shall pay to the Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders on the Termination Date all fees and all
other amounts due hereunder. The Company may, upon notice to the Agent not later than the Termination Date, elect (the “Term Loan Election”)
to convert all of the Advances outstanding on the Termination Date in effect at such time into a term loan which the Company shall repay in full
ratably to the Lenders on the Maturity Date; provided that the Term Loan Election may not be exercised unless the conditions set forth in Section
3.03 are satisfied on the date of notice of the Term Loan Election and on the Term Loan Conversion Date. All Advances converted into a term loan
pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) shall continue to constitute Advances except that the Borrowers may not reborrow pursuant to Section 2.01 after
all or any portion of such Advances have been prepaid pursuant to Section 2.10.
 
(b)           The Company may, by written notice to the Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders) not more than 60 nor less than 30
days prior to each Termination Date (the Termination Date following such notice, the “Extension Date”), request that the Termination Date then in
effect (the “Existing Termination Date”) be extended for a period of 364 days; provided, however, that the Company shall not have made the Term
Loan Election for Advances outstanding on such Termination Date prior to such time. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such
request. If a Lender agrees, acting in its sole discretion, to so extend its Commitment (each such Lender, an “Extending Lender”), it will notify the
Agent, in writing, of its decision to do so not more than 30 nor less than 20 days before the Extension Date; it being understood that failure to give
such notice shall be deemed a decision not to extend. If any Lender fails to accept the Company’s request for extension of the Termination Date
(each such Lender, a “Declining Lender”), the Company shall have the right, prior to the Extension Date, to require any Declining Lender to
assign in full its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee (including any Extending Lender) designated by the
Company that agrees to accept all of such rights and obligations and agrees to such extension (a “Replacement Lender”), provided that (i) such
assignment is otherwise in compliance with Section 8.07, (ii) such Declining Lender receives payment in full of the principal amount of all
Advances owing to such Declining Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such payment of principal and all other amounts
payable to such Declining Lender under this Agreement and (iii) any such assignment shall be effective on the Extension Date. If (A) there are no
Declining Lenders or all of the Declining Lenders are replaced by Replacement Lenders as set forth above and (B) no Default shall have occurred
and be continuing immediately prior to the Extension Date, the Termination Date shall be extended by 364 days (except that, if the date on which
the Termination Date is to be extended is not a Business Day, such Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day),
and the Agent shall promptly notify the Company of such extension. If there are any Declining Lenders that are not replaced in accordance with
the terms above, the Company may (1) withdraw its request for an extension and the Existing Termination Date will remain in effect or (2)
provided that no Default shall have occurred and be continuing immediately prior to the Extension Date, on the Extension Date pay any such
Declining Lenders in full for all principal, interest and other amounts owing to such Declining Lender under this Agreement, reduce the aggregate
Commitments of the Lenders by the amount of the Commitment of such Declining Lenders, and extend the Termination Date for 364 days at the
reduced aggregate Commitment amount.
 
19
 
 
Section 2.07          Interest on Advances.
 
Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made to such Borrower owing to each Lender from the date of
such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:
 
(a)           Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the
Base Rate in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December during
such periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.
 
(b)           Term SOFR Advances. During such periods as such Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times
during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (x) Adjusted Term SOFR for such Interest Period for such Advance plus (y) 0.625%,
payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day that
occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such Term SOFR Advance shall be
Converted or paid in full.
 
(c)           Eurocurrency Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at
all times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (x) the EURIBO Rate for such Interest Period for such Advance plus (y)
0.625%, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each
day that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurocurrency Rate
Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.
 
(d)           Default Rate. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.01(a), the principal
of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the Advances and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
(including without limitation fees and expenses) shall bear interest, payable on demand, at the Default Rate.
 
Section 2.08         Interest Rate Determination.
 
(a)          The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for
purposes of Section 2.07.
 
(b)           If, due to a major disruption in the interbank funding market with respect to any Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate
Advances, the Required Lenders notify the Agent that the Adjusted Term SOFR or the EURIBO Rate, as applicable, for any Interest Period for
such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Term SOFR
Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrowers and the Lenders, whereupon
(i) each Term SOFR Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance,
(ii) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (iii)
the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended
until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
 
20
 
 
(c)           If the Company shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate
Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of “Interest Period” in Section 1.01, the Agent will forthwith so notify the
Company and the Lenders and the Company will be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month.
 
(d)           On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances
constituting any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than the Borrowing Minimum, such Advances shall
automatically (i) if such Advances are Term SOFR Advances, Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Advances are Eurocurrency Rate
Advances, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into Base Rate Advances.
 
(e)           If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the
Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing, (i) each Term SOFR Advance and each Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall
automatically (A) if such Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate
Advance, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to
make, or to Convert Advances into, Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended.
 
(f)            If Term SOFR cannot be determined in accordance with the definition thereof, or if the EURIBO Rate does not appear
Bloomberg, Thompson Reuters or on another nationally recognized service selected by the Agent,
 
(i)          the Agent shall forthwith notify the Company and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for the
applicable Advances,
 
(ii)         each such affected Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor (A) if such
Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, be
prepaid by the applicable Borrower or be automatically exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base
Rate Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and
 
(iii)        the obligation of the Lenders to make, or Convert Advances into, Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances,
as applicable, shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist.
 
21
 
 
Section 2.09         Optional Conversion or Continuation of Advances.
 
The Company may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third U.S.
Government Securities Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion or continuation, and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08, 2.12 and
2.18, Convert all or any part of the Advances denominated in Dollars of one Type constituting the same Borrowing into Advances denominated in Dollars
of the other Type or continue all or any part of the Advance of one Type constituting the same Borrowing or Advances of the same Type and in the same
currency; provided, however, that any Conversion of Term SOFR Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest
Period for such Term SOFR Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Term SOFR Advances shall be in an amount not less than the
Borrowing Minimum and no Conversion of any Advances shall result in more separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(b). Each such notice
of a Conversion or continuation shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion or continuation, (ii) the Dollar
denominated Advances to be Converted or continued, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Term SOFR Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period
for each such Advance. Each notice of Conversion or continuation shall be irrevocable and binding on the Company.
 
Section 2.10         Prepayments of Advances.
 
(a)           Optional. The Company may, upon at least one Business Day’s notice, in the case of Base Rate Advances, and three U.S.
Government Securities Business Days’ notice, in the case of Term SOFR Advances, to the Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Company shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Advances constituting
part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount
prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of the Borrowing Minimum or a Borrowing
Multiple in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a Term SOFR Advance or a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, the Company
shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(c).
 
(b)           Mandatory. (i) If, on any date, the Agent notifies the Company in accordance with clause (iii) below that, as of the most recent
interest payment date, the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars then outstanding plus (B) the
Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to such interest payment date) of the aggregate principal amount of all
Advances denominated in Euros then outstanding exceeds 105% of the aggregate Commitments on such date, the Borrowers shall, as soon as
practicable and in any event within five Business Days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any Advances in an
aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate Commitments on such date (subject to the
proviso to this sentence set forth below), together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the aggregate principal amount of
Advances prepaid; provided that if the aggregate principal amount of Base Rate Advances outstanding at the time of such required prepayment is
less than the amount of such required prepayment, the portion of such required prepayment in excess of the aggregate principal amount of Base
Rate Advances then outstanding shall be deferred until the last day of the next maturing Interest Period of the outstanding Term SOFR Advances
or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, in an aggregate amount equal to the excess of such required prepayment. The Agent shall give prompt notice of
any prepayment required under this Section 2.10(b) to the Company in accordance with clause (iii) below and the Lenders.
 
(ii)           Each prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall be made together with any interest accrued to the date of such
prepayment on the principal amounts prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a Term SOFR Advance or a Eurocurrency Rate Advance on a
date other than the last day of an Interest Period, any additional amounts which the applicable Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse to the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(c).
 
22
 
 
(iii)          The Agent shall calculate on the date of each Notice of Borrowing and on each interest payment date the sum of (A) the
aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior
to the date such calculation is required under this clause (iii)) of the aggregate principal amount of all Eurocurrency Rate Advances and shall give
prompt notice (and in any event no later than thirty days) of any prepayment required in connection with an interest payment date under this
Section 2.10(b) to the Company and the Lenders.
 
Section 2.11         Increased Costs.
 
(a)           If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation or administration of any law
or regulation by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or
request from any central bank or other governmental authority that would be complied with generally by similarly situated banks acting
reasonably (whether or not having the force of law and for the avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines
or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued after the date hereof in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act or promulgated after the date hereof by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III), there
shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate
Advances (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 2.11(b) other than as set forth below) by an amount deemed by such Lender to
be material, then the Company shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent
for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of
such increased cost, submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.
 
(b)           If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental or regulatory authority which becomes effective after the date hereof (for the
avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued
after the date hereof in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or promulgated after the date hereof by
the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or
foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, there shall be any increase in the amount of capital or liquidity required or
expected to be maintained by any Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased
by or based upon the existence of such Lender’s Advances or commitment to lend and other commitments of this type by an amount deemed by
such Lender to be material, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Company shall pay to the Agent for
the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such
corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be
allocable to the existence of such Lender’s Advances or commitment to lend hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Company
and the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes as to the calculations therein, absent manifest error. Such certificate
shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender’s
treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in
circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.
 
23
 
 
Section 2.12         Illegality.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent (and provide to the Company an opinion of counsel to
the effect) that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other
governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Term
SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances hereunder, (a) each Term
SOFR Advance or each Eurocurrency Rate Advance, as applicable, made by such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, (i) if such Advance is a
Term SOFR Advance, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, be exchanged into an Equivalent
amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate
Advances, as applicable, or to Convert Advances into Term SOFR Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders
that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
 
Section 2.13         Payments and Computations; Evidence of Advances.
 
(a)           The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, except with respect to principal or, interest on, and
other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in Euros, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the
Agent at the applicable Agent’s Account in same day funds without deduction, off-set or counterclaim except as provided in Section 2.14. The
Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to,
Advances denominated in Euros, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Euros to the Agent at the applicable
Agent’s Account in same day funds without deduction, off-set or counterclaim except as provided in Section 2.14. The Agent will promptly
thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest, commitment fees ratably (other than amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.05(b), 2.06(b), 2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices,
and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office,
in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Assumption and recording of
the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and
Assumption, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee
thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such
effective date directly between themselves.
 
(b)           All computations of interest based on the Base Rate (determined pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof) and of
commitment fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based
on Adjusted Term SOFR, the EURIBO Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case
for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable.
Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
24
 
 
(c)           Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of
interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Term SOFR
Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Business Day.
 
(d)           Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders
hereunder that a Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the
Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal
to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender
shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of
Advances denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in
Euros.
 
(e)           The Advances made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by
the Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent
manifest error of the amount of the Advances made by the Lenders to a Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record
or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of a Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect
to the Advances. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any
Lender made through the Agent, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Agent) a Note which shall evidence such
Lender's Advances in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note or Notes and endorse thereon the date,
Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Advances and payments with respect thereto.
 
(f)            To the extent that the Agent receives funds for application to the amounts owing by any Borrower under or in respect of this
Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders in
accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13, the Agent shall be entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into Euros or from
Dollars to Euros or from Euros to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to enable the Agent to distribute such funds in accordance
with the terms of this Section 2.13; provided that each Borrower and each of the Lenders hereby agree that the Agent shall not be liable or
responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Borrower or such Lender as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies
affected pursuant to this Section 2.13(f) or as a result of the failure of the Agent to effect any such conversion or exchange; and provided further
that such Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and hold the Agent and each Lender harmless, for any and all losses, costs and
expenses incurred by the Agent or any Lender for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any currencies)
in accordance with this Section 2.13(f).
 
25
 
 
(g)           In connection with the use or administration of any Benchmark, the Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from
time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become
effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. The Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Lenders
of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of any Benchmark.
 
Section 2.14         Taxes.
 
(a)           Each Lender is exempt from any withholding tax imposed under the laws of the United States in respect of any fees, interest or
other payments to which it is entitled pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes (the “Income”) because (i) the Lender is a United States Person; (ii) the
Income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States within the meaning of Section 871 of the Internal Revenue
Code; or (iii) the Income is eligible for an exemption by reason of a tax treaty. The Agent is exempt from any withholding tax imposed under the laws of
the United States in respect of the Income because the Agent is a United States Person.
 
(b)           Each Lender that is a United States Person shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter
if requested in writing by the Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9, or any successor or other form provided by the Internal Revenue Service. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (each,
a “Foreign Lender”) shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the
Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E,
W-8ECI or W-8IMY (accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-9 or other certification documents from each
beneficial owner, as appropriate), as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Foreign
Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on any Income that is the subject of such forms. If the relevant
Borrower determines, based on the form provided by a Foreign Lender (or the failure to provide such a form) at the time such Foreign Lender first becomes
a party to this Agreement that a United States withholding tax rate in excess of zero applies to payments made by such Borrower to the Foreign Lender
under this Agreement, such Borrower shall be permitted to deduct amounts from payments to such Foreign Lender to the extent required to pay
withholding tax at such rate, and such amounts shall be considered excluded from Taxes as defined in Section 2.14(c); provided, however, that, if on the
date of the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which a Foreign Lender becomes a Foreign Lender, pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption
provisions of Article VIII, the Foreign Lender assignor was entitled to payments under Section 2.14(c) in respect of United States withholding tax paid at
such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to Taxes that are imposed pursuant to a Change in Law (defined below) after the
date of Assignment and Assumption) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Foreign Lender assignee on such date. For the
avoidance of doubt, the obligations of any Borrower under Section 2.14 of this Agreement shall not be increased as the result of any assignment pursuant to
Article VIII of this Agreement with respect to United States withholding tax; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the obligation of any
Borrower in respect of Taxes imposed as the result of any Change in Law after the date of the relevant Assignment and Assumption.
 
26
 
 
(c)           Except as set forth in Section 2.14(b) or as required by applicable law, any and all payments by any Borrower hereunder or under
the Notes shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any withholding taxes imposed on a Lender (such withholding taxes being hereinafter
referred to as “Taxes”, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall exclude any Excluded Taxes). If any Borrower is required to deduct any Taxes from or in
respect of any Income, then: (i) the sum payable to such Lender shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions for such
Taxes (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14) such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes by the Company
pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Borrower shall be entitled to pay any Taxes in any lawful
manner so as to reduce any deductions and such Lender shall to the extent it is reasonably able provide any documentation or file any forms as may be
required by the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental agency. In addition, if any Lender or the Agent (in lieu of such Lender), as the case
may be, is required to pay directly any Taxes because a Borrower cannot or does not legally or timely do so, the Company shall indemnify such Lender or
Agent for payment of such Taxes, without duplication of, or increase in, the amount in respect of Taxes otherwise due to the Lender.
 
(d)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, the sum payable to a Lender shall not be increased, and no indemnification payments shall be
made, pursuant to Section 2.14(c) with respect to any United States federal withholding taxes any Borrower is required to deduct from or in respect of any
Income, except to the extent that (i) such Borrower is required to deduct such taxes as a result of the enactment, promulgation, execution or ratification of,
or any change in or amendment to, any United States law or any tax treaty (or in the application or official interpretation of any law or any tax treaty) that
occurs after the date a Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement (a “Change in Law”) or (ii) such taxes are “Taxes” solely as a result of the
application of the proviso to the penultimate sentence of Section 2.14(b).
 
(e)           In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes,
charges or similar levies (excluding any income or franchise taxes, business taxes or capital taxes of any nature) that arise from the execution or delivery, or
otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”). If a Lender is required to pay directly Other Taxes
because a Borrower cannot or does not legally or timely do so, the Company shall indemnify such Lender for such payment of Other Taxes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.14, each Lender shall upon the written request of and at the expense of the Company use
reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, any such Other Taxes that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause imposition on such Lender of any
material legal or regulatory burdens.
 
(f)            To the extent any Lender is entitled to any exemption or reduction of foreign withholding taxes, each Lender shall cooperate with
each Borrower by providing to the extent reasonably within its means any forms requested by such Borrower substantiating such reduction or exemption
from such foreign withholding taxes required by any governmental agency.
 
(g)           For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) or (f) relating to
certain forms intended to reduce withholding taxes (other than if such failure is due to a Change in Law that makes compliance with subsection (b) or (f)
unduly burdensome in the reasonable judgment of such Lender), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 2.14.
 
27
 
 
(h)           Upon a Change in Law or the imposition of any Taxes, a Lender shall, upon the written request of and at the expense of the
Company, use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, any such Taxes that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause the imposition on such
Lender of any material legal or regulatory burdens.
 
(i)            Any request by any Lender for payment of any amount under this Section 2.14 shall be accompanied by a certification that such
Lender’s claim for said amount is generally consistent with such Lender’s treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with
such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any
confidential or proprietary information therein.
 
(j)             If any Lender shall become aware, including by means of a request by the Company, that it is entitled to receive a refund
(including, for all purposes of this subsection (j), any refund in the form of a credit from the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes or Other Taxes) in respect of
Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.14, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall, within 30 days after
receipt of a request by the Company (whether as a result of notification that it has made to a Borrower or otherwise) to seek such refund, make a claim for
such refund at such Borrower’s expense. No Lender shall seek a refund without such approval by a Borrower. If a Lender receives a refund in respect of
any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.14, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of such refund and shall within 30 days from the date of receipt of
such refund pay over the amount of such refund to such Borrower to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower
under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund plus any interest paid or credited with respect to such refund, net
of all out-of-pocket expenses and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from one to another currency incurred by the Agent of
such Lender; provided that the applicable Borrower, upon the request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed with respect to such Taxes or Other Taxes by the relevant governmental agency) to the Agent or such
Lender in the event the Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such governmental agency. This subsection shall not be construed to
require the Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to any
Borrower or any other Person.
 
(k)           If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA
if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the
Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or
times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)
(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as may be necessary for the
Borrowers and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations
under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this subsection (k), “FATCA” shall include
any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
(l)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 2.14 shall be the only provisions
requiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bear the cost of (or arising from) any taxes otherwise borne by any Lender. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, “taxes” includes any tax, governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
withholding on amounts paid to or by the Company or its Subsidiaries), together with any interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed
with respect thereto.
 
28
 
 
Section 2.15         Sharing of Payments, Etc.
 
If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of
the Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.05(b), 2.06(b), 2.11, 2.14, 8.04(c) or 8.07) in excess of its ratable share thereof, such Lender
shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender
to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from
such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the
extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s
required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing
Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to
this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
Section 2.16         Use of Proceeds.
 
The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and the Company agrees that such proceeds shall be used) for general corporate purposes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, including but not limited to working capital, capital investments and acquisitions. No Borrower shall knowingly use the
proceeds of any Advance to fund any activities or business (a) of or with any individual or entity that is included on the SDN List or (b) in, or with the
government of, any Sanctioned Country, except in the case of (a) or (b) to the extent licensed by OFAC or otherwise permissible under U.S. law.
 
Section 2.17         Borrowings by Borrowing Subsidiaries.
 
(a)           The Company may, at any time or from time to time upon not less than 10 Business Days’ notice in the case of any Subsidiary so
designated after the Effective Date, designate one or more Subsidiaries as Borrowers hereunder by furnishing to the Agent a letter (a “Designation
Letter”) in duplicate, in substantially the form of Exhibit D, duly completed and executed by the Company and such Subsidiary. The Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of the Company’s notice of such pending designation by the Company and the identity of the Subsidiary. Following
the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 2.17(a), if the designation of such Subsidiary obligates the Agent or any Lender to comply with
“know your customer” or similar identification procedures (including without limitation the Beneficial Ownership Regulation) in circumstances
where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of the Agent or any Lender, supply
such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lender in order for the Agent or such Lender to carry out
and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary “know your customer” or other similar checks under all applicable laws and
regulations. Upon any such designation of a Subsidiary, such Subsidiary shall be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a Borrower entitled to borrow
Advances on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
 
29
 
 
If the Company shall designate as a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State
thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Agent and the Company, fulfill its Commitment by causing an Affiliate or a branch of such Lender to
act as the Lender in respect of such Borrowing Subsidiary.
 
As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Agent of the Company’s intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Borrowing
Subsidiary, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice, if such Borrowing Subsidiary is organized under the
laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for
the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Borrowing Subsidiary directly or through an Affiliate or a branch of such Lender as
provided in the immediately preceding paragraph (a “Protesting Lender”) shall so notify the Company and the Agent in writing. With respect to
each Protesting Lender, the Company shall, effective on or before the date that such Borrowing Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow
hereunder, either (A) notify the Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated; provided
that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances, accrued interest thereon,
accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee Lender (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Borrowing Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts), or (B) cancel its request to designate
such Subsidiary as a “Borrowing Subsidiary” hereunder.
 
(b)           If all principal of and interest on all Advances made to any Borrowing Subsidiary have been paid in full, the Company may
terminate the status of such Borrowing Subsidiary as a Borrower hereunder by furnishing to the Agent a letter (a “Termination Letter”) in
substantially the form of Exhibit E, duly completed and executed by the Company. Any Termination Letter furnished hereunder shall be effective
upon receipt by the Agent, which shall promptly notify the Lenders, whereupon the Lenders shall, upon payment in full of all amounts owing by
such Borrower hereunder, promptly deliver to the Company (through the Agent) the Notes, if any, of such former Borrower. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the delivery of a Termination Letter with respect to any Borrower shall not terminate (i) any obligation of such Borrower that remains
unpaid at the time of such delivery (including without limitation any obligation arising thereafter in respect of such Borrower under Section 2.11
or 2.14) or (ii) the obligations of the Company under Article IX with respect to any such unpaid obligations; provided that if the status of such
Borrowing Subsidiary has been terminated as aforesaid because the Company has sold or transferred its interest in such Subsidiary, and the
Company so certifies to the Agent at the time of the delivery of such Termination Letter, and subject to payment of said principal and interest, (A)
such Subsidiary shall automatically, upon the effectiveness of the delivery of such Termination Letter and certification, cease to have any
obligation under this Agreement or the Notes and (B) the Company shall automatically be deemed to have unconditionally assumed, as primary
obligor, and hereby agrees to pay and perform, all of such obligations.
 
30
 
 
Section 2.18         Benchmark Replacement Setting.
 
(a)           Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark
Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to any setting of any Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement
is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark
Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent
Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and the
definition of “Adjusted Term SOFR” shall be deemed modified to delete clause (b) for any calculation of Term SOFR and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement
is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark
Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00
p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any
amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Agent has not received, by
such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. If the Benchmark Replacement is
Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.
 
(b)           Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Agent
will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amendments implementing
such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.
 
(c)           Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of (i) any
Benchmark Replacement Date and the related Benchmark Replacement, (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes, (iii) the removal or
reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (d) below and (iv) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability
Period. For the avoidance of doubt, any notice required to be delivered by the Agent as set forth in this Section 2.18 may be provided, at the option of the
Agent (in its sole discretion), in one or more notices and may be delivered together with, or as part of any amendment which implements any Benchmark
Replacement or Conforming Changes. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of
Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.18, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an
event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error
and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement, except, in each case, as expressly required
pursuant to this Section 2.18.
 
(d)           Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time (including in connection
with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate or the
EURIBO Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to
time as selected by the Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public
statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Agent may modify
the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor
that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a
Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including
a Benchmark Replacement), then the Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such
previously removed tenor.
 
31
 
 
(e)           Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Company’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability
Period with respect to a given Benchmark, (i) the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Term SOFR Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Term SOFR Advances, or a Borrowing of, or continuation of, Eurocurrency Rate Advances, in each case, to be made, converted or
continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period denominated in the applicable Available Currency and, failing that, (A) in the case of any request
for any affected Term SOFR Borrowing, if applicable, the applicable Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Base
Rate Borrowing or conversion to Base Rate Advances in the amount specified therein and (B) in the case of any request for any affected Eurocurrency Rate
Borrowing, then such request shall be ineffective and (ii)(A) any outstanding affected Term SOFR Advances, if applicable, will be deemed to have been
converted into Base Rate Advances at the end of the applicable Interest Period and (B) any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate Advances, at the
applicable Borrower’s election, shall either (I) be converted into Base Rate Advances denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent
thereof) at the end of the applicable Interest Period or (II) be prepaid in full at the end of the applicable Interest Period; provided that, with respect to any
Eurocurrency Rate Advance, if no election is made by the applicable Borrower by the earlier of (x) the date that is three Business Days after receipt by such
Borrower of such notice and (y) the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Advance, such Borrower shall be deemed to
have elected clause (I) above. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid
or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 8.04(c). During a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to any
Benchmark or at any time that a tenor for any then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-
current Benchmark that is the subject of such Benchmark Unavailability Period or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any
determination of the Base Rate.
 
(f)            Certain Defined Terms. As used in this Section 2.18:
 
“Available Currency” means Dollars or Euros.
 
“Available Tenor” means, as of any date of determination and with respect to the then-current Benchmark, as applicable, for an Available
Currency, (x) if such Benchmark is a term rate, any tenor for such Benchmark (or component thereof) that is or may be used for determining the length of
an interest period pursuant to this Agreement, as of such date and not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any tenor for such Benchmark that is then-
removed from the definition of “Interest Period” pursuant to clause (d) of this Section 2.18.
 
“Benchmark” means, initially, the Relevant Rate; provided that if a Benchmark Transition Event, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date
have occurred with respect to such Relevant Rate or the then-current Benchmark, then “Benchmark” means the applicable Benchmark Replacement to the
extent that such Benchmark Replacement has replaced such prior benchmark rate pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 2.18.
 
“Benchmark Replacement” means, with respect to any Benchmark Transition Event for any then-current Benchmark the first alternative set forth
in the order below that can be determined by the Agent for the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date; provided, that in the case of Advances
denominated in Euros, the “Benchmark Replacement” shall mean the alternative set forth in clause (b) below:
 
(a)           with respect to Term SOFR Advances, Daily Simple SOFR plus 0.10%; or
 
32

Section 2.19         Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a)           Defaulting Lender Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
(i)            Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent
with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.
 
(ii)           Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent hereunder
for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VI or otherwise) or received
by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 8.05 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent
as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder; second, as the Company may
request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its
portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent; third, if so determined by the Agent and the Company, to be
held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with
respect to Advances under this Agreement; fourth, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Company as
a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such
Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and fifth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a
court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Advances in respect of
which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Advances were made at a time when the conditions
set forth in Section 3.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Advances of all Non-Defaulting
Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Advances owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all
Advances are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or
payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall
be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(iii)          Commitment Fees. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which
that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Company shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required
to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
 
35
 
 
(b)           Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Company and the Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Agent
will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that
Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Advances of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the
Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Advances to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments, whereupon
such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or
payments made by or on behalf of the Company while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent
otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of
any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

(d)           The Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries shall fail to pay any principal of or premium or interest on any Debt that is
outstanding in a principal or notional amount of at least $500,000,000 in the aggregate (but excluding Debt outstanding hereunder) of the
Company or such Material Subsidiary (as the case may be), when the same becomes due and payable (whether by scheduled maturity, required
prepayment, acceleration, demand or otherwise), and such failure shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any, specified in the
agreement or instrument relating to such Debt; or any other event shall occur or condition shall exist under any agreement or instrument relating to
any such Debt and shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any, specified in such agreement or instrument, if the effect of such event or
condition is to accelerate the maturity of such Debt; or any such Debt shall be declared to be due and payable, or required to be prepaid or
redeemed (other than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment or redemption), purchased or defeased, or an offer to prepay, redeem,
purchase or defease such Debt shall be required to be made, in each case prior to the stated maturity thereof; or
 
(e)           The Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries shall generally not pay its debts as such debts become due, or shall admit in
writing its inability to pay its debts generally, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or any proceeding shall be instituted
by or against the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of it or its debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization or relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar
official for it or for any substantial part of its property and, in the case of any such proceeding instituted against it (but not instituted by it), either
such proceeding shall remain undismissed or unstayed for a period of 30 days, or any of the actions sought in such proceeding (including, without
limitation, the entry of an order for relief against, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for, it or for any
substantial part of its property) shall occur; or the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries shall take any corporate action to authorize any of
the actions set forth above in this subsection (e); or
 
(f)            Any judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of $500,000,000 shall be rendered against the Company or any of its
Material Subsidiaries and either (i) enforcement proceedings shall have been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or order or (ii) there
shall be any period of 10 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or
otherwise, shall not be in effect; provided, however, that any such judgment or order shall not be an Event of Default under this Section 6.01(f) if
and for so long as (i) the amount of such judgment or order is covered by a valid and binding policy of insurance between the defendant and the
insurer covering payment thereof and (ii) such insurer, which shall be rated at least “A” by A.M. Best Company (or any successor thereto), has
been notified of, and has not disputed the claim made for payment of, the amount of such judgment or order; or
 
43
 
 
(g)           Any event, action or condition with respect to an employee benefit plan of the Company subject to Title IV of ERISA results in
any penalty or action pursuant to ERISA that has a Material Adverse Effect;

obligation of each Lender to make Advances to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate and (ii) shall at the request, or may with the
consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Company declare the Advances, all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement

ARTICLE VII
THE AGENT
 
Section 7.01         Appointment and Authority.
 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank, N.A. to act on its behalf as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
and authorizes the Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together
with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Except as expressly provided herein, the provisions of this Article are solely for the
benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrowers shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and
agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Agent is not intended to
connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of
market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender
prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
 
Section 7.02         Rights as a Lender.
 
The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money
to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company or
any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
44
 
 
Section 7.03         Exculpatory Provisions.
 
(a)           The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties
hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent:
 
(i)            shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
 
(ii)           shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and
powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents);
provided that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability
or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the
automatic stay under any debtor relief law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in
violation of any debtor relief law; and
 
(iii)          shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable
for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person
serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 
(b)           The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as
provided in Sections 8.01 and 6.01), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice
describing such Default is given to the Agent in writing by the Company or a Lender.
 
(c)           The Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent.
 
Section 7.04         Reliance by Agent.
 
The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement,
instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with
any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Agent may presume that such
condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Advance.
The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not
be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
45
 
 
Section 7.05         Indemnification.
 
The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company), ratably according to the respective outstanding
principal amounts of the Advances then made by each of them (or if no Advances are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts
of their Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent’s gross negligence, willful
misconduct or material breach of this Agreement in bad faith. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly
upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Company.
 
Section 7.06         Delegation of Duties.
 
The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through
any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent and approved by the Company. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-
agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-
agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non appealable judgment that the Agent acted with gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
 
Section 7.07         Resignation of Agent.
 
(a)           The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor approved by the Company, which shall be a bank with an office in the United
States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the
Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a
successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in
accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.
 
(b)           If the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (e) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as Agent and appoint a successor
approved by the Company. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30
days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become
effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.
 
46
 
 
(c)           With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and
determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall
succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent, and the retiring or removed Agent shall
be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring or removed
Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article (and, as to the Agent, Section 8.04) shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent.
 
Section 7.08         Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on
such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or
based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
Section 7.09         Syndication Agent and Lead Arrangers.
 
Without prejudice to the obligations of the Agent hereunder, the Syndication Agent and Lead Arrangers, in their capacities as such, have no duties,
obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement.
 
Section 7.10         Certain ERISA Matters.
 
(a)           Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date
such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agent and each Lead Arranger,
and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower, that at least one of the following is and will be true:
 
(i)            such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans
with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Advances, the Commitments or this
Agreement,

company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTE
91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain
transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of
and performance of the Advances, the Commitments and this Agreement,
 
(iii)           (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of
PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in,
administer and perform the Advances, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and
performance of the Advances, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-
14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such
Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Advances, the Commitments and this Agreement, or
 
(iv)          such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Agent, in its sole discretion, and such
Lender.
 
(b)           In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has
provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x)
represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party
hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agent and each Lead Arranger, and not, for the avoidance of doubt,
to or for the benefit of any Borrower, that none of the Agent or any Lead Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates is a fiduciary with respect to the
assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Advances, the Commitments and
this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any
documents related hereto or thereto).

“PTE” means a prohibited transaction class exemption issued by the U.S. Department of Labor, as any such exemption may be amended from time
to time.

Section 7.11         Erroneous Payments.
 
(a)           If the Agent notifies a Lender, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender (any such Lender or other recipient, a
“Payment Recipient”) that the Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding clause
(b)) that any funds received by such Payment Recipient from the Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or
mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender or other Payment Recipient on its behalf) (any such funds, whether
received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually and collectively, an “Erroneous
Payment”) and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the
Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the Agent, and such Lender shall (or, with respect to any
Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days
thereafter, return to the Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in
the currency so received), together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof)
was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent in same day funds at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a
rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. A notice of the Agent to any
Payment Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
(b)           Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, hereby
further agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees,
distribution or otherwise) from the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice
of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not
preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that such Lender, or such
other recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) in each case:
 
(i)             (A) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written
confirmation from the Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case, with
respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and
 
(ii)           such Lender shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events,
within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details
thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Agent pursuant to this Section 7.11(b).
 
(c)           Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan
Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Agent to such Lender from any source, against any amount due to the Agent under immediately
preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement.
 
49
 
 
(d)           In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the
Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from
any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an “Erroneous
Payment Return Deficiency”), upon the Agent’s notice to such Lender at any time, (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Advances (but not
its Commitments) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Agent may specify) (such assignment of
such Advances (but not Commitments), the “Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment”) at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment
fee to be waived by the Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Company) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption
(or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an approved electronic platform as to
which the Agent and such parties are participants) to the Agent, as the assignee Lender, with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment,
and such Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Advances to the Borrowers or the Agent, (ii) the Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to
acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender
hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to
such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender and (iv) the Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership
interest in the Advances subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. The Agent may sell any Advances acquired pursuant to an Erroneous
Payment Deficiency Assignment in accordance with Section 8.07 hereof (pursuant to which the prior written consent of the Company is required for any
such sale (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)), and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return
Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Advance (or portion thereof), and the Agent shall retain
all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of
doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Agent has sold an Advance (or portion
thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Agent
shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment
Return Deficiency (the “Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights”).
 
(e)           The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any obligations owed by
any Borrower, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, or any portion of such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the
amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Agent from any Borrower for the purpose of making a payment,
prepayment, repayment, discharge or satisfaction in respect of the obligations under any Loan Document. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (d) above and
this clause (e) shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the
obligations of any Borrower relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the obligations of any Borrower that would have been payable had the
Erroneous Payment not been made by the Agent.
 
(f)            To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby
waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by
the Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any
similar doctrine
 
(g)           Each party’s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 7.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent, any
transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of
all obligations of any Borrower (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

(b)           The Company agrees that the Agent may make any written information, documents, instruments and other written materials that
have been provided to the Agent pursuant to the terms hereof (collectively, the “Communications”) available to the Lenders by posting such
notices on Intralinks or a substantially similar electronic system (the “Platform”). The Company acknowledges that (i) the distribution of material
through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution, (ii) the
Platform is provided “as is” and “as available” and (iii) neither the Agent nor any of its Affiliates warrants the accuracy, adequacy or completeness

hours specifying that any Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such information, documents or
other materials to such Lender for purposes of this Agreement; provided that if requested by any Lender the Agent shall deliver a copy of the

which a Notice may be sent by electronic transmission (including by electronic communication) on or before the date such Lender becomes a
party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter to ensure that the Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such Lender) and
(ii) that any Notice may be sent to such e-mail address.
 
Section 8.03         No Waiver; Remedies.
 
No failure on the part of any Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
 
Section 8.04         Costs and Expenses.
 
(a)           The Company agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if any (including,

expenses of counsel for the Agent and each Lender in connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 8.04(a).
 
52
 
 
(b)           The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their officers,
directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an “Indemnified Party”) from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any
Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of, or in connection with the preparation for a defense of, any
investigation, litigation or proceeding arising out of, related to or in connection with the Notes, this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances, whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is
brought by any Borrower, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is
otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, except to the extent such claim, damage,
loss, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified
Party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement in bad faith.
 
None of the Agent, any Lender or any of their Affiliates or their officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, a “Lender-
Related Party”) shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or
other similar information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement. No party hereto or any other Lender Related Party shall have
any liability to any other party hereto for any indirect, punitive or consequential damages relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document

(c)           If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Term SOFR Advance or any Eurocurrency Rate Advance is made by any
Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of a payment or
Conversion pursuant to Section 2.08(d) or (e), 2.10 or 2.12, acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other
reason, or if any Term SOFR Advance or Eurocurrency Rate Advance is assigned on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period therefor
as a result of a request by Company pursuant to Section 2.05 or 8.07, the Company shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such
demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses,
costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or Conversion, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.
 
(d)           Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Company contained in Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 8.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder
and under the Notes and the termination of this Agreement.
 
Section 8.05         Right of Set-off.
 
Upon (i) the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the granting of the consent
specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent to declare the Advances due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, each Lender and each
of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or such Affiliate to or
for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any and all of the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and
the Note held by such Lender, whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note and although such obligations
may be unmatured, provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over
immediately to the Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.19 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such
Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide
promptly to the Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of
setoff. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Company after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender and its Affiliates may have.
 
53
 
 
Section 8.06         Binding Effect.
 
This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, each
Borrowing Subsidiary (if any), the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that other than in accordance with Section
5.02(b), the Company shall not assign its rights and obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders.
 
Section 8.07         Assignments and Participations.
 
(a)           Each Lender may, upon ten days’ notice to the Agent and with the prior consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and, if demanded by the Company pursuant to Section 2.05 (b) or 2.06(b), upon at least 20 Business Days’
notice to such Lender and the Agent, will assign to one or more Persons all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however,
that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement, (ii) except in
the case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender or an affiliate of a Lender, or an assignment of all
of a Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each
such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than
$10,000,000, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Company
pursuant to this Section 8.07(a) shall be arranged by the Company after consultation with the Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the
rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made
concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender
under this Agreement, (v) no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by the Company pursuant to this
Section 8.07(a) unless and until such Lender shall have received one or more payments from either the Company or one or more Eligible
Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together
with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement,
(vi) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register (as defined in
clause (d) below), an Assignment and Assumption, together with any Note requested pursuant to Section 2.13(e) subject to such assignment and a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (vii) the Eligible Assignee shall complete, execute and deliver to the Borrowers and Agent the
appropriate tax form pursuant to Section 2.14. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption and upon compliance with clause (vii) of the previous sentence, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have
been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto); provided that an assigning Lender’s rights to indemnification and reimbursement
pursuant to Section 8.04 and its rights and obligations under Sections 2.11 and 2.14 shall survive assignment hereunder.
 
54
 
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose vehicle (an
“SPV”) of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Agent and the Company, the option
to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers
pursuant to Section 2.01, provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Advance, (ii) if an SPV elects
not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such
Advance pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Borrowers may bring any proceeding against either the Granting Lender or the SPV in order to
enforce any rights of the Borrowers hereunder. The making of an Advance by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting
Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Advance were made by the Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable
for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Lender
makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior
indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof arising out of
any claim against such SPV under this Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, any SPV may
with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Company or the Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a
portion of its interests in any Advances to its Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Company and the Agent)
providing liquidity and/or credit support (if any) with respect to commercial paper issued by such SPV to fund such Advances and such SPV may
disclose, on a confidential basis, confidential information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to any rating agency, commercial paper
dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit liquidity enhancement to such SPV. This paragraph may not be amended without the consent of
any SPV at the time holding Advances under this Agreement.
 
(b)           By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm
to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Assumption, such assigning
Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or
in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to
the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with
copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its
own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon
the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible
Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and
discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.
 
55
 
 
(c)           Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an
Eligible Assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Assumption has been
completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption, (ii) record the information contained
therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Company. The relevant Borrower, at its own expense, shall if so requested
pursuant to Section 2.13(e) execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note a new Note to the order of such Eligible
Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption and, if the assigning Lender has
retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it
hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or
Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Assumption and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.
 
(d)           The Agent acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the relevant Borrower shall maintain at its address referred to
in Section 8.02 if such address is within the United States and, if not, at one of its offices located within the United States a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and, with
respect to Lenders, the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the “Register”). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and each Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available
for inspection by the Company or any Lender, as to its Commitment, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
56
 
 
(e)           Each Lender may, with the prior consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), upon
notice to the Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than the Company or any Affiliate of the Company) in or to all
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances
owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, its Commitment hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers,
the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such
amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each
case to the extent subject to such participation, postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or
other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation or release the Company from its obligations hereunder,
including, without limitation, its obligations under Article IX. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a
nonfiduciary agent of the relevant Borrower, maintain a register at one of its offices located within the United States on which it enters the name
and address of each participant and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each participant from time to time (the
“Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person
(including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its
other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter
of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the
Participant Register shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement.
 
(f)            Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this
Section 8.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any information relating to any Borrower furnished to such
Lender by or on behalf of any Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information relating to the Borrowers received by it from such Lender.
 
(g)           Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it), in favor
of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other central bank
having jurisdiction over such Lender.
 
Section 8.08         Confidentiality.
 
Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall disclose any Confidential Information to any Person without the consent of the Company, other than (a) to
the Agent’s or such Lender’s Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors and to actual or prospective assignees and participants,
and then only on a confidential basis, (b) as required by any law, rule or regulation or judicial process, (c) to any rating agency when required by it,
provided that, prior to any such disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information relating to the
Borrowers received by it from such Lender, (d) as requested or required by any state, federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating banks or banking
or any regulatory authority (including any self-regulatory authority), (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder and (f) disclosures of information pertaining to this Agreement of the sort
routinely provided by arrangers to data service providers, including league table providers, that serve the lending industry; provided that such disclosure is
limited to information identifying the Company, the type, amount and maturity of the credit facility established hereby and the roles and titles of the Lead
Arrangers, Agent and Syndication Agent named on the cover hereof (and excluding any confidential information relating to the business of the Company).
 
57
 
 
In addition, the Agent may disclose to any agency or organization that assigns standard identification numbers to loan facilities such basic
information describing the facilities provided hereunder as is necessary to assign unique identifiers (and, if requested, supply a copy of this Agreement), it
being understood that the Person to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and instructed to make
available to the public only such information as such person normally makes available in the course of its business of assigning identification numbers.

FORM OF NOTE
 
U.S.$__________
 
Dated: __________, 20__
 
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, PEPSICO, INC., a North Carolina corporation (the “Borrower”), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY to
the order of _____________________ (the “Lender”) for the account of its Applicable Lending Office on the later of the Termination Date and the
Maturity Date (each as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below) the principal amount of the Advances made by the Lender to the Borrower
pursuant to the 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of May 26, 2023 among the Borrower, the Lender and certain other lenders parties thereto, and
Citibank, N.A., as Agent for the Lender and such other lenders (as amended or modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”; the terms defined
therein being used herein as therein defined) outstanding on the later of the Termination Date and the Maturity Date.
 
The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from the date of such Advance until such principal amount
is paid in full, at such interest rates, and payable at such times, as are specified in the Credit Agreement.
 
Both principal and interest in respect of each Advance (i) denominated in Dollars are payable in lawful money of the United States of America and
(ii) denominated in Euros are payable in such currency, in each case to Citibank, N.A., as Agent, at the Agent’s Account, in same day funds for the account
of the Lender. Each Advance owing to the Lender by the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and all payments made on account of principal
thereof, shall be recorded by the Lender and, prior to any transfer hereof, endorsed on the grid attached hereto which is part of this Promissory Note. Each
such endorsement shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information so endorsed.
 
This Promissory Note is one of the Notes referred to in, and is entitled to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement, among
other things, (i) provides for the making of Advances by the Lender to the Borrower from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time
outstanding the U.S. dollar amount first above mentioned, the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from each such Advance being evidenced by this
Promissory Note, (ii) contains provisions for determining the Equivalent in Dollars for Advances denominated in Euros and (iii) contains provisions for
acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the happening of certain stated events and also for prepayments on account of principal hereof prior to the maturity
hereof upon the terms and conditions therein specified.
 
The Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights
hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of such rights.
 
 
 
 
This Promissory Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE ADVANCES
 
Section 2.01      The Revolving Credit Advances.
 
Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Revolving Credit Advances in Dollars and/or Euros to the
Company and any Borrowing Subsidiary from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the Termination Date in an
aggregate amount (based in respect of any Revolving Credit Advances to be denominated in Euros by reference to the Equivalent thereof in Dollars
determined on the date of delivery of the applicable Notice of Borrowing) not to exceed such Lender’s Unused Revolving Credit Commitment. Each
Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of the Borrowing Minimum or an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple in excess
thereof and shall consist of Revolving Credit Advances of the same Type and in the same currency made on the same day by the Lenders ratably according
to their respective Revolving Credit Commitments. Within the limits of each Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment, each Borrower may borrow under
this Section 2.01, prepay pursuant to Section 2.10 and reborrow under this Section 2.01.
 
Section 2.02      Making the Revolving Credit Advances.
 
(a)            Each Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than (x) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
third U.S. Government Securities Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing in the case of a Revolving Credit
Borrowing consisting of Term SOFR Advances, (y) 4:00 P.M. (London time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed
Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances or (z) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of the
proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances, by the Company (on its
own behalf and on behalf of any Borrowing Subsidiary) to the Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier or
email. Each such notice of a Revolving Credit Borrowing (a “Notice of Borrowing”) shall be by e-mail, confirmed promptly in writing, in
substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances
constituting such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (iv) in the case of a Revolving Credit
Borrowing consisting of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the currency and initial Interest Period for each such Revolving
Credit Advance and (v) name of the relevant Borrower (which shall be the Company or a Borrowing Subsidiary). Each Lender shall, before 1:00
P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to
the Agent at the applicable Agent’s Account, in same day funds, such Lender’s ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing. After the
Agent’s receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such same day funds
available to the relevant Borrower at such Borrower’s account at the Agent’s address referred to in Section 8.02; provided, however, that, if such
Borrowing is denominated in Euro, the Agent shall first make a portion of such funds equal to the aggregate principal amount of Swing Line
Advances made to such Borrower by the Swing Line Lenders and by any other Lender and outstanding on the date of such Revolving Credit
Borrowing, plus interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of such date, available to the Swing Line Lenders and the other Lenders for
repayment of such Swing Line Advances.
 
  16  
 
 
(b)            Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Company may not select Term SOFR Advances or
Eurocurrency Rate Advances for any Revolving Credit Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Borrowing is less than the
Borrowing Minimum or if the obligation of the Lenders to make Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, as applicable, shall then
be suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.12 and (ii) the Term SOFR Advances and Eurocurrency Rate Advances may not be outstanding as part
of more than twelve separate Revolving Credit Borrowings.
 
(c)            Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the relevant Borrower. In the case of any Revolving Credit
Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the
Company shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure by the applicable
Borrower to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Revolving Credit Borrowing the applicable conditions set
forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or
other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Revolving Credit
Borrowing when such Revolving Credit Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.
 
(d)            Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such
Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender’s ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this
Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.
If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and such Borrower severally
agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of
Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in
Euros. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Credit
Advance as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement and shall be made available in same day funds to the relevant
Borrower’s account at the Agent’s address referred to in Section 8.02.
 
(e)            The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing
shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit
Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such other
Lender on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing.
 
Section 2.03      [Reserved].
 
Section 2.04      Fees.

outstanding and (B) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments, the aggregate Swing Line Commitments

effective date of such Lender’s Commitment termination, an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing

(iii)            Not later than the date five days after the Increase Notice Date, the Agent shall notify each New Lender, if any,

A.M. (New York City time) on the date that is 10 days after the Increase Notice Date; provided that:

Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder on such date), and shall pay to the Agent a processing and recordation fee of

thereto, the Revolving Credit Advances (including, without limitation, the Types and Interest Periods thereof) shall be
held by the Lenders (including for such purposes New Lenders) ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving
Credit Commitments. If any Swing Line Advances are outstanding on any Increase Date, participations in such Swing
Line Advances shall be deemed to be reallocated on such date according to the respective Revolving Credit
Commitments of the Lenders after giving effect to such Total Committed Increase.
 
(2)            If the Total Committed Increase is less than $25,000,000, then the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments shall not be changed pursuant to this Section 2.05(c).
 
(vi)            The Total Committed Increase shall be allocated among New Lenders having Proposed New Commitments and
Lenders having Proposed Increased Commitments, if any, as follows:
 
(1)            If the Total Committed Increase shall be at least $25,000,000 and less than or equal to the Proposed
Aggregate Commitment Increase, then (x) the initial Commitment of each New Lender shall be such New Lender’s Proposed
New Commitment and (y) the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Lender shall be increased by such Lender’s Proposed
Increased Commitment, if any.
 
(2)            If the Total Committed Increase shall be greater than the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then the
Total Committed Increase shall be allocated:
 
(x)            first to New Lenders (to the extent of their respective Proposed New Commitments) in such a
manner as the Company shall agree; and
 
(y)            then to Lenders on a pro rata basis based on the ratio of each Lender’s Proposed Increased
Commitment (if any) to the aggregate amount of the Proposed Increased Commitments of all of the Lenders.

have received (x) Revolving Credit Notes payable to each New Lender and each other Lender whose Revolving Credit Commitment is
being increased to the extent such New Lender or Lender has requested such a Revolving Credit Note pursuant to Section 2.13(e), and
(y) evidence satisfactory to the Agent (including an update of the opinion of counsel provided pursuant to Section 3.01(f)(iv)) that such
increases in the Revolving Credit Commitments, and borrowings thereunder, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and

as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day), (ii) the Termination Date for any Declining Lenders not replaced shall be the Existing
Termination Date and (iii) all Advances and other amounts payable hereunder to such Declining Lenders shall become due and payable on the

Commitment of such Declining Lenders so terminated on the Existing Termination Date and, if any Declining Lender is a Swing Line Lender, the
total Swing Line Commitments of the Swing Line Lenders hereunder shall be reduced by the Swing Line Commitment of such Declining Lenders

Borrower from the date of such Swing Line Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full at a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of
(x) the Overnight Rate in effect from time to time plus (y) 0.625%, payable in arrears on the date such Swing Line Advance shall be, or shall be required to
be, paid in full. For the period from the date of such Swing Line Borrowing and ending on the date the Lenders fund their participations in such Swing Line
Advance in accordance with Section 2.20(d), such interest shall be for the sole account of the Swing Line Lenders.
 
(c)            Default Rate. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.01(a), the principal of and,
to the extent permitted by law, interest on the Advances and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (including without
limitation fees and expenses) shall bear interest, payable on demand, at the Default Rate.
 
Section 2.08      Interest Rate Determination.
 
(a)            The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for
purposes of Section 2.07.
 
(b)            If, due to a major disruption in the interbank funding market with respect to any Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate
Advances, the Required Lenders notify the Agent that the Adjusted Term SOFR or the EURIBO Rate, as applicable, for any Interest Period for
such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Term SOFR
Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrowers and the Lenders, whereupon
(i) each Term SOFR Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance,
(ii) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance and
(iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Revolving Credit Advances into, Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances
shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
 
  22  
 
 
(c)            If the Company shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate
Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of “Interest Period” in Section 1.01, the Agent will forthwith so notify the
Company and the Lenders and the Company will be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month.
 
(d)            On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances
constituting any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than the Borrowing Minimum, such Advances shall
automatically (i) if such Advances are Term SOFR Advances, Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Advances are Eurocurrency Rate
Advances, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into Base Rate Advances.
  
(e)            If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the
Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing, (i) each Term SOFR Advance and each Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall
automatically (A) if such Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate
Advance, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to
make, or to Convert Advances into, Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended.
 
(f)            If (x) Term SOFR cannot be determined in accordance with the definition thereof, (y) the EURIBO Rate does not appear
Bloomberg, Thompson Reuters or on another nationally recognized service selected by the Agent or the Sub-Agent, or (z) the Overnight Rate
cannot be determined in accordance with the definition thereof,
 
(i)            the Agent shall forthwith notify the Company and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for the
applicable Advances,
 
(ii)            each such affected Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor (A) if such
Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, be
prepaid by the applicable Borrower or be automatically exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base
Rate Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and
 
(iii)            the obligation of the Lenders to make, or Convert Revolving Credit Advances into, Term SOFR Advances,
Eurocurrency Rate Advances or Swing Line Advances, as applicable, shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the
Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
 
  23  
 
 
Section 2.09      Optional Conversion or Continuation of Revolving Credit Advances.
 
The Company may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third U.S.
Government Securities Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion or continuation, and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08, 2.12 and
2.18, Convert all or any part of the Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Dollars of one Type constituting the same Borrowing into Revolving Credit
Advances denominated in Dollars of another Type or continue all or any part of the Advance of one Type constituting the same Borrowing or Advances of
the same Type and in the same currency; provided, however, that any Conversion of Term SOFR Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made only on
the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Term SOFR Advances shall be in an amount
not less than the Borrowing Minimum and no Conversion of any Revolving Credit Advances shall result in more separate Revolving Credit Borrowings
than permitted under Section 2.02(b). Each such notice of a Conversion or continuation shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of
such Conversion or continuation, (ii) the Dollar denominated Revolving Credit Advances to be Converted or continued, and (iii) if such Conversion is into
Term SOFR Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Advance. Each notice of Conversion or continuation shall be irrevocable and
binding on the Company.
 
Section 2.10      Prepayments of Revolving Credit Advances.
 
(a)            Optional. The Company may, upon at least three U.S. Government Securities Business Days’ notice, in the case of Term SOFR
Advances, three Business Days’ notice, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, to the Agent and one Business Day’s notice in the case of any
Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Advances to (i) the Agent or (ii) the Sub-Agent in the case of any Swing Line Advances, in
each case stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Company shall, prepay the
outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances constituting part of the same Revolving Credit Borrowing or such Swing Line
Advances comprising the same Swing Line Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on
the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of the Borrowing
Minimum or a Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof in the case of Revolving Credit Advances and in an aggregate principal amount of
€10,000,000 in the case of Swing Line Advances and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a Term SOFR Advance or a Eurocurrency Rate
Advance, the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(c).
 
(b)            Mandatory. (i)  If, on any date, the Agent notifies the Company in accordance with clause (iii) below that, as of the most recent
interest payment date, the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars then outstanding plus (B) the
Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to such interest payment date) of the aggregate principal amount of all
Advances denominated in Euros then outstanding exceeds 105% of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments on such date, the Borrowers
shall, as soon as practicable and in any event within five Business Days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of
any Advances in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate Revolving Credit
Commitments on such date (subject to the proviso to this sentence set forth below), together with any interest accrued to the date of such
prepayment on the aggregate principal amount of Advances prepaid; provided that if the aggregate principal amount of Base Rate Advances
outstanding at the time of such required prepayment is less than the amount of such required prepayment, the portion of such required prepayment
in excess of the aggregate principal amount of Base Rate Advances then outstanding shall be deferred until the last day of the next maturing
Interest Period of the outstanding Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, in an aggregate amount equal to the excess of such
required prepayment. The Agent shall give prompt notice of any prepayment required under this Section 2.10(b) to the Company in accordance
with clause (iii) below and the Lenders.
 
  24  
 
 
(ii)            Each prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall be made together with any interest accrued to the date of such
prepayment on the principal amounts prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a Term SOFR Advance or a Eurocurrency Rate Advance on a
date other than the last day of an Interest Period, any additional amounts which the applicable Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse to the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(c).
 
(iii)            The Agent shall calculate on the date of each Notice of Borrowing and on each interest payment date the sum of (A) the
aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior
to the date such calculation is required under this clause (iii)) of the aggregate principal amount of all Eurocurrency Rate Advances and shall give
prompt notice (and in any event no later than thirty days) of any prepayment required in connection with an interest payment date under this
Section 2.10(b) to the Company and the Lenders.
 
Section 2.11      Increased Costs.
 
(a)            If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation or administration of any
law or regulation by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or (ii) the compliance with any guideline
or request from any central bank or other governmental authority that would be complied with generally by similarly situated banks acting
reasonably (whether or not having the force of law and for the avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines
or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued after the date hereof in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act or promulgated after the date hereof by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III), there
shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate
Advances (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 2.11(b) other than as set forth below) by an amount deemed by such Lender to
be material, then the Company shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent
for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of
such increased cost, submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.
 
(b)            If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental or regulatory authority which becomes effective after the date hereof (for the
avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued
after the date hereof in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or promulgated after the date hereof by
the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or
foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, there shall be any increase in the amount of capital or liquidity required or
expected to be maintained by any Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased
by or based upon the existence of such Lender’s Advances or commitment to lend and other commitments of this type by an amount deemed by
such Lender to be material, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Company shall pay to the Agent for
the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such
corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be
allocable to the existence of such Lender’s Advances or commitment to lend hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Company
and the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes as to the calculations therein, absent manifest error. Such certificate
shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender’s
treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in
circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.
 
  25  
 
 
Section 2.12      Illegality.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent (and provide to the Company an opinion of counsel to
the effect) that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other
governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Term
SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances hereunder, (a) each Term
SOFR Advance or each Eurocurrency Rate Advance, as applicable, made by such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, (i) if such Advance is a
Term SOFR Advance, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, be exchanged into an Equivalent
amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate
Advances, as applicable, or to Convert Advances into Term SOFR Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders
that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
 
Section 2.13      Payments and Computations; Evidence of Advances.
 
(a)            The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, except with respect to principal or, interest on, and
other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in Euros, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the
Agent at the applicable Agent’s Account in same day funds without deduction, off-set or counterclaim except as provided in Section 2.14. The
Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to,
Advances denominated in Euros, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Euros to the Agent at the applicable
Agent’s Account in same day funds without deduction, off-set or counterclaim except as provided in Section 2.14. The Agent will promptly
thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest, commitment fees ratably (other than amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.05(b), 2.06(b), 2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices,
and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office,
in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Assumption and recording of
the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and
Assumption, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee
thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such
effective date directly between themselves.
 
  26  
 
 
(b)            All computations of interest based on the Base Rate (determined pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof) and of
commitment fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based
on Adjusted Term SOFR, the EURIBO Rate, the Overnight Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Agent or the Sub-Agent, as the
case may be, on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
(c)            Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Term
SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next
preceding Business Day.
 
(d)            Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders
hereunder that a Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the
Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal
to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender
shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of
Advances denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in
Euros.
  
(e)            The Advances made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by
the Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent
manifest error of the amount of the Advances made by the Lenders to a Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record
or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of a Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect
to the Advances. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any
Lender made through the Agent, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Agent) a Revolving Credit Note which shall
evidence such Lender's Advances in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note or Notes and endorse
thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Advances and payments with respect thereto.
 
  27  
 
 
(f)            To the extent that the Agent receives funds for application to the amounts owing by any Borrower under or in respect of this
Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders in
accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13, the Agent shall be entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into Euros or from
Dollars to Euros or from Euros to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to enable the Agent to distribute such funds in accordance
with the terms of this Section 2.13; provided that each Borrower and each of the Lenders hereby agree that the Agent shall not be liable or
responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Borrower or such Lender as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies
affected pursuant to this Section 2.13(f) or as a result of the failure of the Agent to effect any such conversion or exchange; and provided further
that such Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and hold the Agent and each Lender harmless, for any and all losses, costs and
expenses incurred by the Agent or any Lender for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any currencies)
in accordance with this Section 2.13(f).
 
(g)            In connection with the use or administration of any Benchmark, the Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes
from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become
effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. The Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Lenders
of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of any Benchmark.
 
Section 2.14      Taxes.
 
(a)            Each Lender is exempt from any withholding tax imposed under the laws of the United States in respect of any fees, interest or
other payments to which it is entitled pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes (the “Income”) because (i) the Lender is a United States Person; (ii) the
Income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States within the meaning of Section 871 of the Internal Revenue
Code; or (iii) the Income is eligible for an exemption by reason of a tax treaty. The Agent is exempt from any withholding tax imposed under the laws of
the United States in respect of the Income because the Agent is a United States Person.
 
(b)            Each Lender that is a United States Person shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time
thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any successor or other form provided by the Internal Revenue Service. Each Lender that is not a United States
Person (each, a “Foreign Lender”) shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the
Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-
8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-8IMY (accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-9 or other certification
documents from each beneficial owner, as appropriate), as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service,
certifying that such Foreign Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on any Income that is the subject of such
forms. If the relevant Borrower determines, based on the form provided by a Foreign Lender (or the failure to provide such a form) at the time such Foreign
Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement that a United States withholding tax rate in excess of zero applies to payments made by such Borrower to
the Foreign Lender under this Agreement, such Borrower shall be permitted to deduct amounts from payments to such Foreign Lender to the extent
required to pay withholding tax at such rate, and such amounts shall be considered excluded from Taxes as defined in Section 2.14(c); provided, however,
that, if on the date of the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which a Foreign Lender becomes a Foreign Lender, pursuant to the Assignment and
Assumption provisions of Article VIII, the Foreign Lender assignor was entitled to payments under Section 2.14(c) in respect of United States withholding
tax paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to Taxes that are imposed pursuant to a Change in Law (defined below)
after the date of Assignment and Assumption) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Foreign Lender assignee on such date.
For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of any Borrower under Section 2.14 of this Agreement shall not be increased as the result of any assignment
pursuant to Article VIII of this Agreement with respect to United States withholding tax; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the obligation
of any Borrower in respect of Taxes imposed as the result of any Change in Law after the date of the relevant Assignment and Assumption.
 
  28  
 
 
(c)            Except as set forth in Section 2.14(b) or as required by applicable law, any and all payments by any Borrower hereunder or
under the Notes shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any withholding taxes imposed on a Lender (such withholding taxes being
hereinafter referred to as “Taxes”, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall exclude any Excluded Taxes). If any Borrower is required to deduct any Taxes
from or in respect of any Income, then: (i) the sum payable to such Lender shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
deductions for such Taxes (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14) such Lender receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of
Taxes by the Company pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02,
the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Borrower shall be entitled to pay any Taxes in
any lawful manner so as to reduce any deductions and such Lender shall to the extent it is reasonably able provide any documentation or file any forms as
may be required by the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental agency. In addition, if any Lender or the Agent (in lieu of such Lender), as the
case may be, is required to pay directly any Taxes because a Borrower cannot or does not legally or timely do so, the Company shall indemnify such
Lender or Agent for payment of such Taxes, without duplication of, or increase in, the amount in respect of Taxes otherwise due to the Lender.
 
(d)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, the sum payable to a Lender shall not be increased, and no indemnification payments shall be
made, pursuant to Section 2.14(c) with respect to any United States federal withholding taxes any Borrower is required to deduct from or in respect of any
Income, except to the extent that (i) such Borrower is required to deduct such taxes as a result of the enactment, promulgation, execution or ratification of,
or any change in or amendment to, any United States law or any tax treaty (or in the application or official interpretation of any law or any tax treaty) that
occurs after the date a Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement (a “Change in Law”) or (ii) such taxes are “Taxes” solely as a result of the
application of the proviso to the penultimate sentence of Section 2.14(b).
 
(e)            In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes,
charges or similar levies (excluding any income or franchise taxes, business taxes or capital taxes of any nature) that arise from the execution or delivery, or
otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”). If a Lender is required to pay directly Other Taxes
because a Borrower cannot or does not legally or timely do so, the Company shall indemnify such Lender for such payment of Other Taxes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.14, each Lender shall upon the written request of and at the expense of the Company use
reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, any such Other Taxes that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause imposition on such Lender of any
material legal or regulatory burdens.
 
  29  
 
 
(f)            To the extent any Lender is entitled to any exemption or reduction of foreign withholding taxes, each Lender shall cooperate
with each Borrower by providing to the extent reasonably within its means any forms requested by such Borrower substantiating such reduction or
exemption from such foreign withholding taxes required by any governmental agency.
 
(g)            For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) or (f) relating to
certain forms intended to reduce withholding taxes (other than if such failure is due to a Change in Law that makes compliance with subsection (b) or
(f) unduly burdensome in the reasonable judgment of such Lender), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 2.14.
 
(h)            Upon a Change in Law or the imposition of any Taxes, a Lender shall, upon the written request of and at the expense of the
Company, use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, any such Taxes that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause the imposition on such
Lender of any material legal or regulatory burdens.
 
(i)            Any request by any Lender for payment of any amount under this Section 2.14 shall be accompanied by a certification that such
Lender’s claim for said amount is generally consistent with such Lender’s treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with
such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any
confidential or proprietary information therein.
 
(j)            If any Lender shall become aware, including by means of a request by the Company, that it is entitled to receive a refund
(including, for all purposes of this subsection (j), any refund in the form of a credit from the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes or Other Taxes) in respect of
Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.14, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall, within 30 days after
receipt of a request by the Company (whether as a result of notification that it has made to a Borrower or otherwise) to seek such refund, make a claim for
such refund at such Borrower’s expense. No Lender shall seek a refund without such approval by a Borrower. If a Lender receives a refund in respect of
any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.14, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of such refund and shall within 30 days from the date of receipt of
such refund pay over the amount of such refund to such Borrower to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower
under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund plus any interest paid or credited with respect to such refund, net
of all out-of-pocket expenses and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from one to another currency incurred by the Agent of
such Lender; provided that the applicable Borrower, upon the request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed with respect to such Taxes or Other Taxes by the relevant governmental agency) to the Agent or such
Lender in the event the Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such governmental agency. This subsection shall not be construed to
require the Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to any
Borrower or any other Person.
 
  30  
 
 
(k)            If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by
FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or
1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at
such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as may be
necessary for the Borrowers and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such
Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this subsection (k),
“FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
(l)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 2.14 shall be the only provisions
requiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bear the cost of (or arising from) any taxes otherwise borne by any Lender. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, “taxes” includes any tax, governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
withholding on amounts paid to or by the Company or its Subsidiaries), together with any interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed
with respect thereto.
 
Section 2.15      Sharing of Payments, Etc.
 
If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of
the Revolving Credit Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.05(b), 2.06(b), 2.11, 2.14, 8.04(c) or 8.07), or the participations in Swing Line
Advances held by it, in excess of its ratable share thereof, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Revolving
Credit Advances and subparticipations in the Swing Line Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the
excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the
extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s
required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing
Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation or subparticipation from another
Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect
to such participation or subparticipation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation or
subparticipation.
 
Section 2.16      Use of Proceeds.
 
The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and the Company agrees that such proceeds shall be used) for general corporate purposes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, including but not limited to working capital, capital investments and acquisitions. No Borrower shall knowingly use the
proceeds of any Advance to fund any activities or business (a) of or with any individual or entity that is included on the SDN List or (b) in, or with the
government of, any Sanctioned Country, except in the case of (a) or (b) to the extent licensed by OFAC or otherwise permissible under U.S. law.

Section 2.17      Borrowings by Borrowing Subsidiaries.
 
(a)            The Company may, at any time or from time to time upon not less than 10 Business Days’ notice in the case of any Subsidiary
so designated after the Effective Date, designate one or more Subsidiaries as Borrowers hereunder by furnishing to the Agent a letter (a
“Designation Letter”) in duplicate, in substantially the form of Exhibit D, duly completed and executed by the Company and such Subsidiary. The
Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Company’s notice of such pending designation by the Company and the identity of the Subsidiary.
Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 2.17(a), if the designation of such Subsidiary obligates the Agent or any Lender to
comply with “know your customer” or similar identification procedures (including without limitation the Beneficial Ownership Regulation) in
circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of the Agent or any
Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lender in order for the Agent or such
Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary “know your customer” or other similar checks under all
applicable laws and regulations. Upon any such designation of a Subsidiary, such Subsidiary shall be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a Borrower
entitled to borrow Revolving Credit Advances on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
 
If the Company shall designate as a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State
thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Agent and the Company, fulfill its Commitment(s) by causing an Affiliate or a branch of such Lender
to act as the Lender in respect of such Borrowing Subsidiary.
 
As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Agent of the Company’s intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Borrowing
Subsidiary, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice, if such Borrowing Subsidiary is organized under the
laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for
the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Borrowing Subsidiary directly or through an Affiliate or a branch of such Lender as
provided in the immediately preceding paragraph (a “Protesting Lender”) shall so notify the Company and the Agent in writing. With respect to
each Protesting Lender, the Company shall, effective on or before the date that such Borrowing Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow
hereunder, either (A) notify the Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated; provided
that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances, accrued interest thereon,
accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee Lender (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Borrowing Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts), or (B) cancel its request to designate
such Subsidiary as a “Borrowing Subsidiary” hereunder.
 
(b)            If all principal of and interest on all Advances made to any Borrowing Subsidiary have been paid in full, the Company may
terminate the status of such Borrowing Subsidiary as a Borrower hereunder by furnishing to the Agent a letter (a “Termination Letter”) in
substantially the form of Exhibit E, duly completed and executed by the Company. Any Termination Letter furnished hereunder shall be effective
upon receipt by the Agent, which shall promptly notify the Lenders, whereupon the Lenders shall, upon payment in full of all amounts owing by
such Borrower hereunder, promptly deliver to the Company (through the Agent) the Notes, if any, of such former Borrower. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the delivery of a Termination Letter with respect to any Borrower shall not terminate (i) any obligation of such Borrower that remains
unpaid at the time of such delivery (including without limitation any obligation arising thereafter in respect of such Borrower under Section 2.11
or 2.14) or (ii) the obligations of the Company under Article IX with respect to any such unpaid obligations; provided that if the status of such
Borrowing Subsidiary has been terminated as aforesaid because the Company has sold or transferred its interest in such Subsidiary, and the
Company so certifies to the Agent at the time of the delivery of such Termination Letter, and subject to payment of said principal and interest,
(A) such Subsidiary shall automatically, upon the effectiveness of the delivery of such Termination Letter and certification, cease to have any
obligation under this Agreement or the Notes and (B) the Company shall automatically be deemed to have unconditionally assumed, as primary
obligor, and hereby agrees to pay and perform, all of such obligations.

Section 2.18      Benchmark Replacement Setting.
 
(a)            Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark
Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to any setting of any Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement
is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark
Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent
Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and the
definition of “Adjusted Term SOFR” shall be deemed modified to delete clause (b) for any calculation of Term SOFR and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement
is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark
Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00
p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any
amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Agent has not received, by
such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. If the Benchmark Replacement is
Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.
 
(b)            Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the
Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amendments
implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.
 
(c)            Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of (i) any
Benchmark Replacement Date and the related Benchmark Replacement, (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes, (iii) the removal or
reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (d) below and (iv) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability
Period. For the avoidance of doubt, any notice required to be delivered by the Agent as set forth in this Section 2.18 may be provided, at the option of the
Agent (in its sole discretion), in one or more notices and may be delivered together with, or as part of any amendment which implements any Benchmark
Replacement or Conforming Changes. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of
Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.18, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an
event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error
and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement, except, in each case, as expressly required
pursuant to this Section 2.18.
 
(d)            Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time (including in connection
with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate or the
EURIBO Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to
time as selected by the Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public
statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Agent may modify
the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor
that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a
Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including
a Benchmark Replacement), then the Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such
previously removed tenor.
 
  33  
 
 
(e)            Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Company’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability
Period with respect to a given Benchmark, (i) the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Term SOFR Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Term SOFR Advances, or a Borrowing of, or continuation of, Eurocurrency Rate Advances, in each case, to be made, converted or
continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period denominated in the applicable Available Currency and, failing that, (A) in the case of any request
for any affected Term SOFR Borrowing, if applicable, the applicable Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Base
Rate Borrowing or conversion to Base Rate Advances in the amount specified therein and (B) in the case of any request for any affected Eurocurrency Rate
Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, then such request shall be ineffective and (ii)(A) any outstanding affected Term SOFR Advances, if applicable, will
be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Advances at the end of the applicable Interest Period and (B) any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate
Advances, at the applicable Borrower’s election, shall either (I) be converted into Base Rate Advances denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the
Dollar Equivalent thereof) at the end of the applicable Interest Period or (II) be prepaid in full at the end of the applicable Interest Period; provided that,
with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Advance, if no election is made by the applicable Borrower by the earlier of (x) the date that is three Business Days
after receipt by such Borrower of such notice and (y) the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Advance, such
Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (I) above. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued
interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 8.04(c). During a Benchmark
Unavailability Period with respect to any Benchmark or at any time that a tenor for any then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component
of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark that is the subject of such Benchmark Unavailability Period or such tenor for such Benchmark, as

for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by
the Relevant Governmental Body or (b) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for calculating
or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for syndicated

administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or
 
(3)            a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published

used in the calculation thereof).
 
“Benchmark Unavailability Period” means, with respect to any then-current Benchmark for any Available Currency, the period (if any)

Section 2.19      Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a)            Defaulting Lender Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes
a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
(i)            Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.
 
(ii)            Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent
hereunder for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VI or otherwise) or
received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 8.05 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by
the Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder; second, as the
Company may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has
failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent; third, if so determined by the Agent and the
Company, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding
obligations with respect to Advances under this Agreement; fourth, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to
the Company as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against such Defaulting Lender as
a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and fifth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise
directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Advances in
respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Advances were made at a time when the
conditions set forth in Section 3.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Advances of all Non-
Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Advances owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such
time as all Revolving Credit Advances are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Revolving Credit Commitments. Any
payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a
Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender
irrevocably consents hereto.
 
  37  
 
 
(iii)            Commitment Fees. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during
which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Company shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been
required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
 
(iv)            All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in Swing Line Advances shall be reallocated among the
Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective ratable portion thereof (calculated on the Revolving Credit Commitments but
without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause
such Non-Defaulting Lender’s aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Advances plus such Non-Defaulting Lender’s
participation in Swing Line Advances to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment. Subject to Section 8.15,
no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising
from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-
Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.
 
(b)            If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall, without
prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable law, prepay all outstanding Swing Line Advances.
 
(c)            Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Company, the Agent and each Swing Line Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a
Defaulting Lender, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any
conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Revolving Credit Advances of the
other Lenders or take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Credit Advances to be held pro rata by
the Lenders in accordance with the Revolving Credit Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that
no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Company while that Lender was a
Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from
Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a
Defaulting Lender.
 
Section 2.20.      The Swing Line Advances
 
(a)            Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Swing Line Lender severally agrees to make a portion of the credit
otherwise available from time to time to the Borrowers by making swing line advances (“Swing Line Advances”) on any Business Day during the
period from the Effective Date until the Termination Date applicable to such Swing Line Lender to the Borrower requesting such extension of
credit under subsection (b) of this Section 2.20. Such Swing Line Advances shall be denominated in Euros and, in the aggregate, shall not exceed
(x) at any time outstanding (i) for each Swing Line Lender (1) such Swing Line Lender’s Swing Line Commitment then in effect and (2) when
aggregated to such Swing Line Lender’s outstanding Revolving Credit Advances and such Swing Line Lender’s unfunded participations in Swing
Line Advances made by any other Swing Line Lender, such Swing Line Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect and (ii) for all
Swing Line Advances, the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit or (y) at the time of such Swing Line Advance, the aggregate Unused Revolving
Credit Commitments of the Lenders. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow
under this Section 2.20, prepay Swing Line Advances under Section 2.10 or repay Swing Line Advances under Section 2.06(a), and reborrow
under this Section 2.20. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Advance, each Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to purchase, from the applicable Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Advance in an
amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share of such Swing Line Advance.
 
  38  
 
 
(b)            Each Swing Line Advance shall be made on notice to the Sub-Agent, given not later than 9:30 A.M. (London time) on the
Business Day on which the proposed Swing Line Advance is to be made. Such notice requirement shall be satisfied by the delivery of a Notice of
Borrowing for such Swing Line Advance by e-mail and such notice shall specify therein (A) the requested date of such Swing Line Advance
(which shall be a Business Day), (B) the requested aggregate amount of Swing Line Advances being requested by such Borrower and (C) the
requested account to which the proceeds of the requested Swing Line Advance are to be transferred. The Sub-Agent will promptly advise the
Swing Line Lenders of any such notice received from a Borrower. Each Swing Line Lender shall make its ratable portion of the requested Swing
Line Advance (such ratable portion to be calculated based upon such Swing Line Lender’s Swing Line Commitment to the total Swing Line
Commitments of all of the Swing Line Lenders) available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Sub-Agent at the account
designated by the Sub-Agent, in same day funds, before 1:00 P.M. (London time) on the date a Borrower has requested such Swing Line Advance.
After the Sub-Agent’s receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Sub-Agent will make such
funds available to such Borrower by transferring the amount thereof to the account designated by such Borrower for such purpose on the date
specified in such Notice of Borrowing.
 
(c)            The failure of any Swing Line Lender to make the Swing Line Advance to be made by it as part of any Swing Line Borrowing
shall not relieve any other Swing Line Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Swing Line Advance on the date of such Swing Line
Borrowing, but no Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Swing Line Lender to make the Swing Line Advance to be
made by such other Lender on the date of any Swing Line Borrowing.
 
(d)            Upon written demand by a Swing Line Lender, with a copy of such demand to the Agent, each other Lender will purchase from
such Swing Line Lender, and such Swing Line Lender shall sell and assign to each such other Lender, such other Lender’s ratable portion of such
outstanding Swing Line Advance, by making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent for the account of such Swing
Line Lender, by deposit to the Agent’s Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such
Swing Line Advance to be purchased by such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees, promptly upon receipt of such notice from the Agent, to purchase its ratable portion of an outstanding
Swing Line Advance on the third Business Day after the date demand therefor. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
by assignment Swing Line Advances pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment
shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Upon any such assignment by any Swing Line Lender to any
other Lender of a portion of a Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line Lender represents and warrants to such other Lender that such Swing Line
Lender is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to such Swing Line Advance, this Agreement, the Notes or the Borrowers. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not
have so made the amount of such Swing Line Advance available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such Lender is required to have made such amount available to the Agent until
the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the higher of the Overnight Rate and the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such
amount, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Agent in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender
shall pay to the Agent such amount for the account of such Swing Line Lender on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal
shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal
amount of the Swing Line Advance made by such Swing Line Lender shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.
 
  39  
 
 
(e)            At any time after any Lender has funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Advance, if any Swing Line Lender receives any
payment on account of such Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line Lender will promptly distribute to such Lender its ratable share thereof in the
same funds as those received by such Swing Line Lender.
 
(f)            Unless the Sub-Agent shall have received notice from a Swing Line Lender prior to the time of any Swing Line Borrowing that
such Swing Line Lender will not make available to the Sub-Agent such Swing Line Lender’s ratable share of such Swing Line Borrowing, the
Sub-Agent may assume that such Swing Line Lender has made such portion available to the Sub-Agent on the date of such Swing Line Borrowing
in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.20 and the Sub-Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower
requesting such Swing Line Borrowing on such date, a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Swing Line Lender shall not have so
made such ratable portion available to the Sub-Agent, such Swing Line Lender and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Sub-Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such
Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Sub-Agent at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Swing
Line Advances and (ii) in the case of such Swing Line Lender, the Overnight Rate. If such Swing Line Lender shall repay to the Sub-Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Swing Line Lender’s Swing Line Advance as part of such Swing Line
Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

laws, rules, regulations and orders, such compliance to include, without limitation, compliance with ERISA, Environmental Laws and Anti-

agreement or instrument relating to such Debt; or any other event shall occur or condition shall exist under any agreement or instrument relating to

(g)            Any event, action or condition with respect to an employee benefit plan of the Company subject to Title IV of ERISA results in
any penalty or action pursuant to ERISA that has a Material Adverse Effect;
 
then, and in any such event, the Agent (i) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Company, declare the
obligation of each Lender to make Advances to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate and (ii) shall at the request, or may with the

presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Company; provided, however, that in the event
of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Company under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (A) the obligation of each Lender to
make Advances shall automatically be terminated and (B) the Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and be due and

ARTICLE VII
 
THE AGENT
 
Section 7.01      Appointment and Authority.
 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank, N.A. to act on its behalf as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
and authorizes the Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together
with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Except as expressly provided herein, the provisions of this Article are solely for the
benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrowers shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and
agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Agent is not intended to
connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of
market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender
prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
 
  48  
 
 
Section 7.02      Rights as a Lender.
 
The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money
to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company or
any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
Section 7.03      Exculpatory Provisions.
 
(a) The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties
hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent:
 
(i)            shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
 
(ii)            shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and
powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents);
provided that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability
or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the
automatic stay under any debtor relief law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in
violation of any debtor relief law; and
 
(iii)            shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be
liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person
serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 
(b)            The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or
such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances
as provided in Sections 8.01 and 6.01), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice
describing such Default is given to the Agent in writing by the Company or a Lender.
 
(c)            The Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent.
 
  49  
 
 
Section 7.04      Reliance by Agent.
 
The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement,
instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with
any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Agent may presume that such
condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Advance.
The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not
be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
Section 7.05      Indemnification.
 
The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company), ratably according to the respective outstanding
principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Advances then made by each of them (or if no Revolving Credit Advances are at the time outstanding, ratably
according to the respective amounts of their Revolving Credit Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement; provided that
no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Agent’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement in bad faith. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees)
incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is
not reimbursed for such expenses by the Company.
 
Section 7.06      Delegation of Duties.
 
The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through
any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent and approved by the Company. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-
agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-
agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non appealable judgment that the Agent acted with gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. The Sub-Agent has been designated under this Agreement to carry out only those
duties as are specified herein. The Sub-Agent shall be subject to each of the obligations in this Agreement to be performed by the Sub-Agent, and each of
the Borrowers and the Lenders agrees that the Sub-Agent shall be entitled to exercise each of the rights and shall be entitled to each of the benefits of the
Agent under this Agreement as such rights and benefits relate to the performance of its obligations hereunder.

Section 7.07      Resignation of Agent.
 
(a)            The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor approved by the Company, which shall be a bank with an office in the United
States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the
Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a
successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in
accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.
 
(b)            If the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (e) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders
may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as Agent and appoint a successor
approved by the Company. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30
days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become
effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.
 
(c)            With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and
determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall
succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent, and the retiring or removed Agent shall
be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring or removed
Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article (and, as to the Agent, Section 8.04) shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent.
 
(d)            Any resignation pursuant to this Section by a Person acting as Agent shall, unless such Person shall notify the Borrowers and
the Lenders otherwise, also act to relieve such Person and its Affiliates of any obligation to advance Swing Line Advances where such advance is to occur
on or after the effective date of such resignation. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swing Line Lender, (ii) the retiring Swing Line Lender shall be
discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, (iii) the successor Swing Line Lender shall enter into an
Assignment and Assumption and acquire from the retiring Swing Line Lender each outstanding Swing Line Advance of such retiring Swing Line Lender
for a purchase price equal to par plus accrued interest.

Section 7.08      Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on
such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or
based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
Section 7.09      Syndication Agent and Lead Arrangers.
 
Without prejudice to the obligations of the Agent and the Sub-Agent hereunder, the Syndication Agent and Lead Arrangers, in their capacities as
such, have no duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement.

doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower, that none of the Agent or any Lead Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates is a fiduciary with respect to
the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Advances, the Commitments
and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any

Section 7.11      Erroneous Payments.
 
(a)            If the Agent notifies a Lender, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender (any such Lender or other recipient, a
“Payment Recipient”) that the Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding clause
(b)) that any funds received by such Payment Recipient from the Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or
mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender or other Payment Recipient on its behalf) (any such funds, whether
received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually and collectively, an “Erroneous
Payment”) and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the
Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the Agent, and such Lender shall (or, with respect to any
Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days
thereafter, return to the Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in
the currency so received), together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof)
was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent in same day funds at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a
rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. A notice of the Agent to any
Payment Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
  53  
 
 
(b)            Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender,
hereby further agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal,
interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that
specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or
repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or
(z) that such Lender, or such other recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) in each
case:
 
(i)            (A) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written
confirmation from the Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case, with
respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and
 
(ii)            such Lender shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all
events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the
details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Agent pursuant to this Section 7.11(b).
 
(c)            Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan
Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Agent to such Lender from any source, against any amount due to the Agent under immediately
preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement.
 
(d)            In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the
Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from
any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an “Erroneous
Payment Return Deficiency”), upon the Agent’s notice to such Lender at any time, (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Advances (but not
its Commitments) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Agent may specify) (such assignment of
such Advances (but not Commitments), the “Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment”) at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment
fee to be waived by the Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Company) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption
(or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an approved electronic platform as to
which the Agent and such parties are participants) to the Agent, as the assignee Lender, with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment,
and such Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Advances to the Borrowers or the Agent, (ii) the Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to
acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender
hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to
such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender and (iv) the Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership
interest in the Advances subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. The Agent may sell any Advances acquired pursuant to an Erroneous
Payment Deficiency Assignment in accordance with Section 8.07 hereof (pursuant to which the prior written consent of the Company is required for any
such sale (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)), and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return
Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Advance (or portion thereof), and the Agent shall retain
all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of
doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Agent has sold an Advance (or portion
thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Agent
shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment
Return Deficiency (the “Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights”).
 
  54  
 
 
(e)            The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any obligations owed by
any Borrower, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, or any portion of such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the
amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Agent from any Borrower for the purpose of making a payment,
prepayment, repayment, discharge or satisfaction in respect of the obligations under any Loan Document. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (d) above and
this clause (e) shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the
obligations of any Borrower relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the obligations of any Borrower that would have been payable had the
Erroneous Payment not been made by the Agent.
 
(f)            To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby
waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by
the Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any
similar doctrine
 
(g)            Each party’s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 7.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent, any
transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of
all obligations of any Borrower (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

No failure on the part of any Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any other Loan Document

Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of, or in connection with the preparation for a defense of, any

brought by any Borrower, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is
otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, except to the extent such claim, damage,
loss, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified
Party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement in bad faith.
 
None of the Agent, any Lender or any of their Affiliates or their officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, a “Lender-
Related Party”) shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or

demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses,
costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or Conversion, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.
 
(d)            Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Company contained in Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 8.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder

the Note held by such Lender, whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note and although such obligations

Section 8.07      Assignments and Participations.
 
(a)            Each Lender may, upon ten days’ notice to the Agent (and in the case of an assignment of any Swing Line Commitment, the

varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement, (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior
to such assignment, was a Lender or an affiliate of a Lender, or an assignment of all of a Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, the
amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment or Swing Line Commitment (as applicable) of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each

$10,000,000, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Company

concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender
under this Agreement, (v) no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by the Company pursuant to this
Section 8.07(a) unless and until such Lender shall have received one or more payments from either the Company or one or more Eligible
Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together
with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement,
(vi) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register (as defined in

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose vehicle (an
“SPV”) of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Agent and the Company, the option
to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers
pursuant to Section 2.01, provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Advance, (ii) if an SPV elects
not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such
Advance pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Borrowers may bring any proceeding against either the Granting Lender or the SPV in order to
enforce any rights of the Borrowers hereunder. The making of an Advance by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting
Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Advance were made by the Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable
for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Lender
makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior
indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof arising out of
any claim against such SPV under this Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, any SPV may
with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Company or the Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a
portion of its interests in any Advances to its Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Company and the Agent)
providing liquidity and/or credit support (if any) with respect to commercial paper issued by such SPV to fund such Advances and such SPV may
disclose, on a confidential basis, confidential information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to any rating agency, commercial paper
dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit liquidity enhancement to such SPV. This paragraph may not be amended without the consent of
any SPV at the time holding Advances under this Agreement.

confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Assumption, such

perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility
with respect to the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its obligations under this
Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this
Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; (iv) such assignee will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms
that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such
powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are
reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the
terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

Eligible Assignee, together with any Revolving Credit Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and
Assumption has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption, (ii) record the
information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Company. The relevant Borrower, at its own expense, shall
if so requested pursuant to Section 2.13(e) execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered Revolving Credit Note a new
Revolving Credit Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment
and Assumption and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Revolving Credit Note to the order of the assigning
Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Revolving Credit Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Revolving Credit Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of
such Assignment and Assumption and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.
 
(d)            The Agent acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the relevant Borrower shall maintain at its address referred

Assignment and Assumption delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and, with
respect to Lenders, the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the “Register”). The

or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances
owing to it (including such Lender’s participations in Swing Line Advances) and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such
Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any
such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any such participation
shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure by any
Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any
fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, postpone any date fixed for any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation or

participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the relevant Borrower, maintain a register at one of its offices located
within the United States on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Advances owing to, each participant from time to time (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose
all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s
interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is
necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United
States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement.

Exhibit A to
Credit Agreement
 
FORM OF REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE
 
U.S.$__________
 
Dated: __________, 20__
 
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, PEPSICO, INC., a North Carolina corporation (the “Borrower”), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY to
the order of _____________________ (the “Lender”) for the account of its Applicable Lending Office on the Termination Date (each as defined in the
Credit Agreement referred to below) the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to the Five-Year
Credit Agreement dated as of May 26, 2023 among the Borrower, the Lender and certain other lenders parties thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for the
Lender and such other lenders (as amended or modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”; the terms defined therein being used herein as therein
defined) outstanding on the Termination Date.
 
The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Advance from the date of such Revolving Credit
Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at such interest rates, and payable at such times, as are specified in the Credit Agreement.
 
Both principal and interest in respect of each Advance (i) denominated in Dollars are payable in lawful money of the United States of America and
(ii) denominated in Euros are payable in such currency, in each case to Citibank, N.A., as Agent, at the Agent’s Account, in same day funds for the account
of the Lender. Each Revolving Credit Advance owing to the Lender by the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and all payments made on account
of principal thereof, shall be recorded by the Lender and, prior to any transfer hereof, endorsed on the grid attached hereto which is part of this Promissory
Note. Each such endorsement shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information so endorsed.
 
This Promissory Note is one of the Revolving Credit Notes referred to in, and is entitled to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement. The Credit
Agreement, among other things, (i) provides for the making of Revolving Credit Advances by the Lender to the Borrower from time to time in an aggregate
amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the U.S. dollar amount first above mentioned, the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from each such
Revolving Credit Advance being evidenced by this Promissory Note, (ii) contains provisions for determining the Equivalent in Dollars for Advances
denominated in Euros and (iii) contains provisions for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the happening of certain stated events and also for
prepayments on account of principal hereof prior to the maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions therein specified.
 
The Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights
hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of such rights.
 
 
 
 
This Promissory Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

therein being used herein as therein defined) dated as of May 26, 2023 among PepsiCo, Inc., (the “Company”), Citibank, N.A., as Agent (the “Agent”), and
the banks party thereto (the “Lenders”).
 
The Company hereby designates [_______________] (the “Borrowing Subsidiary”), a Subsidiary of the Company and a corporation duly
incorporated under the laws of [_______________], as a Borrower in accordance with Section 2.17 of the Credit Agreement until such designation is
terminated in accordance with said Section 2.17.
 
The Borrowing Subsidiary hereby accepts the above designation and hereby expressly and unconditionally accepts the obligations of a Borrower
under the Credit Agreement, adheres to the Credit Agreement and agrees and confirms that, upon your execution and return to the Company of the enclosed
copy of this letter, such Borrowing Subsidiary shall be a Borrower for purposes of the Credit Agreement and agrees to be bound by and perform and
comply with the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement applicable to it as if it had originally executed the Credit Agreement as a Borrower. The
Borrowing Subsidiary hereby authorizes and empowers the Company to act as its representative and attorney-in-fact for the purposes of signing documents

Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and for the purposes of modifying or amending any provision of the Credit Agreement and further
agrees that the Agent and each Lender may conclusively rely on the foregoing authorization. The Borrowing Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants to
the Agent and each Lender that, as of the date hereof, the information included in the Beneficial Ownership Certification in relation to the Borrowing

The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Agent and each Lender that, before and after giving effect to this Designation Letter, (i) the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.01 of the Credit Agreement (except the representations set forth in the last sentence of subsection

(ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing. The Borrowing Subsidiary represents and warrants that each of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.01(a) (as if the reference therein to North Carolina were a reference to its jurisdiction of organization), (b), (c) and (d) of the Credit Agreement
are true as if each reference therein to the Company were a reference to the Borrowing Subsidiary and as if each reference therein to the Loan Documents
were a reference to this Designation Letter and the Note, if any, executed by the Borrowing Subsidiary in connection herewith.
 
 
 
 
The Borrowing Subsidiary is hereby aware that this Designation Letter, the Credit Agreement and the Notes, if any, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Borrowing Subsidiary hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United

irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The
Borrowing Subsidiary further agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding brought in New York may be made upon it by service upon
the Borrower at the “Address for Notices” specified below its name on the signature page to this Designation Letter.
