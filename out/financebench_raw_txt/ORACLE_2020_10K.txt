Item 1.
Business Oracle
 provides  products  and  services  that  address  enterprise  information technology  (IT)  environments.  Our  products  and  services  include  applications  andinfrastructure
 offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premisedeployments, cloud-based deployments, and hybrid
 deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployment) such as our OracleCloud
 at  Customer  offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer’s  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility to  our  customers  andfacilitate
 the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, governmentagencies,
 educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle PartnerNetwork.
Oracle
 Cloud  Software-as-a-Service  and  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (SaaS  and  IaaS,  respectively,  and  collectively,  Oracle  Cloud  Services)  offerings  provide  acomprehensive
 and integrated stack of applications and infrastructure services delivered via a cloud-based deployment model. Oracle Cloud Services integratethe
 software,  hardware  and  services  on  a  customer’s  behalf  in  a  cloud-based  IT  environment  that  Oracle  deploys,  upgrades,  supports  and  manages  for  thecustomer.
 Oracle  Cloud  Services  are  designed  to  be  rapidly  deployable  to  enable  customers  shorter  time  to  innovation;  intuitive  for  casual  and  experiencedusers;
 easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability andextendibility
 between IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiringlower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable.
Oracle
 cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  deployment  offerings  include  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database  and  Oracle  Middleware  software  offerings,among
 others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially allcustomers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.
Oracle hardware product offerings
 include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others. Customers generally opt topurchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware.
Oracle also offers services to
 assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.Providing choice
 and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important elementof
 our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications andinfrastructure
 technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewerofferings, more restrictive deployment models and less flex
ibility for a customer’s transition to cloud-based IT environments.Our
 investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our cloud and license, hardware and services businesses(described
 further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we invested $6.1 billion, $6.0 billion and $6.1billion,
 respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and products and to develop new technologies and services. Wehave a
 deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another. We focus our development efforts onimproving the
 performance, security, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings relative to our competitors; making it easier for organizationsto
 deploy,  use,  manage  and  maintain  our  offerings;  and  incorporating  emerging  technologies  within  our  offerings  to  enable  leaner  business  processes,automation
 and innovation. For example, the Oracle Autonomous Database is designed to deliver transformational infrastructure through an Oracle Cloud IaaSoffering
 that utilizes Oracle’s Generation 2 Cloud Infrastructure’s  machine  learning capabilities. After  an initial purchase  of Oracle products  and  services, ourcustomers can
 continue to benefit from our research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offeringsfor their
3

license
 and hardware deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle CloudServices contracts 
with us. Our
 selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products andservices that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale
 to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increasestockholder
 value.  We  have  invested  billions  of  dollars  over  time  to  acquire  a  number  of  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies  that  add  to,  arecomplementary
 to,  or  have  otherwise  enhanced  our  existing  offerings.  We  expect  to  continue  to  acquire  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies  tofurther our corporate strategy.
We have three businesses:
 
•our  cloud and license business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our Oracle Cloud Services offerings, cloud license andon-premise
 license offerings, and license support offerings, represented 83% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, and 81% of ourtotal revenues in fiscal 2018;
 
•our hardware business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our hardware products and related hardware  support servicesofferings, represented 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, and 10% of our total revenues in f
iscal 2018; and 
•our  services business, which is comprised of a single operating segment, represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, and9% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018.
Management’s
 Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  results  of  Operations  and  Note  15  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  bothincluded elsewhere in this Annual report, provide additional information related t
o our businesses and operating segments.Oracle Corporation was incorporated 
in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on 
Oracle’s BusinessOracle
 is committed to the health, safety and welfare of our employees, customers, suppliers,  communities, stockholders and  other stakeholders. While theworld
 continues to navigate the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we are committed to providing critical technologies, programsand
 support to individuals and organizations to navigate, adjust and continue their operations in light of the unique demands and constraints imposed by thepandemic.
 For  decades,  we  have  developed,  delivered  and  supported  products  and  services  that  enable  telecommunication  companies  to  keep  peopleconnected;
 retailers to provide food and other necessities; researchers to identify solutions; hospitals to provide care; airlines to ensure travel; banks to helppeople
 access funds; insurers to provide benefits; governments to keep people safe and informed; utilities to supply power and water; and many other criticalfunctions.
We
 have  proactively  sought,  supported,  donated  to,  partnered  and  engaged  with  organizations  globally  that  provide  critical  medicines,  research,  goods  andservices to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including:
 
•medical research organizations, which power COVID-19 simulati on and modeling projects using Oracle Cloud IaaS;   
•the  U.S.  federal  government,  which  received  an  Oracle  system  to  collect  and  distribute  information  as  to  how  COVID-19  patients  respond  topotential therapies;
 
•hospitals,  which  have  utilized  Oracle  infrastructure  technologies  to  rapidly  develop  and  deploy  applications  that  collect,  analyze  and  managecharacteristics of COVID-19 patients;
 
•enterprises,  which  have  the  ability  to  complimentarily  access  Oracle  Human  Capital  Management  (HCM)  Cloud  options  for  employee  health  andsafety programs in order to proactively
 manage and respond to COVID-19 implications on their workforces;4

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
 
•state  and local government agencies,  which have  utilized Oracle Cloud SaaS solutions to develop and target constituent outreach related to  COVID- 19, and to assess, research and respond to COVID-19 incident management on a unified platform
; and  
•pharmaceutical companies, which power their research and clinical trials using Or acle Health Sciences solutions;among
 dozens of other specific use cases, programs and partnerships that Oracle has donated to, partnered with, developed and supported in response to theCOVID-19 pandemic.
Oracle applicati
ons and infrastructure technologies are critical to the business operations of our customers, which number in the hundreds of thousands across abroad geographic
 and industry base. We are profitable and generate a large amount of positive cash flow from our operations and we do not believe the COVID-19 pandemic will jeopardize either of these characteristics of 
our business. Other impacts due to COVID-19 on our business are currently unknown.For
 additional details regarding the impacts and risks to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A risk Factors and Item 7 Management’sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and results of Operations included elsewhere in this Annual report on Form 10-K.Applications and Infrastructure Technologies
Oracle’s
 comprehensive  portfolio  of  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  is  designed  to  address  an  organization’s  IT  environment  needs  includingbusiness
 process,  infrastructure  and  applications  development  requirements,  among  others.  Oracle  technologies  are  based  upon  industry  standards  and  aredesigned
 to be enterprise-grade, reliable, scalable and secure. Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies including database and middleware softwareas
 well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure products and services are the buildingblocks
 of  Oracle  Cloud  Services,  our  partners’  cloud  services,  and  our  customers’  cloud  IT  environments.  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  aremarketed
 and  sold  through  our  cloud  and  license,  hardware,  and  services  businesses  and  are  delivered  through  the  Oracle  Cloud,  or  through  other  ITdeployment
 models including cloud-based, hybrid and on-premise deployments. We believe Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings enable flexibility,interoperability and choice to best meet customer IT needs.
We believe that our Oracle Cloud Services offer
ings are opportunities for us to expand our cloud and license business. We believe that our customers increasinglyrecognize
 the value of access to cloud-based applications and infrastructure capabilities via a lower cost, rapidly deployable, flexible and interoperable servicesmodel
 that Oracle manages, upgrades and maintains on the customer’s behalf. We believe that we can market and sell our SaaS and IaaS offerings together tohelp
 customers migrate their extensive installed base of on-premise applications and infrastructure technologies to the Oracle Cloud while at the same timereaching
 a broader ecosystem of developers and partners. We also believe we can market our SaaS and IaaS services to small and medium-sized businesses andnon-IT lines of business purchasers due to the highly available, intuitive design, low
 touch and low cost characteristics of the Oracle Cloud.In
 recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services deployment models hasincreased.
 To  address  customer  demand  and  enable  customer  choice,  we  have  introduced  certain  programs  for  customers  to  pivot  their  applications  andinfrastructure
 licenses and license support contracts to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for theirexisting workloads. We expect these trends to continue.
Applications Technologies

offerings
 are designed to support connected business processes in the cloud and are centered on an intuitive interface, a responsive and flexible business core,and
 a common data model. We believe Oracle ErP Cloud is a strategic suite of applications that is foundational to facilitate and extract more business value outof

As described below, we provide customers the option to purchase license support contracts in connection with the purchase of Oracle Applications 
licenses.Oracle License Support
Oracle
 license support offerings are marketed and sold as a part of our cloud and license business. Substantially all of our customers opt to purchase licensesupport

devices.
 Oracle Cloud Operations leverage automated software tools to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technology capabilities to the Oracle Cloudas they become available, providing Oracle customers 
access to the latest Oracle technologies generally on a quarterly cadence. Manufacturing
To
 produce our hardware products that we market and sell to third-party customers and that Oracle Cloud Operations utilize internally to deliver Oracle CloudServices,
 we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third-party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consistprimaril
y of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center serversand
 storage products. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware-related components andhardware
 products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these componentsand products. We distribute most of our hardware products from either our facilit
ies or partner facilities. Our manufacturing processes are substantially based onstandardization
 of components across product types, centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a “build-to-order” methodology in which productsgenerally
 are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, productsubassemblies
 and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sourcesare readily availab
le. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. As a result, we monitor and evaluate potential risks of disruptionto
 our supply chain operations. refer to “risk Factors” included in Item 1A within this Annual report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounterwith respect to the sources and availability
 of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business.Sales and Marketing
We directly market and sell our cloud, license, hardware, support and services offerings to
 businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agenciesand
 educational  institutions.  We  also  market  and  sell  our  offerings  through  indirect  channels.  No  single  customer  accounted  for  10%  or  more  of  our  totalrevenues in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.
In
 the United States (U.S.), our sales and services employees are based in our headquarters and in field offices throughout the country. Outside the U.S., ourinternational subsidiaries sell, support and service our offerings in their
 local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate througha
 direct  sales  subsidiary.  Our  geographic  coverage  allows  us  to  draw  on  business  and  technical  expertise  from  a  global  workforce,  provides  stability  to  ouroperations
 and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends, and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings.Our
 international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in “risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Annual report. A summary ofour
 domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in thisAnnual report.
We
 also market  our  product  offerings  worldwide  through  indirect  channels.  The  companies  that  comprise  our  indirect  channel  network  are  members  of theOracle
 Partner  Network.  The  Oracle  Partner  Network  is  a  global  program  that  manages  our  business  relationships  with  a  large,  broad-based  network  ofcompanies,
 including independent software and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based uponour
 product  offerings.  By offering  our partners  access  to our product  offerings,  educational  information,  technical  services,  marketing  and sales support,  theOracle
 Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions tocustomers globally. 
The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and value-added resellers. 13

Research and Development
We
 develop the substantial majority of our product offerings internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property throughacquisitions
 of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us tomaintain technical control over
 the design and development of our products. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relateto
 various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principalbusinesses.
 rapid technological advances in cloud, software and hardware development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology,changing
 customer  needs  and  frequent  new  product  introductions,  offerings  and  enhancements  characterize  the  markets  in  which  we  compete.  We  plan  tocontinue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts t
o maintain and improve our current products and services offerings.Employees
As
 of May 31, 2020, we employed approximately 135,000 full-time employees, including approximately 36,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 19,000 inour
 cloud services and license support operations, approximately 3,000 in hardware, approximately 25,000 in services, approximately 39,000 in research anddevelopment
 and  approximately  13,000  in  general  and  administrative  positions.  Of  these  employees,  approximately  47,000  were  employed  in  the  U.S.  andapproximately 88,000 were employed internationally. None 
of our employees in the U.S. is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries,labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of our empl
oyees.Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our
 quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans,which
 are common in the technology industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter andlowest
 in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses (in particular, our cloud and license business and hardware business) are generallyaffected
 by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues because certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See“Cloud
 and  License  Business”  and  “Selected  Quarterly  Financial  Data”  in  Item  7  of  this  Annual  report  for  more  information  regarding  the  seasonality  andcyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins.
Competition
We
 face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firmsemerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise
 change.Our
 customers  are  demanding  less  complexity  and  lower  total  cost  in  the  implementation,  sourcing,  integration  and  ongoing  maintenance  of  their  ITenvironments.
 Our  enterprise  cloud,  license  and  hardware  offerings  compete  directly  with  certain  offerings  from  some  of  the  largest  and  most  competitivecompanies
 in  the  world,  including  Amazon.com,  Inc.,  Microsoft  Corporation,  International  Business  Machines  Corporation  (IBM),  Intel  Corporation,  CiscoSystems,
 Inc.,  Adobe  Systems  Incorporated,  Alphabet  Inc.  and  SAP  SE,  as  well  as  other  companies  like  Hewlett-Packard  Enterprise,  salesforce.com,  inc.  andWorkday,
 Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequentlyemerge
 to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providingpoint solutions, or
 offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increasedcompetition
 as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we havenot
 previously  competed.  Moreover,  we  or  our  competitors  may  take  certain  strategic  actions—including  acquisitions,  partnerships  and  joint  ventures,  orrepositioning of product lines—which invite even greater competition in one or m
ore product offering categories.14

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
Key
 competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance,scalability,
 reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease  of use, speed  to production and quality of technical support. Our product and service sales (and therelative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors) 
are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other factors :  
•market adoption of cloud-based IT offerings including SaaS and IaaS offerings; 
•the ease of deployment, use, transacting for and maintenance of our products and services offerings; 
•compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our OracleCloud environments;
 
•the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors; 
•the broader “platform” competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft; 
•operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft’s Windows Server, andother UNIX and Linux operating systems;
 
•the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers; 
•products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff; 
•products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and 
•the attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.For more information about the competitive r
isks we face, refer to Item 1A “risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual report.Available Information

Item 1A.
Risk Factors We
 operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannotcontrol
 or predict. The following discussion, as well as our “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial
 Condition and results of Operations (Item 7), highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefullyconsider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.
The
 COVID-19  pandemic  has  affected  how  we  and  our  customers  are  operating  our  respective  businesses,  and  the  duration  and  extent  to  which  this  willimpact our future results o
f operations and our overall financial performance remains uncertain.  A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) w as first identified inlate
 calendar year 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The long-term impacts, if any, of the globalCOVID-19
 pandemic  on  our  business  are  currently  unknown.  We  are  conducting  business  as  usual  with  modifications  to  employee  travel,  employee  worklocations,
 and  cancellation  of  certain  marketing  events,  among  other  modifications.  We  will  continue  to  actively  monitor  the  situation  and  may  take  furtheractions
 that  alter  our  business  operations  as  may  be  required  by  federal,  state  or  local  authorities  or  that  we  determine  are  in  the  best  interests  of  ouremployees, customers, partners, s
uppliers and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential long-term effects of any such alterations or modifications may haveon our business, including the effects on our customers and prospects.
We
 have observed other companies, including customers and partners, taking precautionary and preemptive actions to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Suchcompanies
 may  take  further  actions  that  alter  their  normal  business  operations  if  there  are  future  spikes  of  COVID-19  infections  resulting  in  additionalgovernment
 mandated  shutdowns.  The  conditions  caused  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  have  adversely  affected  our  customers’  willingness  to  purchase  ourproducts
 and delayed prospective customers’ purchasing decisions.  The impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the broader global economy have beenswift,
 dramatic  and  unpredictable.  The  latency  and  duration  of  these  impacts  are  diverse  across  geographies  and  jurisdictions  in  which  we  market,  sell  anddevelop
 our offerings. The depth and duration of the current economic declines attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, and any potential economic recoveries,are
 not  currently  known.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2020  we  experienced  revenue  declines  compared  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2019  and  delayedpayments
 from customers. The effect of the pandemic for fiscal 2021 and future periods is unknown. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact ofthe COVID-19 pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed.
Our
 success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products andservices.
     rapid  technological  advances,  intense  competition,  changing  delivery  models  and  evolving  standards  in  computer  hardware  and  softwaredevelopment
 and  communications  infrastructure,  changing  and  increasingly  sophisticated  customer  needs  and  frequent  new  product  introductions  andenhancements
 characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhanceand
 improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may notpurchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support, hardware support or cl
oud subscriptions contracts. renewals of thesecontracts
 are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop newproducts will allow us to compete effective
ly for business opportunities in emerging areas.We 
have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly drivinginnovations
 in  technology  but  if  they  fail  to  operate  as  anticipated  or  our  other  products  do  not  perform  as  promised,  our  business  and  reputation  may  beharmed
. 17

In addition, our busines
s may be adversely affected if:  
•we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames; 
•infrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in greater costs than anticipated; 
•there is a delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customers to new, enhanced or acquired product lines orservices;
 
•there are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts; 
•we do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner; or 
•we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.Our
 Oracle  Cloud  strategy,  including  our  Oracle  Cloud  Software-as-a-Service  and  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (SaaS  and  IaaS, respectively,  and  collectively,Oracle
 Cloud Services)  offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.     We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide viadeployment models that best suit their needs, including via our cloud-based SaaS and IaaS 
offerings. As these business models continue to evolve, we may not beable to compete effectively, ge
nerate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud andSaaS
 delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings. If we do not successfully executeour
 cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and ourrevenues and profitability could decline.
As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volat
ility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing ofrevenue
 recognition  between  our  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license,  and  hardware  product  arrangements  relative  to  our  cloud  offering  arrangements.Customers
 generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms ofthe
 subscriptions. Consequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidatedstatement of operations. This is in
 contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements, which are generally recognized in full atthe
 time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products. In  addition, we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transition from or be ableto
 sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license, hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of anddemand for our Oracle Cloud Services, which could adversely affect our revenues and profit
ability.We
 might experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings.     Despite  testing prior to therelease and throughout
 the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding, manufacturing or configurationerrors
 that  can  impact  their  function,  performance  and  security,  and  result  in  other  negative  consequences.  The  detection  and  correction  of  any  errors  inreleased
 cloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings could affect their ability toproperly
 function, integrate or operate with other cloud, license or hardware offerings, could delay the development or release of new products or services ornew
 versions  of  products  or  services,  could  create  security  vulnerabilities  in  our  products  or  services,  and  could  adversely  affect  market  acceptance  of  ourproducts
 or services. This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own. If we experience errors or delays in releasing our cloud,license
 or hardware offerings or new versions of these offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle’s businessoperations
 as  well as  cloud  and  other  services  that  we  offer  to  our  customers  on  our  products  and  networks.  Therefore,  any  flaws  could  affect  our  and  ourcustomers’ abilities to conduct business
 operations and to ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting, and may result in unanticipated costs. Enterprisecustomers
 rely on our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud, license and hardware offeringsand related services could expose us to product liability,

performance and warranty claims as wel
l as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.If
 our  security  measures  for  our  products  and  services  are  compromised  and  as  a  result,  our  data,  our  customers’  data  or  our  IT  systems  are  accessedimproperly,
 made  unavailable,  or  improperly  modified,  our  products  and  services  may  be  perceived  as  vulnerable,  our  brand  and  reputation  could  bedamaged,
 the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, all of which could reduceour
 revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.     We are in the IT business, and our products andservices,
 including our Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, as well as our owndata.
 We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services, and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protectingthe
 integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage. At times, we encounter attempts by third parties (whichmay
 include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation states and individuals sponsored bythem)
 to  identify  and  exploit  product  and  service  vulnerabilities,  penetrate  or  bypass  our  security  measures,  and  gain  unauthorized  access  to  our  or  ourcustomers’,
 partners’  and  suppliers’  software,  hardware  and  cloud  offerings,  networks  and  systems,  any  of  which  could  lead  to  the  compromise  of  personalinformation
 or the  confidential  information  or data of Oracle  or our  customers.  Computer  hackers  and  others  may be able to develop  and  deploy  IT relatedviruses,
 worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilitiesof
 our  networks,  systems,  products  and  services,  create  system  disruptions  and  cause  shutdowns  or  denials  of  service.  This  is  also  true  for  third-party  data,products or services incorporated into our own. Our products and services, including our Oracle Cloud Services, may
 also be accessed or modified improperly as aresult
 of customer, partner, employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees orsuppliers
 into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers’, suppliers’or partners’ data or the IT systems of Oracle, 
our customers, suppliers or partners.Security
 industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyber-attacks targeting IT products and businesses. Although thisis an industry-wide problem that affects softw
are and hardware companies generally, it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus theirefforts
 on the most prominent IT companies, and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secureproducts
 and services. These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data, includingpersonal
 information  and  our  customers’  confidential  information  and  data,  and  host  or  manage  parts  of  our  customers’  businesses  in  cloud-based  ITenvironments,
 especially  in  customer  sectors  involving  particularly  sensitive  data  such  as  health  sciences,  financial  services,  retail,  hospitality  and  thegovernment.
 We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. Whilewe
 make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate thesecompanies within Oracle.
Because
 the  techniques  used  to  obtain unauthorized  access  to,  or sabotage IT  systems change  frequently,  grow more complex over  time, and  often  are notrecognized until launched against a target, we may be
 unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques. Our internal IT systemscontinue
 to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies. However, our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace withthese changes as
 new threats emerge. In addition, we often experience increased activity of this  nature during times of instability, including during the COVID-19pandemic,
 when our operations may be more susceptible to malfeasance due to operational changes instituted to comply with safety, health and regulatoryrequirements, among others. We
 may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach.We
 could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modificationof
 our customers’ or suppliers’ data, other external data, or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or ifour products or
 services are reported to have or are perceived as having security vulnerabilities. Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability ofour products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to not be
19

secure.
 This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenues  and earnings. The costs we would incur to addressand fix these security
 incidents would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to loss or destruction of information, inappropriateuse
 of proprietary and sensitive data, lawsuits, indemnity obligations, regulatory investigations and financial penalties, and claims and increased legal liability,including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notificati
on and fraud monitoring.Our products
 operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem. If there is a security vulnerability in one ofthese components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we
 could face increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenue, or harmto our reputation or competitive position.
Our
 business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation,legal
 requirements or industry standards relating to privacy and data protection.     As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwidelaws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more
 complex, potential risks related to data collection and use withinour
 business will intensify. In addition, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations, or may in the nearfuture interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a
 manner that could significantly impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and dataproviders, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other informat
ion that is integral to certain services we provide.In 
the wake of the European Union General Data Protection regulation (GDPr), the rate of global consideration and adoption of privacy laws has increased,giving
 rise to more global jurisdictions in which regulatory inquiries and audits may be requested of Oracle, and if we are not deemed to be in compliance, couldresult
 in enforcement actions and/or fines. This is true in the U.S., where the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective in January 2020, the U.S.Congress
 is considering several privacy bills at the federal level, and other state legislatures are considering privacy laws. regulators globally are also imposinggreater
 monetary  fines  for  privacy  violations.  The  GDPr,  which  became  effective  in  May  2018,  provides  for  monetary  penalties  of  up  to  4%  of  anorganization’s
 worldwide revenue. These penalties can be significant. For example, one European data protection regulator has fined a major U.S. technologycompany
 EUr  50  million  for  its  data  handling  practices.  The  U.S.  Federal  Trade  Commission  continues  to  fine  companies  on  a  regular  basis  for  unfair  anddeceptive
 data protection practices, and these fines may increase in size. The CCPA provides for statutory damages on a per violation basis that could be verylarge
 in the event of a significant data security breach or other CCPA violation. Taken together, the changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhancedprotection of personal and
 other types of data could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to data protection, and our cost of providing our productsand
 services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate. Although wehave
 implemented contracts, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that ouremployees,
 contractors,  partners,  data  providers  or  agents  will  not  violate  such  laws  and  regulations  or  our  contracts,  policies  and  procedures.  Additionally,public perception and
 standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators toenact regulations and laws that may l
imit our ability to provide certain products and services. We
 make  statements  about  our  use  and  disclosure  of  personal  information  through  our  privacy  policy,  information  provided  on  our  website  and  pressstatements.
 Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with these public statements or with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, includinglaws
 and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations,could
 result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affectour business and harm our reputation.
Economic,
 political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth andprofitability,
 which in turn could adversely affect our stock price.      Our  business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that wehave no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:
20

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
 
•general economic and business conditions; 
•overall demand for enterprise cloud, license and hardware products and services; 
•governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and 
•general legal, regulatory and political developments.Macroeconomic
 developments like the United Kingdom leaving the EU (Brexit), evolving trade policies between the U.S. and international trade partners, or theoccurrence
 of  similar  events  in  other  countries  that  lead  to  uncertainty  or  instability  in  economic,  political  or  market  conditions  could  negatively  affect  ourbusiness,
 operating  results,  financial  condition  and  outlook,  which,  in  turn,  could  adversely  affect  our  stock  price.  Any  general  weakening  of,  and  relateddeclining
 corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers toreduce
 or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or causecustomers not to pay us or to delay
 paying us for previously purchased products and services.In
 addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for otherhostilit
ies in various parts of the world, public health crises such as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, and natural disasters continue to contributeto
 a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth andprofitabi
lity. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise license, hardware and related services and, to a lesserextent, also may affect our renewal
 rates for license support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.If
 we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.     We face  intense competition in all aspectsof
 our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technologyevolves
 and as delivery models change. Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructuretechnologies
 including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence,compute,
 storage  and  networking  products,  among  others,  which  compete  with  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings.  Use  of  our  competitors’technologies
 influences  a  customer’s  purchasing  decision  or  creates  an  environment  that  makes  it  less  efficient  to  utilize  or  migrate  to  Oracle  products  andservices.
 Our competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may notgenerally
 find acceptable, which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services. We could lose customers if our competitors introducenew competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer more
flexible
 business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives inwhich
 competitors  may  provide  software  and  intellectual  property  for  free.  Existing  or  new  competitors  could  gain  sales  opportunities  or  customers  at  ourexpense.
We
 may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.     The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and generaleconomic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop
products
 that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices, introduce pricing models and offerings that are less favorable to us, oroffer
 other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operating results.Additionally,
 the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud andlicense,
 hardware  and  services  offerings,  and  we  may  also  incur  increased  cloud  delivery  expenses  as  we  expand  our  cloud  operations  and  update  ourinfrastructure,
 all  of  which  could  reduce  our  revenues  and/or  profitability.  Our  license  support  fees  and  hardware  support  fees  are  generally  priced  as  apercentage
 of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, whichcould put pressure on us to further discount our offerings.

We 
introduced  Oracle  Bring  Your  Own  License  (BYOL)  and  Universal  Credit  Pricing  to  simplify  the  way  customers  purchase  and  consume  our  cloud  services.Oracle
 BYOL enables customers to maintain their existing software licenses for Oracle Infrastructure while expanding their IaaS  footprint at a discounted price.Oracle
 Universal  Credit  Pricing  provides  a  flexible  model  for  customers  to  access  Oracle  Infrastructure  services  on  demand  via  a  single  contract.  Any  futurechanges
 to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the newpricing
 policies.  Some  of  our  competitors  may  bundle  products  for  promotional  purposes  or  as  a  long-term  pricing  strategy,  commit  to  large  customerdeployments
 at  prices  that  are  unprofitable,  or  provide  guarantees  of  prices  and  product  implementations.  These  practices  could,  over  time,  significantlyconstrain
 the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products orchanges in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us t
o change our pricing models . Our
 international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.     We derive a substantial portion of ourrevenues
 from,  and  have  significant  operations,  outside  of  the  U.S.  Our  international  operations  include  cloud  operations,  cloud,  software  and  hardwaredevelopment, manufacturing, assembly, sales, customer support, consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers.
Compliance
 with  international  and  U.S.  laws  and  regulations  that  apply  to  our  international  operations  increases  our  cost  of  doing  business  in  foreignjurisdictions.
 These  laws  and  regulations  include  U.S.  laws  and  local  laws  which  include  data  privacy  requirements,  labor  relations  laws,  tax  laws,  foreigncurrency-related
 regulations,  anti-competition  regulations,  anti-bribery  laws  and  other  laws  prohibiting  payments  to  governmental  officials  such  as  the  U.S.Foreign
 Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, including but not limited to economicsanctions and
 embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees,and
 prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer ourproducts
 and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, ourinternational
 expansion  efforts,  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  employees,  our  business  and  our  operating  results.  Compliance  with  these  laws  requires  asignificant
 amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management’s attention from running our business operations and could harm ourability
 to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts. Oursuccess
 depends,  in  part,  on  our  ability  to  anticipate  these  risks  and  manage  these  difficulties.  We  monitor  our  operations  and  investigate  allegations  ofimproprieties
 relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and reportour
 findings  to  government  authorities,  and  in  some  circumstances  such  authorities  conduct  their  own  investigations  and  we  respond  to  their  requests  ordemands for information. No assurance can be given that action wi
ll not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective.We are also subject to a variety
 of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally, including those related to: 
•general economic conditions, including the latency in economic impacts and associated economic recoveries, if any, in each country or region; 
•public health risks, social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; 
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts on customer demand and our operating results; 
•difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets, in particular ourcash assets, in that country’s currency;
22

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
 
•regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that mayunexpectedly
 impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required topay in these countries;
 
•political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities; 
•common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies; 
•natural disasters; 
•the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity); 
•longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 
•overlapping tax regimes; and 
•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.The variety of risks and challenges listed above
 could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware business and thesales of our products and services in affected countries or regions.
As
 the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly tradedcompany
 in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that wewould otherwise have if these entities were
 wholly-owned subsidiaries.Any
 failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.  Our customers depend
 on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings. We may be unable to respond quicklyenough
 to  accommodate  short-term  increases  in  customer  demand  for  support  services  or  may  be  inefficient  in  our  resolution  of  customer  support  issues.Increased
 customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Any failure tomaintain
 high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality technical support, could adversely affect our reputation,our ability to sell 
our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.We
 may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors. Our  revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly 
operating results can fluctuate.For
 our Oracle Cloud Services, our actual conversion or renewal rates may differ from those used in our forecasts because this business is continuing to evolveand
 such  rates  may  be  unpredictable  which  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  long-term  results.  For  our  license  business,  we  use  a  “pipeline”  system,  acommon
 industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in that business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customerwill make a
 purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimatescan
 be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contractscan
 be very difficult to estimate. A reduction in the conversion rates, renewal rates, or in the pipeline itself, could adversely affect our business or results ofoperations.
 In particular, sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those being experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic, a slowdown in ITspending
 or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rates and renewal rates in particular periods as purchasing decisions aredelayed,
 reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rates can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscalperiod
 in  the  hope  of  obtaining  more  favorable  terms,  which  can  also  impede  our  ability  to  negotiate,  execute  and  deliver  upon  these  contracts  in  a  timelymanner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited abi
lity to predict how their pipelines23

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
will convert into
 sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition. Conversion rates and renewal rates post-acquisition may be quite differentfrom the acquired
 companies’ historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates and renewal rates can also be affected by changes in business practicesthat we implement in our newly acquired companies. These changes may negativel
y affect customer behavior. A
 substantial portion of the revenue value of our cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and asignificant
 percentage of these are larger value orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenueshortfalls
 tend  to  have  a  disproportionately  negative  impact  on  our  profitability.  The  number  of  large  license  transactions  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  hardwareproducts
 transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause ourquarterly sales, revenues and profitability to f
all significantly short of our predictions.We
 may  experience  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses.  Changes  in  currency  exchange  rates  can  adversely  affect  customer  demand  and  our  revenue  andprofitability.
     We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreigncurrencies,
 particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating resultsand cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relat
ing to Brexit, and European sovereign and other debt obligationsmay
 cause the value of the British Pound and Euro to fluctuate relative to the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening ofthe
 U.S. Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report inU.S.
 Dollars  after  converting  our  foreign  currency  results  into  U.S.  Dollars  and  in  terms  of  actual  demand  for  our  products  and  services  as  certain  of  theseproducts may become
 relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect marginson
 sales  of  our  products  in  countries  outside  of  the  U.S.  Generally,  our  reported  revenues  and  operating  results  are  adversely  affected  when  the  dollarstrengthens
 relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affectedwhen
 the  dollar  strengthens  relative  to  other  currencies  as  a  portion  of  our  consolidated  cash  and  bank  deposits,  among  other  assets,  are  held  in  foreigncurrencies and reported in U.S. Dollars.
In
 addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and oursubsidiaries
 that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged to earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizesforeign
 currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time totime.
 As part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset atleast
 in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currencytransaction
 gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses withrespect
 to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currencygains and
 losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or shouldwe
 suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on thesize
 and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whetherwe
 have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results ofoperations, financial position and cash flows.
We
 have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S. Dollar. Wecould incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationar
y.Our
 periodic  workforce  restructurings  and  reorganizations  can  be  disruptive.     We  are  currently  restructuring  our  workforce  and  in  the  past  we  haverestructured
 or  made  other  adjustments  to  our  workforce  in  response  to  management  changes,  product  changes,  performance  issues,  change  in  strategies,acquisitions and other internal
24

and
 external  considerations.  These  types  of  restructurings  have  resulted  in  increased  restructuring  costs  and  temporary  reduced  productivity  while  theemployees
 adjusted  to  their  new  roles  and  responsibilities. In  addition,  we  may  not  achieve  or  sustain  the  expected  growth,  resource  redeployment  or  costsavings
 benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions andother restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected
. We
 may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.     We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of oursenior
 management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder; our Chief Executive Officer; other members of ourexecutive
 team;  and  other  key  employees.  In  the  technology  industry,  there  is  substantial  and  continuous  competition  for  highly  skilled  business,  productdevelopment, technical and other personnel. We may also experience increased compensation costs that 
are not offset by either improved productivity or highersales.
 We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-termemployment
 or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety ofreasons, and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additi
onal departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.We
 continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available atlower
 costs.  When  we  make  adjustments  to  our  workforce,  we  may  incur  expenses  associated  with  workforce  reductions  that  delay  the  benefit  of  a  moreefficient
 workforce  structure.  We  may  also  experience  increased  competition  for  employees  in  these  countries  as  the  trend  toward  globalization  continues,which
 may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In addition, changes toimmigration and labor law po
licies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.Our
 general  compensation  program  includes  restricted  stock  units  and  performance-based  equity,  which  are  important  tools  in  attracting  and  retainingemployees
 in  our industry.  If  our stock  price  performs  poorly,  it may adversely  affect  our ability to retain  or attract  employees.  We continually  evaluate  ourcompensation
 practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equityawards granted per employee an
d granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and theamount
 of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability toretain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.
Our
 sales  to  government  clients  expose  us  to  business  volatility  and  risks,  including  government  budgeting  cycles  and  appropriations,  procurementregulations,
 governmental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.     We derive revenues from contractswith
 the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award,administration and performance of those contracts.
Governmental
 entities  are  variously  pursuing  policies  that  affect  our  ability  to  sell  our  products  and  services.  Changes  in  government  procurement  policy,prioriti
es, regulations, technology initiatives and requirements, and/or contract award criteria may negatively impact our potential for growth in the governmentsector.
 For  example,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  has  issued  cybersecurity  requirements  for  contractors’  internal  systems  through  a  mandatorycybersecurity
 contract  clause  referred  to  as  “DFArS  7012”  and  will  be  implementing  a  new  third-party  accreditation  program  known  as  the  CybersecurityMaturity
 Model  Certification  (CMMC).   The  DFArS  7012  and  CMMC  requirements  may  impact  our  lines  of  business  in  the  U.S.  federal  government  market.Compliance with these cybersecu
rity requirements is complex and costly, and failure to meet the required security controls could limit our ability to sell productsand services, directly or indirectly, to the DoD and other federal
 government entities that implement similar cybersecurity requirements.We
 are also subject to early termination of our contracts. Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time, without cause. Forexample,
 the  U.S.  federal  government  may  terminate  any  of  our  government  contracts  and  subcontracts  at  its  convenience,  or  for  default  based  on  ourperformance.
25

U.S.
 federal contracts are subject to the congressional approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts withU.S.
 state  and  local  governments,  foreign  governments  and  their  agencies  are  generally  subject  to  government  funding  authorizations.  Contracts  may  beterminated based upon a lack of appropriated funds.
There
 is  increased  pressure  on  governments  and  their  agencies,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  to  reduce  spending  as  governments  continue  to  facesignificant deficit reduction pressures. This may adversely impact spending on government programs.
Government
 contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations. If violations of law are found,they could
 result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture ofprofits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.
Acquisitio
ns present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.     We continue to
 review and  consider  strategic acquisitions of  companies,  products,  services and  technologies. We have a  selective and  active acquisition  program and  weexpect
 to continue  to make acquisitions  in the future  because  acquisitions  are an important  element  of our overall corporate  strategy.  risks we may face inconnection with our acquisition program include:
 
•our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities; 
•we may have difficulties (1) managing an acquired company’s technologies or lines of business; (2) entering new markets where we have no, orlimited,
 direct  prior  experience  or  where  competitors  may  have  stronger  market  positions;  or  (3)  retaining  key  personnel  from  the  acquiredcompanies;
 
•an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as weexpected,
 we may impose our business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpayfor,
 or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentiallycause impairment to assets that we recorded as a
 part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill; 
•our  operating  results  or  financial  condition  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  (1)  claims  or  liabilities  that  we  assume  from  an  acquired  company  ortechnology
 or  that  are  otherwise  related  to  an  acquisition,  including,  among  others,  claims  from  government  agencies,  terminated  employees,current
 or former customers, former stockholders or other third parties; (2) pre-existing contractual relationships that we assume from an acquiredcompany
 that  we would  not have  otherwise  entered  into,  the  termination  or modification  of which  may be  costly  or disruptive  to our business;(3)
 unfavorable  revenue  recognition  or  other  accounting  treatment  as  a  result  of  an  acquired  company’s  practices;  and  (4)  intellectual  propertyclaims or disputes;
 
•we  may  fail  to  identify  or  assess  the  magnitude  of  certain  liabilities,  shortcomings  or  other  circumstances  prior  to  acquiring  a  company  ortechnology, which could
 result in (1) unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, (2) unfavorable accounting treatment, (3) unexpected increases intaxes due or the loss of anticipated ta
x benefits or (4) other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition; 
•we may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including (1) if a larger than predictednumber
 of customers decline to renew cloud-based subscription contracts or license support or hardware support contracts, (2) if we are unable tosell
 the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base, (3) if acquired customers do not elect to purchase our technologies due todiffering business practices or (4) if contract models utilized by 
an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis;26

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
 
•we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines ofbusiness and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies;
 
•we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced, delivered and supported differently,which could cause customer confusion and delays;
 
•we  may  incur  higher  than  anticipated  costs  (1)  to  support,  develop  and  deliver  acquired  products  or  services,  (2)  for  general  and  administrativefunctions that support new business models, or (3) to comply with regulati
ons applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than wehad anticipated;
 
•we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed onus
 by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integrationplans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integrati
on and restructuring expenses; 
•we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, whichcould,
 among other things, (1) delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, (2) adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions,(3)
 restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition, or (4) have other adverse effects on our current businessand operations;
 
•our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including (1) stock repurchases, (2) dividend payments and (3)retirement of outstanding indebtedness, among others;
 
•we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition andwe may have
 to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timelymanner or on favorable terms;
 
•to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted andearnings per share may decrease; and
 
•we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles, including arrangements that we may assume in an acquisition.
The
 occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly inthe case of a larger acquisition or sever
al concurrent acquisitions.Our
 hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline.     Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues andoverall
 profitability and related growth rates. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardwarebusiness in a timely manner or at a
ll due to a number of factors, including: 
•our changes in hardware offerings, technologies and strategies, including shifting factory locations, which could adversely affect supply and demandfor our hardware products;
 
•our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our cloud and license business; 
•our  focus  on  certain  of  our  more  profitable  Oracle  Engineered  Systems  and  certain  other  hardware  products  we  consider  strategic  and  the  de-emphasis of certain of our lower prof
it margin commodity hardware products could adversely affect our hardware revenues; 
•changes  in  strategies  and  frequency  for  the  development  and  introduction  of  new  versions  or  next  generations  of  our  hardware  products  couldadversely affect our hardware revenues;

•general supply chain material shortages worldwide prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, which we expect will be further exacerbated globally as aresult of the virus
 pandemic ;  
•a  greater  risk  of  material  charges  that  could  adversely  affect  our  operating  results,  such  as  potential  write-downs  and  impairments  of  ourinventories;
 higher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and license and services businesses; and amortization and potentialimpairment of intangible assets associated w
ith our hardware business; 
•decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives, which could adversely affectour hardware revenues; and
 
•we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but (1) operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operatingmargins
 than our own; (2) have different  legacy business  practices  and go-to-market  strategies  than our own that we may alter as a part of ourintegration
 efforts, which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company; (3) leverage different platformsor
 competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating; or (4) utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability toscale these acquired products within our own manufacturing operations.
Our
 hardware offerings are complex products, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, the results of our hardware business will suffer.     Wedepend on suppliers to develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies
 and components for our hardware products, and there aresome
 technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints.As
 a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, naturaldisasters,
 political  unrest,  public  health  crises  such  as  the  outbreak  of  the  novel  coronavirus  COVID-19,  changes  to  trade  policies,  port  stoppages  or  othertransportation
 disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or wherethe
 products  are  being  shipped.  We  may  be  unable  to  purchase  these  items  from  the  respective  single  vendors  on  acceptable  terms  or  may  experiencesignificant
 shortages, delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor. If one or more of the risksdescribed above occurs, our hardware business and related operating results could be materially 
and adversely affected.We are susceptible to third-party manufacturing
 and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers.     We outsource the manufacturing, assembly,
 delivery and technology or component design of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside theU.S.
 From time to time, these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products. To reduce this risk, we continue toexplore additional third-party manufacturing partners to drive supply chain continuity, but finding additional
 manufacturing sources in a timely and cost-effectivemanner is
 difficult. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused a loss of sales during our fourth quarter of fiscal2020.
 Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware productsexpenses,
 all  of  which  could  adversely  affect  the  margins  of  our  hardware  business.  These  challenges  and  risks  also  exist  when  we  acquire  companies  withhardware products and related supply chain operat
ions and could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers or locations. In some cases, we may bedependent,
 at least initially, on these acquired companies’ supply chain operations or other manufacturing operations that we are less familiar with and thus wemay be slower to adjust or react t
o these challenges and risks.Our
 cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channels could affect our future operating results.     Our cloud and license, and hardware indirect channelnetwork
 is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integratorsand
 independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketingand
 sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channelparticipants were to deteriorate, if any 
of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel28

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
participant,
 if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants’ productsand
 services were to decrease. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channelparticipants. If we are not successful, we may lose s
ales opportunities, customers and revenues. We
 may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.     We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures,controls
 and  contractual  commitments  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights.  Despite  our  efforts,  these  protections  may  be  limited.  Unauthorized  thirdparties
 may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may beinvalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the
scope
 of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as dothe
 laws and courts of the U.S. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may notremain competitive.
Third
 parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions. 
   We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rightsand/or
 breach of our agreements with them. These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute productsor
 services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims ofinfringement and misuse. We expect to continue to receive such claims as:
 
•we continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies; 
•the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows; 
•the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry; 
•the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and 
•non-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments.responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:
 
•be time consuming, costly and result in litigation; 
•divert management’s time and attention from developing our business; 
•require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable; 
•require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; 
•require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms; 
•require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or 
•otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.We
 may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.     Developing  our various productofferings
 is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of ourcorporate strategy
 is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities boththrough
 internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired. Accelerated product and service introductionsand
 short lifecycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenueincreases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant 
amount of resources to our29

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
research
 and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments forseveral years
, if at all . Business disruptions could adve
rsely affect our operating results.     A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographicareas,
 some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the U.S.We
 are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems, supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providingservices, including
 some of our cloud offerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back office processes. A majorearthquake
 or fire, political, social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change(such as
 increased storm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business, supply chains or IT systemscould severely affect our ability to
 conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.Adverse
 litigation results could affect our business.     We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to ouroperations,
 and  can  divert  our  management’s  attention  away  from  running  our  core  business.  The  results  of  our  litigation  also  cannot  be  predicted  withcertainty.
 An  adverse  decision  could  result  in  monetary  damages  or  injunctive  relief  that  could  affect  our  business,  operating  results  or  financial  condition.Additional
 information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includedelsewhere in this Annual report.
We may
 have exposure to additional tax liabilities.     As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in boththe
 U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities, including those arising from potentialchanges
 in laws in the countries in which we do business and the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws. Manyjudgments
 are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by tax authorities,which
 often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impacton our tax rate.
Increasingly,
 countries  around  the  world  are  actively  considering  or  have  enacted  changes  in  relevant  tax,  accounting  and  other  laws,  regulations  andinterpretations.
 In particular, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) significantly changed how corporations are taxed in the U.S., which has anongoing
 impact on our provision for income taxes. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal revenue Service (IrS), and other standards-setting bodies arecontinuing
 to issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied and it is possible that the guidance may differ from our interpretation of thelegislation.
 The  Tax  Act  requires  complex  computations  not  previously  required  or  produced,  and  necessitates  that  we  make  significant  judgments  andassumptions in the interpretation of the law where there 
is a lack of guidance.  Such
 uncertainty in the application of the Tax Act to our ongoing operations as well as possible adverse future law changes attributable to changes in the U.S.political
 landscape create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have an adverse impact on our future tax rate.Various Democratic proposals would partially or wholly reverse beneficial features of the
 Tax Act, such as by raising the U.S. corporate tax rate and increasing thetax
 on  non-U.S.  income.   A  change  in  party  control  of  the  White  House  and  U.S.  Senate  thus  could  lead  to  dramatic  changes  in  the  tax  law  and  result  in  anincrease
 in our provision for income taxes.  Increased federal and state fiscal spending to fund COVID-19 relief measures, coupled with a drop in tax revenuefrom
 pandemic-related reductions in economic activity, will add to the pressure to raise more tax revenue from federal and state corporate income and othertaxes or to enact new types of t
axes on businesses and their customers.Other
 countries also continue to consider enacting changes to their tax laws that could adversely affect us by increasing taxes imposed on our revenue streamsand
 foreign  subsidiaries,  including  changes  in  withholding  tax  regimes  and  the  imposition  of  taxes  targeted  at  certain  technology  businesses.  Morefundamentally, longstanding international tax principles that determine each country’s right to tax
 cross-border transactions are being30

reconsidered,
 creating significant uncertainty as to the future level of corporate income tax on our international operations. This re-examination is driven by aperceived
 need to provide greater taxing rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located. Various measures are being discussed, includingadjustments
 to transfer pricing rules, limitations on deductions, and imposition of additional withholding taxes. The foregoing changes brought about by the TaxAct
 in combination with the uncertain international tax environment have upended expectations and the predictability and reliability of the global tax system,leading to the ongoing
 re-evaluation of our global legal and tax operating structure.  The resulting potential modifications to our structure could adversely impactour provision for income
 taxes.Inherent
 in  our  global  business  operations  and  legal  entity  structure  are  many  intercompany  transactions  and  calculations  made  in  the  ordinary  course  ofbusiness where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our intercompany tr
ansfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the IrS and by foreigntax
 jurisdictions  and  will  likely  be  subject  to  additional  audits  in  the  future.  Although  we  have  negotiated  a  number  of  agreements  with  certain  taxingjurisdictions,
 these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing. In recent periods, transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictionshave
 become increasingly contentious. Similarly, certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters under current law.In
 addition, our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by shifts of earnings from jurisdictions or regimes that have relatively lower statutory taxrates to those in which the rates are rel
atively higher.We
 are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the U.S. andvarious
 foreign jurisdictions that have uncertain applicability to the businesses in which we are engaged. Although we believe that our income and non-incomebased
 tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected inour historical income tax provisi
ons and accruals.There
 are  risks  associated  with  our  outstanding  and  future  indebtedness.     As  of  May  31,  2020,  we  had  an  aggregate  of  $71.6  billion  of  outstandingindebtedness
 that will mature between calendar year 2020 and calendar year 2060, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to payinterest
 and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to servicesuch debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able
 to manage any of these risks successfully.We
 may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that theterms
 of  any  refinancing  may  not  be  as  favorable  as  the  terms  of  our  existing  debt.  Furthermore,  if  prevailing  interest  rates  or  other  factors  at  the  time  ofrefinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.
Should we incur future
 increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited,which
 could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit ratingcould
 negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. Theserisks could adversely affect our financial condition 
and results of operations.Environmental
 and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.     Some  of our cloudand
 hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materialsused
 for  these  products,  human  health  and  safety,  the  use  of  certain  chemical  substances  and  the  labor  practices  of  suppliers,  as  well  as  local  testing  andlabelling requirements
. Compliance with these ever-changing environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design, development,procurement,
 manufacturing,  delivery,  cloud  operations  and  administration  costs,  limit  our  ability  to  manage  excess  and  obsolete  non-compliant  inventory,change
 our  sales  activities,  or  otherwise  impact  future  financial  results  of  our  cloud  and  hardware  businesses.  Any  violation  of  these  laws  can  subject  us  tosignificant
 liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in amaterial adverse effect on the financial condition 
or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses.31

regulatory, market, and competitive pressures regarding the 
greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations ma y also grow.The
 SEC has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) in their products. Our supplychain
 is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardware end-products, we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refiningof any
 conflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited. Ourrelationships
 with  customers  and  suppliers  could  suffer  if  we  are  unable  to  describe  our  products  as  “conflict-free.”  We  may  also  face  increased  costs  incomplying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements.
A
 significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on restriction of HazardousSubstances (roHS),
 the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China’s regulation on Management Methods for ControllingPollution
 Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU,China
 and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The UK Government hasannounced a procurement policy that includes environmental, social and economic sustainability me
asures.Our
 stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.    All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. Thetiming of announcements in
 the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new products, product enhancements, technological advances, acquisitionsor major transacti
ons could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price. Ourstock
 price  could  also  be  affected  by  factors,  some  of  which  are  beyond  our  control,  including,  among  others:  speculation  in  the  press  and  the  analystcommunity,
 changes  in  recommendations  or  earnings  estimates  by  financial  analysts,  changes  in  investors’  or  analysts’  valuation  measures  for  our  stock,negative
 analyst surveys or channel check surveys, earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors’ expectations, ourcredit
 ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actionlawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely
 affect our business.We
 cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.   In  fiscal 2020, ourBoard
 of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $30.0 billion. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date andwe are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or doll
ar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, evenif fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.
Charges
 to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.     Under business combination accounting standards pursuant toAccounting
 Standards  Codification  (ASC)  805, Business  Combinations,  we  recognize  the  identifiable  assets  acquired,  the  liabilities  assumed  and  any  non-controlling
 interests  in  acquired  companies  generally  at  their  acquisition  date  fair  values  and,  in  each  case,  separately  from  goodwill.  Goodwill  as  of  theacquisition
 date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisitiondate
 amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonablebut
 which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operatingresults and may adversely affect our cash flo
ws: 
•costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeploymentor relocation expenses;
 
•impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets; 
•amortization of intangible assets acquired; 
•a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;32

•identification of, or changes  to, assumed contingent  liabilities, both  income tax and  non-income tax related, after our final determination of theamounts
 for  these  contingencies  or  the  conclusion  of  the  measurement  period  (generally  up  to  one  year  from  the  acquisition  date),  whichevercomes first;
 
•charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activitiesfor
 a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, and charges to restructureour operations or to reduce our cost structure;
 
•charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and 
•charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition.Substantially all of these costs 
will be accounted for as expenses that will adversely impact our operating results for the periods in which those costs are incurred.Charges
 to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and theextent
 of integration activities. A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the “Critical AccountingPolicies

Our
 Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019 and March 12, 2020, we announcedthat
 our  Board  of  Directors  approved  expansions  of  our  stock  repurchase  program  totaling  $30.0  billion.  As  of  May  31,  2020,  approximately  $16.6  billionremained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
Our
 stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capitalneeds, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and
 economicand
 market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stockrepurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

Selecte d Financial Data The
 following table sets forth selected financial data as of and for our last five fiscal years. This selected financial data should be read in conjunction with theconsolidated
 financial statements  and related notes included  in Item 15 of this Annual  report. Over our last five fiscal years, we have acquired  a number  ofcompanies,
 including NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) in fiscal 2017. The results of our acquired companies have been included in our consolidated financial statementssince their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our revenues, income, earnings per share and total

Our  net  income  and  diluted  earnings  per  share  were  impacted  in  fiscal  2019  and  2018  by  the  effects  of  our  adoption  of  the  U.S.  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  of  2017  (the  Tax  Act).  The  more  significantprovisions of the Tax Act as applicab
le to us are described in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.(2)
Working  capital and total assets increased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2020 net income and the issuance of $20.0 billion oflong-term
 senior notes in fiscal 2020, partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in fiscal 2020. Working capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019primarily
 due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments, partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assetsresulting
 from our fiscal 2019 net income. Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in the fiscal 2016 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net currentassets
 resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion in fiscal 2018 and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017. These workingcapital
 and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2016 to 2018 periods presented. In addition,our total assets were also affected
 in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below.(3)
Our  notes payable and other borrowings,  which represented the summation of our notes payable, current, and notes payable and other borrowings,  non-current, as reported per our consolidatedbalance
 sheets as of  the  dates listed in  the  table above,  increased during  fiscal 2020  primarily  due  to  the  issuance of  $20.0  billion of  long-term  senior  notes.   Notes  payable and  other  borrowingsdecreas
ed during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain short-term borrowings and senior notes. Notes payable and other borrowings increased between fiscal 2016 and 2018 primarily dueto
 the  fiscal  2018  issuance  of  long-term  senior  notes  of  $10.0  billion  and  short-term  borrowings  of  $2.5  billion,  the  fiscal  2017  issuance  of  long-term  senior  notes  of  $14.0  billion  and  short-termborrowings
 of  $3.8  billion,  and  fiscal  2016  short-term  borrowings  of  $3.8  billion.  See  Note  7  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report  for  additionalinformation regarding our notes payable and other borrowings.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  Results of OperationsWe begin
 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. Thisoverview
 is  followed  by  a  summary  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  that  we  believe  are  important  to  understanding  the  assumptions  andjudgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed ana
lysis of our results of operations and financial condition.Business Overview
Oracle
 provides  products  and  services  that  address  enterprise  information technology  (IT)  environments.  Our  products  and  services  include  applications  andinfrastructure
 offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on‑ premisedeployments, cloud
‑ based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud‑ based deployment) such as our OracleCloud
 at  Customer  offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer’s  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility to  our  customers  andfacilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our worldwide sa
les force and Oracle Partner Network,we sell to customers all 
over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.We
 have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as apart
 of  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  results  of  Operations  and  the  information  contained  within  Note  15  of  Notes  toConsolidated
 Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segmentsand align to how our chief operating decision makers 
(CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating resultsand allocate resources.
Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on 
Oracle’s BusinessFor a
 discussion of the impacts on and risks to our business from COVID-19, please refer to “Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business” included inItem
 1  Business  in  this  Annual  report,  the  risks  included  in  Item  1A  risk  Factors  in  this  Annual  report  and  the  information  presented  below  in  results  ofOperations in this Item 7.
Cloud and License Business
Our cloud and
 license line of business, which represented 83% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrumof applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings.
Cloud services and license support revenues include:
 
•license support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support servicesin
 connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments.Substantially
 all  license  support  customers  renew  their  support  contracts  with  us  upon  expiration  in  order  to  continue  to  benefit  from  technicalsupport
 services  and  the  periodic  issuance  of  unspecified  updates  and  enhancements,  which  current  license  support  customers  are  entitled  toreceive.
 License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise
 license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and aregenerally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual peri
od that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and 
•cloud services revenues, which provide customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deploymentmodels
 that  Oracle  develops,  provides  unspecified  updates  and  enhancements  for,  hosts,  manages  and  supports  and  that  customers  access  byentering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. The major
ity of our Oracle Cloud Services37

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
 
arrangements are generally billed  in advance of the cloud services being performed; have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed at the
 customer’s option;  and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usagemodel contracts, as the cloud services are consumed
 over time . Cloud
 license  and  on-premise  license  revenues  include  revenues  from  the  licensing  of  our  software  products  including  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database,Oracle
 Middleware  and  Java,  among  others,  which  our  customers  deploy  within  cloud‑ based, on‑ premise  and  other  IT  environments.  Our  cloud  license  andon
‑premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made availableto the customer to download and use. revenues from usage
‑ based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at thepoint
 in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues dueto
 the point in time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud servicesand
 license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customershave the option to purchase and renew license support contracts as described above.
Providing choice and
 flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of ourcorporate
 strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services hasincreased.
 To  address  customer  demand  and  enable  customer  choice,  we  have  introduced  certain  programs  for  customers  to  pivot  their  applications  andinfrastructure
 licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for theirexisting workloads. We expect these trends to continue.
Our
 cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmentalbudgetary
 constraints;  the  strategy  for  and  competitive  position  of  our  offerings;  the  continued  renewal  of  our  cloud  services  and  license  support  customercontracts by
 the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases;the
 pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; andforeign currency rate fluctuations.
On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and l
icense revenues generally will continue to increase due to: 
•expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; and 
•continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings.We
 believe  these  factors  should  contribute  to  future  growth  in  our  cloud  and  license  business’  revenues,  which  should  enable  us  to  continue  to  makeinvestments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services.
Our
 cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historicalupward trend
 of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixedin
 the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year isprimaril
y due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably;the
 renewal  of  existing  customers’  cloud  services  and  license  support  contracts  over  the  course  of  each  fiscal  year  that  we  generally  recognize  as  revenuesratably;
 and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; ineach case over those four quarterly periods.

Hardware Business
Our
 hardware  business,  which  represented  9%  of  our  total  revenues  in  each  of  fiscal  2020  and  2019,  provides  a  broad  selection  of  hardware  products  andhardware-related
 software  products  including  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage,  industry-specific  hardware  offerings,  operating  systems,virtualization,
 management and other hardware-related software, and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as anoperating
 system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for thiscombined performance obligati
on are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customerand ownership is
 transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and servicesand
 to  develop  new  hardware  products  and  services.  The  majority  of  our  hardware  products  are  sold  through  indirect  channels,  including  independentdistributors
 and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that areessential to
 the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware support offerings can also includeproduct
 repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer,are
 generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services aredelivered over the contractual terms.
We
 generally  expect  our  hardware  business  to  have  lower  operating  margins  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  than  our  cloud  and  license  business  due  to  theincremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.
Our
 quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affectedby
 many factors, including our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardwareproducts
 relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economicand
 business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to thetime
 of hardware product  sale; the percentage  of our hardware support  contract  customer base that renews its support  contracts and  the close associationbetween
 hardware  products,  which  have  a  finite  life,  and  customer  demand  for  related  hardware  support  as  hardware  products  age;  customer  decisions  toeither maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newl
y developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Services Business
Our
 services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, helps customers and partners maximize the performance oftheir
 investments  in  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies.  We  believe  that  our  services  are  differentiated  based  on  our  focus  on  Oracletechnologies,
 extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services, advanced customerservices and education services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and l
icense and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affectedby many factors including, our strategy for, and the competitive positi
on of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings andthe
 associated  services  for  these  offerings;  general  economic  conditions;  governmental  budgetary  constraints;  personnel  reductions  in  our  customers’  ITdepartments; and tighter controls over customer discretionary spending.
Acquisitions
Our selective and active acquisiti
on program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire anumber
 of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. The pace of our acquisitions has slowed recently, but as compelling opportunitiesbecome available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corpor
ate strategy. Note 2 of39

 Annual report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We
 believe  that  we  can  fund  our  future  acquisitions  with  our  internally  available  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities,  cash  generated  fromoperations,
 additional  borrowings  or  from  the  issuance  of  additional  securities.  We  estimate  the  financial  impact  of  any  potential  acquisition  with  regard  toearnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move f

 consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  set  forth  in  the  FinancialAccounting
 Standards  Board’s  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the  various  staff  accounting  bulletins  and  other  applicableguidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estim
ates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates,judgments
 and  assumptions  upon  which  we  rely  are  reasonable  based  upon  information  available  to  us  at  the  time  that  these  estimates,  judgments  andassumptions
 are made. These estimates, judgments  and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financialstatements
 as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between theseestimates,
 judgments  or  assumptions  and  actual  results,  our  financial  statements  will  be  affected.  The  accounting  policies  that  reflect  our  more  significantestimates,
 judgments  and  assumptions  and  which  we  believe  are  the  most  critical  to  aid  in  fully  understanding  and  evaluating  our  reported  financial  resultsinclude:
 
•revenue recognition;  
•Business Combinations;  
•Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments;  
•Accounting for Income Taxes; and  
•Legal and Other Contingencies. Our
 senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Note
 1  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report  includes  additional  information  about  our  critical  and  otheraccounting policies.
Revenue Recognition
The
 most critical judgments required in applying Topic 606 and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligationsand the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP
) for each performance obligation.Many
 of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within acustomer
 contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multipleproducts
 and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. Weallocat
e the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below)for each performance obligation within each
 contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customercontract as revenue as each performance obligation is delivered.
We
 use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performanceobligati
ons except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separatelyin
 comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis orwhen facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can
40

evolve
 over  time  due  to  changes  in  our  pricing  practices  that  are  influenced  by  intense  competition,  changes  in  demand  for  our  products  and  services,  andeconomic
 factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customerselect
 to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paidby
 the customer to access the license. We are unable to establish the  SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given thesame products are sold for a broad range of 
amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactionsor
 other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations isdetermined
 by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction pricebased upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price 
allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues. Business Combinations
We apply the
 provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations , in  accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertainsto
 an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conductedand
 managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individualassets
 and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assetsacquired and
 the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferredover the
 net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accuratelyvalue
 assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date  as  well  as  any  contingent  consideration,  where  applicable,  our  estimates  are  inherentlyuncertain
 and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we recordadjustments
 to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  with  the  corresponding  offset  to  goodwill.  Upon  the  conclusion  of  a  business  acquisition’smeasurement
 period  or  final  determination  of  the  values  of  assets  acquired  or  liabilities  assumed,  whichever  comes  first,  any  subsequent  adjustments  arerecorded to our consolidated statements of operations.
Accounting
 for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including ourestimates for
 intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although webelieve that the assumptions and estima
tes we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience andinformation
 obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur thatmay affect the accuracy or validity 
of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.For
 a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation ofthese
 pre-acquisition  contingencies  throughout  the  measurement  period  in  order  to  obtain  sufficient  information  to  assess  whether  we  include  thesecontingencies as a part of the fair value estim
ates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.If
 we  cannot  reasonably  determine  the  fair  value  of  a  non-income  tax  related  pre-acquisition  contingency  by  the  end  of  the  measurement  period,  which  isgenerally the
 case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an assetexisted
 or  a  liability  had  been  incurred  at  the  acquisition  date  and  (2)  the  amount  of  the  asset  or  liability  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Subsequent  to  themeasurement
 period  or  final  determination  of  the  net  asset  values  for  the  business  combination,  changes  in  our  estimates  of  such  contingencies  will  affectearnings and could have a material effect on our results 
of operations and financial position.In
 addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. Wereevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and

circumstances
 that  existed  as  of  the  acquisition  date  with  any  adjustments  to  our  preliminary  estimates  being  recorded  to  goodwill  if  identified  within  themeasurement
 period. Subsequent  to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichevercomes
 first,  changes  to  these  uncertain  tax  positions  and  tax  related  valuation  allowances  will  affect  our  provision  for  income  taxes  in  our  consolidatedstatement of operations and could have a materi
al impact on our results of operations and financial position.Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessme
ntsWe
 review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We makecertain
 judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each ofour reporting units.
Judgment in t
he assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, andother
 factors;  entity  specific  factors;  industry  and  market  considerations,  macroeconomic  conditions,  and  other  relevant  events  and  factors  affecting  thereporting unit.
 To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative testis then performed.
Performing
 a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test  includes  the  determination  of  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  and  involves  significant  estimates  andassumptions.
 These  estimates  and  assumptions  include,  among  others,  revenue  growth  rates  and  operating  margins  used  to  calculate  projected  future  cashflows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate m
arket comparables.We
 make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairmentmay
 exist.  In  such  situations,  we  are  required  to  evaluate  whether  the  net  book  values  of  our  finite  lived  intangible  assets  are  recoverable.  We  determinewhether
 finite  lived  intangible  assets  are  recoverable  based  upon  the  forecasted  future  cash  flows  that  are  expected  to  be  generated  by  the  lowest  levelassociated
 asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective andinclude,
 among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by avariety
 of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internalforecasts.
Accounting for Income T
axesJudgment
 is  required  in  determining  our  worldwide  income  tax  provision.  In  the  ordinary  course  of  a  global  business,  there  are  many  transactions  andcalculations
 where  the  ultimate  tax  outcome  is  uncertain.  Some  of  these  uncertainties  arise  as  a  consequence  of  revenue  sharing  and  cost  reimbursementarrangements
 among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregationof
 foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of thesematters
 could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on ourincome tax provision and net income in the period in 
which such determination is made.We
 record  a  valuation  allowance  to  reduce  our  deferred  tax  assets  to  the  amount  that  is  more  likely  than  not  to  be  realized.  In  order  for  us  to  realize  ourdeferred
 tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider futuregrowth,
 forecasted earnings,  future taxable income, the  mix of earnings in the  jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prioryears,
 if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the eventwe
 were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assetsvaluation
 allowance  would  be  charged  to  earnings  in  the  period  in  which  we  make  such  a  determination,  or  goodwill  would  be  adjusted  at  our  finaldetermination
 of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that thenet deferred tax assets would be
42

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
realized,
 we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at suchtime.
We
 calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returnsfiled
 during  the  subsequent  year.  Adjustments  based  on  filed  returns  are  generally  recorded  in  the  period  when  the  tax  returns  are  filed  and  the  global  taximplications are known, which can materiall
y impact our effective tax rate.The
 amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Ourestimate of the
 potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax relatedcontingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” 
above.For
 those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes , which
 contains  a  two-step  approach  to  recognizing  and  measuring  uncertain  tax  positions  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.  The  first  step  is  todetermine if the weight of avai
lable evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of anyrelated
 appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized uponultimate
 settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the finaloutcome
 of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicialrulings, and refinement
 of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these mattersis
 different than  the  amounts recorded,  such  differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the  period in which  such  a determination ismade.
 Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include therelated interest and penalties.
Legal and Other Contingencies
We
 are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financialexposure.
 A  description  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  contingencies  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  is  provided  under  “BusinessCombinations”
 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potentialloss
 from  any  claim  or  legal  proceeding  is  considered  probable,  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  both  thedetermination
 of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to thesematters,
 accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassessthe
 potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities couldhave a material impact on our results
 of operations and financial position.Results of Operations

Constant Currency Presentation
Our
 international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As aresult,
 each businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against majorinternational
 currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency ratefluctuations,
 we  compare  the  percent  change  in  the  results  from  one  period  to  another  period  in  this  Annual  report  using  constant  currency  disclosure.  Topresent
 this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollarsat constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2019, which was the last da
y of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effectduring
 the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2020 and 2019, ourfinancial
 statements  would reflect  reported  revenues  of $1.10  million in fiscal 2020  (using 1.10 as the month-end  average exchange  rate for the period) and$1.11
 million in fiscal 2019 (using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translatethe
 fiscal 2020 results using the fiscal 2019 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during either period. In each of the tables below,we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.

Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa Excluding
 the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues were flat in fiscal 2020. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’revenues
 during fiscal 2020 was offset by decreases in our hardware business’ revenues and services business’ revenues. The constant currency increase in ourcloud
 and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues ascustomers
 purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud deployment models and license deployment models and renewed their relatedcloud
 contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technologies and support services. The constant currency decrease in ourhardware business’
 revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was due to reductions in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenuesprimarily
 due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes ofcertain of our hardware prod
uct lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts. The constant currency decrease inour
 services business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to declines in our consulting revenues and education revenues. Due tothe
 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, all three of our businesses’ revenues were adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and some of theseeffects
 may continue into fiscal 2021. While we expect these effects to be temporary, the impacts of COVID-19 for fiscal 2021 and future periods are unknown.On a constant currency basis, fiscal 2020 total revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacif
ic regions were partially offset by a decline in the Americas region.Excluding
 the  effects  of  currency  rate  fluctuations,  our  total  operating  expenses  decreased  during  fiscal  2020  relative  to  fiscal  2019  primarily  due  to  lowerexpenses
 for  substantially  all  of  our  operating  expense  categories  other  than  cloud  services  and  license  support  expenses,  which  increased  primarily  due  toheadcount
 and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; and research and developmentexpenses,
 which increased primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses. We curtailed a number of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter offiscal 2020 including marketing

 and employee travel expenses in response to COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses to normalize in future periods provided  global economic conditions improve
. In

In  connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, wedid
 not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entitiesupon
 delivery  of  the  contractual  obligations.  To  the  extent  customers  for  which  these  contractual  obligations  pertain  renew  these  contracts  with  us,  we  expect  to  recognize  revenues  for  the  fullcontracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods.

 of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items; and, for fiscal 2019, after excluding a tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferredtax
 asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure and a tax benefit as described in footnote (7) below, resulted in effective tax rates of 18.4% and 18.5% in fiscal 2020 and 2019,respectively, instead of 16.0% and 9.7%, respectively, which represented our effective t
ax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations.(
7)The  fiscal 2019 income tax reform adjustment presented in the table above was due to an adjustment made pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) related to the enactment of theU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). Th
e more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.Cloud and License Business
Our
 cloud  and  license  business  engages  in  the  sale  and  marketing  of  our  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  that  are  delivered  through  variousdeployment
 models and include:  Oracle license  support  offerings;  Oracle Cloud Services  offerings;  and Oracle cloud license  and on-premise  license  offerings.License
 support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchasedby
 our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud servicesdeliver
 applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updatesand
 enhancements for, host, manage and support. revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one tothree
 years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earnedfrom
 granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud andon-premise
 IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download anduse.
 We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to marketcertain
 of  our  offerings  through  indirect  channels.  Costs  associated  with  our  cloud  and  license  business  are  included  in  cloud  services  and  license  supportexpenses,
 and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services andlicense support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sa
les force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.47

 the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to growth inour
 cloud services and license support revenues, which was primarily due to increased customer purchases and renewals of cloud-based services and licensesupport
 contracts in recent periods for which we delivered such services during fiscal 2020. Our cloud and license business’ revenues were adversely impactedduring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to
 the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular our cloud license and on-premise license revenues. In constant currency, theAmericas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 8%, 34% and 58%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2020.
In
 constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to higher cloud services and licensesupport
 expenses during fiscal 2020, which were primarily attributable to higher employee related expenses and higher technology infrastructure expenses tosupport
 the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower sales and marketingexpenses,
 which were primarily due to our curtailment of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, including reduced marketing expenses andemployee travel expenses, in response to COVID-19.

Excluding
 the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’  total margin increased in fisca l  2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due  to the fiscal2020 increases in revenues for this business, while total fiscal 2020 margins as a percentage of revenues rema
ined flat. Hardware Business
Our
 hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. Thehardware
 product  and  related  software,  such  as  an  operating  system  or  firmware,  are  highly  interdependent  and  interrelated  and  are  accounted  for  as  acombined
 performance  obligation.  The  revenues  for  this  combined  performance  obligation  are  generally  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  that  the  hardwareproduct
 is  delivered  to  the  customer  and  ownership  is  transferred  to  the  customer.  Our  hardware  business  also  earns  revenues  from  the  sale  of  hardwaresupport
 contracts purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are deliveredover
 the  contractual  term,  which  is  generally  one  year.  The  majority  of  our  hardware  products  are  sold  through  indirect  channels  such  as  independentdistributor
s and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with ourhardware
 business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internalmanufacturing operations or
 by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact ofinventory
 determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide supportservices; and
 sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of ourhardware offerings.

 the  effects  of  currency  rate  fluctuations,  total  hardware  revenues  decreased  in  fiscal  2020  relative  to  fiscal  2019  due  to  lower  hardware  productsrevenues

 attributable  to  our  continued  emphasis  on  the  marketing  and  sale  of  our  cloud-based  infrastructure  technologies,  which  resulted  in  reduced  salesvolumes
 of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Our hardware business’revenues were also adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the economic effects caused by COVID-19. These unfavorable

 the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to declines  in ourconsulting services and education services revenues.
 Our services business revenues were also adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due tothe
 impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts of consulting project delays due to customer resource constraints and jurisdictional restrictions imposed withrespect
 to  in-person  meetings.  In  addition,  we  incurred  lower  billable  travel  expenses  and  lower  billable  sub-contractor  expenses  for  which  we  were  to  bereimbursed by our customers, which reduced the amount of revenues and expenses we reported for this business during fiscal 2020.
In
 constant  currency,  total  services  expenses  were  flat  in  fiscal  2020  compared  to  fiscal  2019  as  lower  expenses  incurred  for  travel  and  sub-contractors  asdescribed

Working capital
:  The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2020 in comparison to May 31, 2019 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term
 senior notes in April 2020 (refer to recent Financing Activities below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resultingfrom
 our net income during fiscal 2020 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cashused
 for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $1.0 billion and €1.25 billion of long-term senior notes as current liabilities, cash used to paydividends
 to our stockholders during fiscal 2020, and the prospective recognition of current operating lease liabilities associated with our adoption of Topic 842as
 of June 1, 2019. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which arevariable
. Cash,
 cash equivalents and marketable securities:  Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper andother
 securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase incash,
 cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2020 in comparison to May 31, 2019 was primarily due to our  issuance of $20.0 billion of long-termsenior
 notes in April 2020, cash  inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises during fiscal 2020. These cash inflows werepartially offset by certain cash outfl
ows, primarily $19.2 billion used for repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $4.5 billion of borrowings, paymentsof cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures.
The
 amount  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  that  we  report  in  U.S.  Dollars  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  cash,  cash  equivalents  andmarketable
 securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as ofthe

 that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2020 relative to what we would have reported usingconstant currency rates from the May 31, 2019 balance sheet date.

 $(6,132 )  -85%  $(42,056 ) Cash
 flows from operating activities:  Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal oftheir
 license support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms,which
 are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services,hardware
 offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturingcosts related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and le
ased facilities.Net
 cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower net income and certain cash unfavorablechanges
 in the  timing of payments  received  from customers  during  the  fourth  quarter  of fiscal  2020,  which  we believe  were attributable  to the  unfavorableglobal economic effects that resulted from COVID-19. We expect to col

 flows from investing activities:  The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales ofour investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, 
including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.54

Net 
cash  provided  by  investing  activities  decreased  during  fiscal  2020  primarily  due  to  a fiscal  2020 decrease  in  proceeds  from  the  maturities  and  sales  ofmarketable

 flows  from  financing  activities:  The  changes  in  cash  flows  from  financing  activities  primarily  relate  to  borrowings  and  repayments  related  to  our  debtinstruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.
Net
 cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in our stock repurchases for which weused $19.2 billion in fiscal 2020 in comparison to $36.1 billion in fiscal 2019; and our fisca

:  To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis toanalyze
 cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with ourcompetitors.
 The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of ourperformance, or as an alternative to cash fl
ows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:

 Customer  Financing:  We  offer  certain  of  our  customers  the  option  to  acquire  licenses,  cloud  services,  hardware  and  services  offerings  throughseparate
 long-term  payment  contracts.  We  generally  sell  these  contracts  that  we  have  financed  for  our  customers  on  a  non-recourse  basis  to  financialinstitutions
 within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions assales
 of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.0 billion in each of fiscal2020
 and 2019 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2018 or approximately 19%, 17% and 25%, respectively, of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues in fiscal2020, 2019 and 2018
, respectively.Recent Financing Activities
: Cash Dividends
:  In fiscal 2020, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.96 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2020, our Board of Directors declared aquarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 28, 2020 to stockholders of record as
 of the close of business on July15,
 2020. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board ofDirectors.
Senior Notes
:  In April 2020, we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following:                                 
•$3.50 billion of 2.50% senior notes due April 2025;     
•$2.25 billion of 2.80% senior notes due April 2027;                     
•$3.25 billion of 2.95% senior notes due April 2030;     
•$3.00 billion of 3.60% senior notes due April 2040;  
•$4.50 billion of 3.60% senior notes due April 2050; and  55

•$3.50 billion of 3.85% senior notes due April 2060. We
 issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repaymentof
 indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2020, we repaid $4.5 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regardingour senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to C
onsolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.Common Stock Repurch
ase Program:  Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019and
 March 12, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $30.0 billion. As ofMay
 31, 2020, approximately $16.6 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 361.0 millionshares
 for $19.2 billion, 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion, and 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our stockrepurchase
 authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, ourcash
 requirements  for  acquisitions  and  dividend  payments,  our  debt  repayment  obligations  or  repurchases  of  our  debt,  our  stock  price,  and  economic  andmarket
 conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stockrepurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
  Contractual
 Obligations:  The  contractual  obligations  presented  in  the  table  below  represent  our  estimates  of  future  payments  under  our  fixed  contractualobligations
 and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual paymentsdiffering
 from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the mostsignificant
 assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Thefollowing is a summary

external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing offinished
 hardware  products.  We  also  obtain  individual  hardware  components  for  our  products  from  a  variety  of  individual  suppliers  based  on  projected  demand  information.  Such  purchasecommitments
 are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times forthe particular part or product and have been included
 in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to ourexternal
 manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into inorder to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a mean
ingful way.As of May 31, 2020, we had $8.4 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated ba
lancesheet,
 and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled orreleased
 with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal2021.
 We are involved in claims and legal proceedings. All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due tothe
 uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of whichare
 out of our control. Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report includes additional informationregarding these contingencies.
We
 believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital,capital
 expenditures  and  contractual  obligation  requirements.  In  addition,  we  believe  that  we  could  fund  our  future  acquisitions,  dividend  payments  andrepurchases
 of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additionalborrowings or from the issuance of additional
 securities.Off-Balance
 Sheet Arrangements:  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect onour
 financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that arematerial to investors.

Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options
Our
 stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employeesand align their interests with the interests of exist
ing stockholders.We
 recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awardsgranted
 while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2017 has been aweighted-a
verage annualized rate of 1.5% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awardsand
 stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by theweighted-average
 outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest andstock
 options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2020, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, substantially all have exerciseprices
 lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect ofour
 stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, includingthe
 amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2020, themaximum
 potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless ofwhether vested or unvested 
and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date , was 9.0%. During
 fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants toselected
 employees;  all  stock-based  award  grants  to  senior  officers;  and  any  individual  grant  of  restricted  stock  units  of  62,500  or  greater.  The  annualorganization-wide
 stock-based award grants to selected employees are generally approved by the Compensation Committee during the ten business day periodfollow
ing the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. However, we currently do not expect that the annual grantfor
 fiscal  2021  will  be  approved  during  this  time  period.  Each  member  of  a  separate  executive  officer  committee,  referred  to  as  the  Plan  Committee,  wasallocated
 a fiscal 2020 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitationsestablished by the Compensation Committee.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For information with respect to
 recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, ifany, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated F
inancial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About Market RiskCash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and
 Interest Income RiskCash,
 cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $43.1 billion and $37.8 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our bank deposits and timedeposits
 are  generally  held  with  large,  diverse  financial  institutions  worldwide  with  high  investment-grade  credit  ratings  or  financial  institutions  that  meetinvestment-grade
 ratings  criteria,  which  we  believe  mitigates  credit  risk  and  certain  other  risks.  In  addition,  as  of  May  31,  2020,  substantially  all  of  ourmarketabl
e securities were high quality with substantially all having maturity dates within one year (a description of our marketable securities held is included inNotes
 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report and “Liquidity and Capital resources” above). We held amix of both fixed and
 floating-rate debt securities. Fixed rate securities may have their market values adversely impacted as interest rates increase, while floatingrate
 securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may vary due to changesin
 interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because weclassify
 our  debt  securities  as  “available  for  sale,”  no  gains  or  losses  are  recognized  due  to  changes  in  interest  rates  unless  such  securities  are  sold  prior  tomaturity
 or  declines  in  fair  value  are  determined  to  be  other-than-temporary.  The  fair  values  of  our  fixed-rate  debt  securities  are  impacted  by  interest  ratemovements
 and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of each of May 31, 2020 and 2019 we estimate the change would have decreasedthe fair values of our marketable securities
 holdings by $15 million and $128 million, respectively. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes.Changes
 in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal2020
 and  2019,  total  interest  income  was  $527  million  and  $1.1  billion,  respectively,  with  our  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  investmentsyielding an average 1.47% and 2.08%, respectively, on a worldwide basis.

Interest Expense Risk
Interest Expense Risk
— Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap AgreementsOur
 total borrowings were $71.6 billion as of May 31, 2020, consisting of $71.5 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings. As of May31, 2020, we held certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-
interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billionof
 2.80% fixed-rate senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes), so that the fixed-rate interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable basedon
 LIBOr. We have also entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our €750million
 of 3.125% fixed-rate senior notes due July 2025 Notes (July 2025 Notes) by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated debt, including theannual interest payments and t
he payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOr. The critical terms of the swapagreements
 match  the  critical  terms  of  the  July  2021  Notes  and  July  2025  Notes  that  the  swap  agreements  pertain  to,  including  the  notional  amounts  andmaturity
 dates. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes. We are accounting for these swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant toASC
 815, Derivatives  and Hedging (ASC  815). The fair values of our outstanding fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2020 and 2019were a $12 million net gain and a $17 million net loss, respect
ively. We estimate that the changes in the fair values of these swap agreements as of May 31, 2020and
 2019, respectively, were primarily attributable to a decrease and increase, respectively, in forward interest rate prices. If LIBOr-based interest rates wouldhave
 been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, the change would have decreased the collective fair values of the fixed to variable swapagreements by $63 million and $90 million, respectively.
By
 entering  into  the  aforementioned  swap  arrangements,  we  have  assumed  risks  associated  with  variable  interest  rates  based  upon  LIBOr.  Changes  in  theoverall
 level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysisis
 used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2020and
 2019,  if  LIBOr-based  interest  rates  would  have  been  higher  by  100  basis  points,  the  change  would  have  increased  our  interest  expense  annually  byapproximately
 $24 million and $52 million, respectively, as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and related borrowings, and as ofMay
 31, 2019, as it related to our floating-rate borrowings. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
included elsewhere in this Annual report.Currency Risk
Foreign Currency Transaction Risk
— Foreign Currency Forward ContractsWe
 transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risksassociated
 with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or
 decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolati
lity associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany
 sublicense  fees,  intercompany  loans  and  other  intercompany  transactions.  Our  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  generally  short-term  induration.
We
 neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant toASC
 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fairvalues
 recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant.The
 balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealizedgain position and other current liabilities for
 forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for60

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
 
changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-
operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.We expect that we will continue to rea
lize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forwardcontracts.
 Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactionsthat we
 enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currencyforward
 contracts and other factors. The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major internationalcurrencies were $4.2
 billion and $3.8 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollarsin
 exchange  for  other  major  international  currencies  were  $3.9  billion  and  $3.3  billion  as  of  May  31,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  The  fair  values  of  ouroutstanding
 foreign  currency  forward  contracts  were  nominal  at  May  31,  2020  and  2019.  Net  foreign  exchange  transaction  losses  included  in  non-operatingincome,
 net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $185 million and $111 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a largeportion
 of our  consolidated operations are international,  we could  experience  additional foreign currency  volatility in  the  future,  the  amounts  and  timing ofwhich are unknown.
Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents 
and Marketable SecuritiesFluctuations
 in  foreign  currencies  impact  the  amount  of  total  assets  and  liabilities  that  we  report  for  our  foreign  subsidiaries  upon  the  translation  of  theseamounts
 into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion ofthe
 cash  held  by  these  subsidiaries  is  subject  to  translation  variance  caused  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  as  of  the  end  of  each  respectivereporting period (the offset to which is substantially
 recorded to AOCL on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidatedstatements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual report).
As
 the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2020, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesthat we reported in
 U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2020 decreased relative to what we would have reportedusing
 a constant currency rate from May 31, 2019. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes onour
 reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars was a decrease of $125 million and $158 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. If overallforeign currency exchange rate
s in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10% as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019 the amount ofcash,
 cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  we  would  report  in  U.S.  Dollars  would  have  decreased  by  approximately  $491  million  and  $434  million,respectively, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.

 within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  PrincipalExecutive and Financial Officer as appropriate t
o allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
 ReportingOur management is responsible for establish
ing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act rules13a-15(f)
 and  15d-15(f).  Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  including  our  Principal  Executive  and  Financial  Officer,  weconducted
 an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 framework. Our internal control overfinancial
 reporting  includes  policies  and  procedures  that  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  offinancial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. 
GAAP.Based
 on  the  results  of  our  evaluation,  our  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  May  31,  2020.  Wereviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.
The
 effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered publicaccounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial R
eportingThere
 were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Actrules
 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controlover financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our
 management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financialreporting
 are  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  of  achieving  their  objectives  and  are  effective  at  the  reasonable  assurance  level.  However,  ourmanagement
 does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Acontrol
 system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system aremet.
 Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative totheir
 costs.  Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  in  all  control  systems,  no  evaluation  of  controls  can  provide  absolute  assurance  that  all  control  issues  andinstances
 of  fraud,  if  any,  have  been  detected.  These  inherent  limitations  include  the  realities  that  judgments  in  decision-making  can  be  faulty  and  thatbreakdowns
 can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion oftwo
 or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about thelikelihood
 of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; overtime,
 controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because ofthe inherent limitations in a cost-effective control
 system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.62

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
Oracle CorporationOpinion on the Financial Statements
We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation (the Company) as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidatedstatements of operations, comprehensive income,
 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2020, the related notes and thefinancial
 statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statementspresent
 fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows foreach of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles.We
 also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internalcontrol
 over  financial  reporting  as  of  May  31,  2020,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway C
ommission (2013 framework) and our report dated June 22, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion
These
 financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company’s  financialstatements based
 on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company inaccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
 and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance
 about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing proceduresto
 assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.Such
 procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  includedevaluating
 the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financialstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reas
onable basis for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matter
 
The critical audit matter communicated
 below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required tobe
 communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  ourespecially
 challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financialstatements,
 taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or onthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

 Legal Contingencies Description of the
matter
 As discussed in  Note 17 of the financial statements, the Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings. The Companyaccrues
 a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and theamount
 can be reasonably estimated. For purposes of disclosure, the Company also performs an assessment of the materiality oflegal contingencies where a loss is either reasonabl
y possible or it is reasonably possible that an exposure to loss exists in excess ofthe amount accrued.
The
 audit  of  the  Company’s  accounting  for  and  disclosure  of  legal  contingencies  is  highly  subjective  and  requires  significantjudgment
 in assessing the Company’s evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the estimated amount or range of loss.  Thesejudgments
 are impacted by uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of the legal contingencies, the status of the litigation orthe appeals processes, and the status of any settlement discussions associated w
ith the legal contingencies.How we addressed the
matter in our audit
 We obtained an understanding, ev aluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the identificationand
 evaluation of these matters, including controls over management’s assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss andwhether the loss or range of loss w
as reasonably estimable.Our
 substantive audit procedures, among others, included gaining an understanding of the status of ongoing lawsuits, reviewingletters
 addressing  the  matters  from  internal  and  external  legal  counsel,  meetings  with  internal  legal  counsel  to  discuss  theallegations,
 and  obtaining  a  representation  letter  from  management  on  these  matters.  We  also  evaluated  the  Company’sdisclosures in relation to these matters.

Report of Independent Re
gistered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
Oracle CorporationOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We
 have audited Oracle Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control— IntegratedFramework
 issued  by  the  Committee  of Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013  framework)  (the  COSO  criteria).  In  our  opinion,  OracleCorporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects,
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.We
 also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balancesheets of Oracle Corporation as of
 May 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows foreach
 of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2020, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2 and ourreport June 22, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The
 Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  ofinternal control over financial reporting
 included in the accompanying Management’s report on Internal Control Over Financial reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
 financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare
 required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
 conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonableassurance about whether effective internal control over financial report
ing was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  andevaluating
 the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considerednecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
 basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial rep
orting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe
 transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permitpreparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are beingmade only in accordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timelydetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Oracle
 Corporation  provides  products  and  services  that  substantially  address  all  aspects  of  enterprise  information  technology  (IT)  environments,  includingapplications
 and  infrastructure.  We  deliver  our  products  and  services  to  customers  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and  interoperable  IT  deploymentmodels,
 including cloud-based, Cloud at Customer (an instance of Oracle Cloud in the customer’s own data center), on premise and hybrid models. Oracle CloudSoftware
-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (SaaS and IaaS, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide a comprehensive andintegrated
 stack of applications and infrastructure services delivered via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle deploys, hosts,  upgrades,  supports andmanages for
 the customer. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-basedor
 on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software products may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customerswith
 rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers thatpurchase
 our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include productrepairs,
 maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customerutilization of their investments in Or
acle applications and infrastructure technologies.Oracle
 Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun inJune 1977.
Basis of Financial Statements
The
 consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positionsof
 certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle’s stockholders for allperiods
 presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore havenot
 been  presented  separately  and  instead  are  included  as  a  component  of  non-operating  income,  net  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations.Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
In
 fiscal 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases  (Topic 842) and  subsequent amendments to the initial guidance: ASU 2017-13,ASU
 2018-10, ASU 2018-11, ASU 2018-20 and ASU 2019-01 (collectively, Topic 842). Topic 842 requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet,operating
 and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use (rOU) assets. We adopted this new standard using the effective date of June 1, 2019 asour
 initial application date. Consequently, financial information for the comparative periods was not updated. We elected the package of practical expedientspermitted
 under the transition guidance of the new standard, which allows us to carry forward our historical lease classification. The adoption of Topic 842 didnot
 result  in  a  cumulative  catch-up  adjustment  to  the  opening  of  our  accumulated  deficit  balance  as  of  June  1,  2019.  There  was  no  material  impact  to  ourconsolidated
 statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended May 31, 2020 due to the adoption of Topic 842. refer tothe “Leases” section below for a description of
 our accounting policy that we have applied since our adoption of Topic 842.Use of Estimates
Our
 consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  set  forth  in  the  FinancialAccounting
 Standards  Board’s  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the  various  staff  accounting  bulletins  and  other  applicableguidance
 issued  by  the  SEC.  These  accounting  principles  require  us  to  make  certain  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions.  We  believe  that  the  estimates,judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon
74

Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements
ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
—(Continued) May 31,
 2020  
information
 available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect thereported amounts of asset
s and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periodspresented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial
 statementswill
 be  affected.  In  many  cases,  the  accounting  treatment  of  a  particular  transaction  is  specifically  dictated  by  GAAP  and  does  not  require  management’sjudgment
 in its  application. There  are also areas in which  management’s  judgment  in selecting  among  available alternatives would not  produce  a materiallydifferent result.
Revenue Recognition
Our sources of revenues include:
 
•cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, which typicallyrepresent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments;
 
•hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products, including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and
 
•services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting, advanced customer servicesand education services.
License support revenues are
 typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by ourcustomers at their
 option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patchesreleased
 during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical supportpersonnel. License
 support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customerselect to renew their license support contracts annually.
Cloud
 services  revenues  include  revenues  from  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings,  which  deliver  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  via  cloud-baseddeployment
 models  that  we  develop  functionality  for,  provide  unspecified  updates  and  enhancements  for,  host,  manage,  upgrade  and  support  and  thatcustomers access by enterin
g into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which aredesigned
 to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for customer cloud-based, on-premise or other ITinfrastructure for a fee for a stated term.
Cloud
 license  and  on-premise  license  revenues  primarily  represent  amounts  earned  from  granting  customers  perpetual  licenses  to  use  our  database,middleware,
 application  and  industry-specific  software  products,  which  our  customers  use  for  cloud-based,  on-premise  and  other  IT  environments.  The  vastmajority of our cloud license and on-premise l
icense arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option.revenues
 from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage,and
 industry-specific  hardware.  Our  hardware  support  offerings  generally  provide  customers  with  software  updates  for  the  software  components  that  areessential
 to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardw
are products fees.Our services are offered
 to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consultingservices
 are designed  to help  our customers  to, among others,  deploy,  architect,  integrate,  upgrade  and  secure  their investments  in  Oracle applications andinfrastructure

technologies.
 Our  advanced customer services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products andservices.
 We  offer  these  advanced  customer  services  to  Oracle  customers  to  enable  increased  performance  and  higher  availability  of Oracle  products  andservices. Education services include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our cloud, software
 and hardware products.We
 apply the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue  From Contracts with Customers (ASC  606) as a single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of ourcloud, license,
 hardware and services arrangements and generally requires revenues to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or servicesprovided
 to  our  customers,  reflecting  the  amount  of  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  for  those  goods  or  services.  Pursuant  to  ASC  606, revenues  arerecognized upon the application of the following steps:
 
•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 
 
•identification of the performance obligations in the contract; 
 
•determination of the transaction price; 
 
•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 
 
•recognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied. 
Our
 customers that we contract with for the provision of cloud services, software, hardware or other services include businesses of many sizes, governmentagencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.
The
 timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accountsreceivable
 on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheetswhen
 revenues are recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices forcloud
 license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to thecustomer
 of the hardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud SaaS and IaaScontracts
 are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance. Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Mostcontracts
 that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financedthrough
 our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating income,net within our consolidated statements of operations based 
on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.  Our
 revenue  arrangements  generally  include  standard  warranty  or  service  level  provisions  that  our  arrangements  will  perform  and  operate  in  all  materialrespects
 as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant. Ourarrangements
 generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collectedfrom customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services
revenues
 from  cloud  services  provided  on  a  subscription  basis  are  generally  recognized  ratably  over  the  contractual  period  that  the  services  are  delivered,beginning
 on the date our service is made available to our customers. We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefitsof
 the cloud services throughout the contract period. revenues from cloud services that are provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, aregenerally recognized based on the utilization of
 the services by the customer.76

Revenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support
Oracle’s
 primary  performance  obligations with  respect  to  license  support  contracts  and  hardware  support  contracts  are  to provide  customers with technicalsupport
 as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period, if and when  they areavailable.
 Oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support services available continuously throughout the contract period. Therefore, revenues for license support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably over
 the contractual periods that the support services are provided.  Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and On-Pr
emise Licenserevenues
 from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software ismade
 available to the customer to download and use. revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses arerecognized
 at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. For usage-based royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount, theminimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is
 made available to the royalty customer.Revenue Recognition for Hardware Products
The
 hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as acombined
 performance  obligation.  The  revenues  for  this  combined  performance  obligation  are  generally  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  that  the  hardwareproduct is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer.
Revenue Recognition for Services
Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the serv
ices are performed. revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applyinginput methods to estimate progress to completion. revenues for consumption-based services are generall
y recognized as the services are performed.Allocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple 
Performance ObligationsMany
 of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. Oracleproducts
 and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally notcombined.
 We  allocate  the  transaction  price  for  each  contract  to  each  performance  obligation  based  on  the  relative  standalone  selling  price  (SSP)  for  eachperformance obligation within each contract.
We
 use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses,we
 are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. Wetypicall
y establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licensesand on-premise
 licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts atthe
 time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customerto
 access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products aresold
 for  a  broad  range  of  amounts  (that  is,  the  selling  price  is  highly  variable)  and  a  representative  SSP  is  not  discernible  from  past  transactions  or  otherobservable
 evidence.  As  a  result,  the  SSP  for  a  cloud  license  and  an  on-premise  license  included  in  a  contract  with  multiple  performance  obligations  isdetermined by applying a residual approach whereby all other perform

. Remaining Performance Oblig
ations from Customer ContractsTrade
 receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidatedbalance sheets as of May 31, 2020 and 2019. The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, that were included
in
 the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was approximately $8.4 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. revenuesrecognized from performanc
e obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year endedMay 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.  
remaining
 performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have beenissued
 to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in futureperiods.
 The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. Ineach
 fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our firstfiscal
 quarter.  These  seasonal  impacts  influence  how  our  remaining  performance  obligations  change  over  time  and,  combined  with  foreign  exchange  ratefluctuations
 and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2020, our remainingperformance
 obligations were $37.0 billion, approximately 62% of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months and the remainderthereafter.
Sales of Financing Receivables
We
 offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term paymentcontracts.
 We  generally  sell  these  contracts  that  we  have  financed  for  our  customers  on  a  non-recourse  basis  to  financial  institutions  within  90  days  of  thecontracts’
 dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we areconsidered
 to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively,of our financing receivables were sold to financia
l institutions.Business Combinations
We
 apply  the  provisions  of  ASC  805, Business  Combinations (ASC  805),  in  accounting  for  our  acquisitions.  ASC  805  requires  that  we  evaluate  whether  atransacti
on pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capableof
 being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisitionto
 the  individual  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  on  a  relative  fair  value  basis;  whereas  the  acquisition  of  a  business  requires  us  to  recognize  separately  fromgoodwil
l the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excessof
 consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimatesand
 assumptions  to  accurately  value  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  at  the  business  acquisition  date  as  well  as  any  contingent  consideration,  whereapplicable, our estimates are inherently
 uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from thebusiness acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion ofa business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of
 the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any78

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
—(Continued) May 31,
 2020  
subsequent adjustments
 are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Costs  to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or ourinternal
 operations  are  accounted  for  as  termination  and  exit  costs  pursuant  to  ASC  420, Exit  or  Disposal  Cost  Obligations (ASC  420),  and  are  accounted  forseparately
 from  the  business  combination.  A  liability  for  costs  associated  with  an  exit  or  disposal  activity  is  recognized  and  measured  at  its  fair  value  in  ourconsolidated
 statement  of  operations  in  the  period  in  which  the  liability  is  incurred.  Prior  to  June  1,  2019,  we  accounted  for  operating  lease  abandonmentpursuant
 to  the  provisions  of  ASC  420.  Effective  June  1,  2019,  abandoned  operating  leases  related  to  an  acquired  company  or  our  internal  operations  areaccounted for as 
rOU asset impair ment charges pursuant to Topic 842 and are accounted for separately from the business combination. In all periods presented, when
 estimating the asset impairment charges, assumptions were applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ from actualresults. This may require us to revise our init
ial estimates which may affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. For
 a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation ofthese
 pre-acquisition  contingencies  throughout  the  measurement  period  in  order  to  obtain  sufficient  information  to  assess  whether  we  include  thesecontingencies
 as  a  part  of  the  fair  value  estimates  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed  and,  if  so,  to  determine  their  estimated  amounts.  If  we  cannotreasonably
 determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the casegiven
 the nature of such  matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency  if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or aliability
 had  been  incurred  at  the  business  acquisition  date  and  (2)  the  amount  of  the  asset  or  liability  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Subsequent  to  themeasurement
 period  or  final  determination  of  the  net  asset  values  for  the  business  combination,  changes  in  our  estimates  of  such  contingencies  will  affectearnings and could have a material effect on our results 
of operations and financial position.In
 addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. Wereevaluate
 these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminaryestimates
 being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the taxallowance’s or contingency’s estimated value,
 whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect ourprovision for income taxes in our conso
lidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities
In
 accordance with ASC 320, Investments—Debt  and Equity Securities,  and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify substantially all ofour
 marketable  debt  securities  as  available-for-sale.  We  carry  these  securities  at  fair  value,  and  report  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses,  net  of  taxes,  as  acomponent
 of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary, which we record within non-operating income, net inthe
 accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  We  periodically  evaluate  our  investments  to  determine  if  impairment  charges  are  required.Substantially
 all of our marketable debt investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in currentoperations.
Investments in
 equity securities, other than any equity method investments, are recorded at fair value, if fair value is readily determinable. We hold investmentsin
 certain non-marketable equity securities with no readily determinable fair values in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Wemeasure these
 equity securities at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investmentsof
 the same issuer. Our non-marketable equity securities are included  in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and aresubject to periodic impairment reviews.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments
We
 apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair  Value Measurement (ASC  820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant toother accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments.
The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are
 included in Note 4.Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
We
 record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed,provisions
 are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivablewas
 recorded in and current economic trends. We  write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collectionefforts without success.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instrum
ents that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivativesand
 trade receivables. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure toany
 single financial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities.Our
 derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related losses inthese
 contracts  is largely mitigated  with collateral security  agreements  that provide  for collateral to be received  or posted  when the net fair values of thesecontracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. We generally do not
 require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to tradereceivable
s is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customercontracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer 
accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.We
 outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside theU.S.
 Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations wherethese third-party
 manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for ourhardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business.
Inventories
Inventories
 are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-outbasis.
 We  evaluate  our  ending  inventories  for  estimated  excess  quantities  and  obsolescence.  This  evaluation  includes  analysis  of  sales  levels  by  product  andprojections
 of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and chargedto
 hardware expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete.At
 the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in therestoration
 or increase in that newly established cost basis. Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balancesheets and totaled $211 million and $320 million at May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Other Receivables
Other receivables represent value-added
 tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables areincluded
 in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $778 million and $776 million at May 31, 2020 and 2019,respectively.
Deferred Sales Commissions
We
 defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud, license support andhardware
 support contract. Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-linebasis
 over  a  period  of  benefit  that  we  estimate  to  be  four  to  five  years.  We  determine  the  period  of  benefit  by  taking  into  consideration  the  historical  andexpected
 durations of our customer contracts, the expected useful lives of our technologies, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts relatingto
 our  cloud-based  arrangements  are  generally  deferred  and  then  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  related  contractual  renewal  period,  which  isgenerally
 one  to  three  years.  Amortization  of  deferred  sales  commissions  is  included  as  a  component  of  sales  and  marketing  expenses  in  our  consolidatedstatements of operations.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
 plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
 method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from one to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of theestimated
 useful  lives  of  the  improvements  or  the  lease  terms,  as  appropriate.  Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  periodically  reviewed  for  impairmentwhenever
 events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  We  did  not  recognize  any  significantproperty impairment charges in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments
Goodwill
 represents the excess of the purchase  price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangibleassets
 that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period weevaluate the estimated remaining usef
ul lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remainingperiods of amortization.
The carrying amounts of
 our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibleassets)
 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When goodwill is assessed forimpairment,
 we  have  the  option  to  perform  an  assessment  of  qualitative  factors  of  impairment  (optional  assessment)  prior  to  necessitating  a  quantitativeimpairment
 test.  Should  the  optional  assessment  be  used  for  any  given  fiscal  year,  qualitative  factors  to  consider  for  a  reporting  unit  include:  cost  factors;financial
 performance;  legal,  regulatory,  contractual,  political,  business,  or  other  factors;  entity  specific  factors;  industry  and  market  considerations;macroecono
mic conditions; and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likelythan not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying valu
e, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. Forthose
 reporting units tested using a quantitative  approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting  unit with the carrying amount of the reporting  unit,including goodwill.
 To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows thereporting
 unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis; the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis; future economic and marketconditions;
 and market comparables of peer companies, among others. If, as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less thanthe carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to
 the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting81

unit. 
Our  most recent goodwill impairment analysis was performed on March 1, 2020  and did not result in a goodwill impairment charge.  We did not recognize impairment charge
s  in fiscal 2019  or 2018 .recoverability
 of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset isexpected
 to generate. recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If theasset
 is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impairedasset.
 We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018. At least annually, we assess the useful lives of our finite livedintangible
 assets  and  may  adjust  the  period  over  which  these  assets  are  amortized  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  a  shorteramortization period is more
 reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows.Derivative Financial Instruments
During
 fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 10 below for additionalinformation). We do not use derivative f
inancial instruments for trading purposes. We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging 
(ASC 815), which  requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as ofeach
 reporting  date.  ASC  815  also  requires  that  changes  in  our  derivatives’  fair  values  be  recognized  in  earnings,  unless  specific  hedge  accounting  anddocumentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges).
The
 accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  a  derivative  depends  on  the  intended  use  of  the  derivative  and  the  resulting  designation.  For  a  derivativeinstrument
 designated  as  a  fair  value  hedge,  loss  or  gain  attributable  to  the  risk  being  hedged  is  recognized  in  earnings  in  the  period  of  change  with  acorresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged.
For
 a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, each reporting period we record the change in fair value of the derivative to accumulated othercomprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated balance sheets, and the change is reclassif
ied to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings.Leases
As
 referenced above, our accounting policy for leases under ASC 842 was prospectively effective for us as of June 1, 2019. We determine if an arrangement is alease
 at its inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the leaseterm. We generally use
 our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value offuture payments, because the implicit ra
te of the lease is generally not known. right of Use (rOU) assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured atlease
 inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives. Our lease terms that areused
 in determining our operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that wewill
 exercise such options. We amortize our rOU assets as operating lease expense generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term and classify both thelease
 amortization  and  imputed  interest  as  operating  expenses.  We  have  lease  agreements  with  lease  and  non-lease  components,  and  in  such  cases,  wegenerally account for the components as a
 single lease component. We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any lease with an original lease termof less than one year.
rOU
 assets related to our operating leases are included in other non-current assets, short-term operating lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities,and
 long-term operating lease liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash flow movements related to ourlease
 activities  are  included  in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  assets  and  accounts  payable  and  other  liabilities  as  presented  in  net  cash  provided  by  operatingactivities in our consolidated statement of cash f
lows for the year ended May 31, 2020.82

Legal and Other Contingencies
We
 are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financialexposure.
 Descriptions  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  contingencies  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  are  provided  under  “BusinessCombinations”
 above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for anestimated
 loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 17 belowprovides additional information regarding certain of 
our legal contingencies.Shipping and Handling Costs
Our shipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware expenses for al
l periods presented.Foreign Currency
We
 transact  business  in  various  foreign  currencies.  In  general,  the  functional  currency  of  a  foreign  operation  is  the  local  country’s  currency.  Consequently,revenues
 and  expenses  of  operations  outside  the  U.S.  are  translated  into  U.S.  Dollars  using  weighted-average  exchange  rates  while  assets  and  liabilities  ofoperations
 outside  the  U.S.  are  translated  into  U.S.  Dollars  using  exchange  rates  at  the  balance  sheet  dates.  The  effects  of  foreign  currency  translationadjustments are
 included in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCL in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements aresummarized
 as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income,net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $185 mill
ion, $111 million and $74 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Stock-Based Compensation
We
 account for share-based payments to employees, including  grants of service-based restricted  stock unit awards, performance-based  restricted stock unitawards
 (PSUs),  service-based  employee  stock  options,  performance-based  stock  options  (PSOs),  and  purchases  under  employee  stock  purchase  plans  inaccordance with
 ASC 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation, which  requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognizedin our consolidated statements of operations based on their
 fair values. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.For
 our  service-based  stock  awards,  we  recognize  stock-based  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  service  period  of  the  award,  which  isgenerally four years.
For
 our PSUs and PSOs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the longer of the derived, explicit or implicit service period(which is the
 period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied). During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock-based compensationexpense
 is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets thatresult
 in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest, or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods, may cause the amount of stock-based
 compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number ofshares
 that  are  expected  to  vest  are  reflected  in  the  amount  of  stock-based  compensation  expense  that  we  recognize  for  each  PSU  or  PSO  tranche  on  acumulative
 catch  up  basis  during  each  interim  reporting  period  in  which  such  estimates  are  altered.  Changes  in  estimates  of  the  implicit  service  periods  arerecognized prospectively.
We
 record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount ofstock-based compens
ation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection witha business combination

at
 the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awardsthat
 are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercisedwith
 any  shortfall/windfall  relative  to  the  deferred  tax  asset  established  recorded  as  a  discrete  detriment/benefit  to  our  provision  for  income  taxes  in  suchperiod.

Income Taxes
We
 account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income  Taxes (ASC  740). Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences oftemporary
 differences  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  amounts  recognized  for  income  tax  purposes.  Werecord a valuation allow
ance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.A two-step approach is appli
ed pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.The
 first  step  is  to  determine  if  the  weight  of  available  evidence  indicates  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  tax  position  will  be  sustained  in  an  audit,including
 resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%likely to be
 realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of ourconsolidated statements of operations.
A
 description  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  tax  related  contingencies  and  valuation  allowances  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  isprovided under “Business Combinations” above.

consolidated
 financial statements. The total purchase price for Aconex was approximately $1.2  billion, which consisted of approximately $1.2  billion in cash and$
7 million for the fair values of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, werecorded
 approximately $873  million of goodwill, $377  million of identifiable intangible assets, and  $29 million of net liabilities. Goodwill  generated from ouracquisition of Aconex was primarily
 attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is tax deductible.Other Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 Acquisitions
During
 fiscal 2020,  2019 and 2018, we  acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand ourproducts and services offerings
. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate to our consol idated financial statements.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES Cash
 and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, money market funds and other securitieswith
 original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain othersecurities.
The
 amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2020 and 2019. We use thespecific
 identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realizedgains

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS We
 perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid totransfer
 a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assetsand
 liabilities required  to be recorded  at their fair values, we consider  the  principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and  considerassumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or l
iabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.ASC
 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs whenmeasuring
 fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fairvalue measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to me
asure fair value: 
•Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
•Level  2:  inputs  other  than  Level  1  that  are  observable,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  such  as  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  similar  assets  orliabilities,
 quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar  assets  or  liabilities  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  or  other  inputs  that  are  observable  or  can  becorroborated by observable market data for substantia
lly the full term of the assets or liabilities; or 
•Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a
 Recurring BasisOur assets and liabilities measured at
 fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):

We  entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effects of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with the 2.25% senior notes that were due and were settledin
 October 2019 (October 2019 Notes) and the 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOr. The effectiveinterest
 rates after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements were 3.07% as of May 31, 2019 for the October 2019 Notes, and 1.99% and 3.22%, respectively, for the July2021 Notes as of

Deferred cloud
 services and license support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for cloud orsupport
 contracts  that are  typically billed in advance  with corresponding  revenues  generally being  recognized  ratably over  the  contractual periods. Deferredservices
 revenues  include  prepayments  for  our  services  business  and  revenues  for  these  services  are  generally  recognized  as  the  services  are  performed.Deferred cloud license and on-premise license revenues typically resulted from customer payments that
 related to undelivered products and services or specifiedenhancements.
In
 connection  with  our  acquisitions,  we  have  estimated  the  fair  values  of  the  cloud  services  and  license  support  performance  obligations  assumed  from  ouracquired
 companies.  We  generally  have  estimated  the  fair  values  of  these  obligations  assumed  using  a  cost  build-up  approach.  The  cost  build-up  approachdetermines
 fair  value  by  estimating  the  costs  related  to  fulfilling  the  obligations  plus  a  normal  profit  margin.  The  sum  of  the  costs  and  operating  profitapproximates,
 in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations. These aforementioned fair valueadjustments
 recorded  for  obligations  assumed  from  our  acquisitions  reduced  the  cloud  services  and  license  support  deferred  revenues  balances  that  werecorded
 as  liabilities  from  these  acquisitions  and  also  reduced  the  resulting  revenues  that  we  recognized  or  will  recognize  over  the  terms  of  the  acquiredobligations during the post-combination periods.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges
— Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap AgreementsIn
 May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July2025
 Notes  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Euro  denominated  2025  Notes,  including  the  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  of  principal  atmaturity,
 to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOr. In July 2014,  we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have theeconomic
 effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectivelybecame
 variable based on LIBOr. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes that the swapagreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates.
We
 have designated the aforementioned swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC815.
 The changes in fair values of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2025 Notes are recognized as interest expense andnon-operating income, net
 in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in non-current assets or non-current liabilitiesin our consolidated balance sheets.

The
 changes  in  fair  values  of  our  interest  rate  swap  agreements  associated  with  our  July  2021  Notes  are  recognized  as interest  expense  in  our  consolidatedstatements
 of  operations  with  the  corresponding  amounts  included  in  other  non-current  assets  or  other  non-current  liabilities  in  our  consolidated  balancesheets.
 The  amount  of  net  gain  (loss)  attributable  to  the  interest  rate  risk  being  hedged  is  recognized  as  interest  expense  and  amount  of  net  gain  (loss)attributable
 to the foreign exchange risk being hedged, as applicable, is recognized as non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operationswith
 the corresponding amount included in notes payable, current or notes payable, non-current. We exclude the portion of the change in fair value of cross-currency interest rate swap
 agreements attributable to the related cross-currency basis spread in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The change in fair valueof
 these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the cross-currency basis spread is included in AOCL. The periodic interest settlements forthe
 swap agreements for the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operatingactivities
 and,  for  the  swap  agreements  associated  with  the  July  2025  Notes,  the  cash  flows  that  pertain  to  the  principal  balance  are  classified  as  financingactivities.
Cash Flow Hedges
— Cross-Currency Swap AgreementsIn
 connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currencyexchange
 risk  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Euro-denominated  January  2021  Notes,  including  the  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  ofprincipal
 at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cashflows
 in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interestrate
 of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedgespursuant
 to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest paymentsbeing hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes.
We
 used the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swapagreements
 are recognized as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect the gains or losses on the effectiveportion
 of  these  cross-currency  swap  agreements  in  AOCL  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  an  amount  is  reclassified  out  of  AOCL  into  non-operatingincome,
 net in the same period that the carrying values of the Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes are remeasured and the interest expense is recognized.The
 cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cashflows that pertain to the principal balance are
 classified as financing activities.Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as 
HedgesWe
 transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risksassociated
 with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or
 decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolati
lity associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany
 sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Ourforeign
 currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generallydepend
 on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in thoserates, the net realized and unrealized gains or l
osses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.95

We do not
 designate  these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of theend
 of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. The balancesheet
 classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other currentliabilities
 for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income, net
 for both realized and unrealized gains and l osses.As
 of  May  31,  2020  and  2019,  the  notional  amounts  of  the  forward  contracts  we  held  to  purchase  U.S.  Dollars  in  exchange  for  other  major  internationalcurrencies were
 $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other majorinternational
 currencies were $3.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal atMay 31, 2020 and 2019. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activit

LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES Leases
We
 have operating leases that primarily relate to certain of our facilities, data centers and vehicles. As of May 31, 2020, our operating leases substantially haveremaining terms of one year to twe
lve years, some of which include options to extend and/or terminate the leases.For
 fiscal 2020, operating lease expenses totaled $599 million, net of sublease income of $16 million. At May 31, 2020, rOU assets, current lease liabilities andnon-current
 lease  liabilities  for  our  operating  leases  were  $2.0  billion,  $575  million  and  $1.5  billion,  respectively.  We  recorded  rOU  assets  of  $2.8  billion  inexchange for
 operating lease obligations during the year ended May 31, 2020, which included $1.9 billion for operating leases existing on June 1, 2019 that wererecognized
 upon our initial adoption of Topic 842 and $849 million for operating leases that were contracted during fiscal 2020. Cash paid for amounts includedin
 the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $663 million for year ended May 31, 2020. As of May 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease termfor operating leases was approximatel
y six years and the weighted average discount rate used for calculating operating lease obligations was 3.2%. As of May 31,2020,
 we have $411 million of additional operating lease commitments, primarily for data centers, that commence in fiscal 2021 for terms of one to ten yearsthat are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as

Guarantees
Our
 cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe athird
 party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any materialliabilities related to such obligat
ions in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions98

indemnifying
 customers  against  liabilities  in  the  event  we  breach  confidentiality  or  service  level  requirements.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximumpotential
 amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts andcircumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Our Oracle
 Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreementduring the service period.
 Our license and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in theapplicable program documentation for a period of one 
year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent withindustry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of
 the services.We
 occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business including, amongothers,
 guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had amaterial effect on our results of operat
ions, financial position or cash flows.    In
 connection with certain litigation, we posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with a court and entered into related indemnification agreements witheach of the surety bond issuing companies. Additional information is prov
ided in Note 17 below.12.
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Common Stock Repurchases
Our
 Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019 and March 12, 2020, we announcedthat
 our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $30.0 billion. As  of May 31, 2020, approximately  $16.6billion
 remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 361.0 million shares for $19.2 billion, 733.8 millionshares for $36.0 billion, and 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion in fisca
l 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, under the stock repurchase program.Our
 stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capitalneeds, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and
 economicand
 market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stockrepurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Dividends on Common Stock
During
 fiscal  2020,  2019  and  2018,  our  Board  of  Directors  declared  cash  dividends  of  $0.96,  $0.81  and  $0.76  per  share  of  our  outstanding  common  stock,respectively, which we paid during the same period.
In
 June 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 28,2020 to
 stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 15, 2020. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and paymentdates are subject to the final determination of our Bo

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Stock-Based Compensation Plans
Stock Plans
In
 fiscal 2001, we adopted the 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, which provides for the issuance of long-term performance awards, including restrictedstock-based
 awards,  non-qualified  stock  options  and  incentive  stock  options,  as  well  as  stock  purchase  rights  and  stock  appreciation  rights,  to  our  eligibleemployees, officers and directors who are als
o employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers. 
•In  fiscal  2011,  our  stockholders,  upon  the  recommendation  of  our  Board  of  Directors  (the  Board),  approved  the  adoption  of  the  Amended  andrestated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan
 by 10 years and increased thenumber of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015 shares.
 
•In  fiscal 2014, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stockthat
 may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in theform
 of restricted stock units (rSUs) and performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs). For each share granted as a full value award under the2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares ava
ilable for grant. 
•In  fiscal 2018, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stockthat
 may  be  issued  under  the  2000  Plan  by  330,000,000  shares,  and  approved  material  terms  of  the  performance  goals  under  which  PSUs  andperformance-based stock options (PSOs) could be granted.
As of
 May 31, 2020, the 2000 Plan had 97 million unvested rSUs outstanding, 54 million PSOs outstanding and service-based stock options (SOs) to purchase 120million
 shares of common stock outstanding of which 112 million shares were vested. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 212 million shares of common stockwere
 available for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan.The 2000 Plan is scheduled to expire on the date of Oracle’s annual meeting of st
ockholders in November 2020.The vesting schedule for all awards granted under the 2000 Plan is
 established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. rSUs generally requireservice-ba
sed vesting of 25% annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs currently requires achieving performance targets and providing service overfour fiscal years. SOs are granted at
 not less than fair market value, become exercisable generally 25% annually over four years of service, and generally expire 10years
 from the date of grant. PSOs granted to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consist of seven numerically equivalentvesting tranches that potentially may

vest. 
One  tranche vests solely on the attainment of a market-based metric. The remaining six  tranches require the attainment of both a performance metric anda
 market capitalization metric. In each case, the market-based metric, performance metrics and market capitalization metrics for  the PSOs may  be achieved atany
 time during a five year  performance  period, assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board ofDirectors
 certifies that performance has been achieved. The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years  in  comparison to the typical ten year  contractual  lives forSOs.
 For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is to be recognized once each vestingtranche becomes probab
le of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service. Stock-based compensation associated with a
 vesting tranche where vesting is no longer determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the periodwhen 
such  a determination is made. We  have preliminarily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement to beup
 to five  years.  Stock-based  compensation  for  the  market-based  tranche  will  be  recognized  using  the  derived  service  period  for  the  market-based  metricachievement, which we have initially estimated t
o be approximately three years . In
 fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of rSUs and other stock-based awards,including
 non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of theDirectors’
 Plan,  10  million  shares  of  common  stock  are  reserved  for  issuance (including  a  fiscal  2013  amendment  to  increase  the  number  of  shares  of  ourcommon stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares).
 In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, andexpire no more than 10
 years from the date of grant. We currently grant rSUs only that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors’Plan
 was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automaticgrants
 of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants forchairing
 certain  Board  committees,  subject  to  certain  stockholder  approved  limitations  set  forth  in  the  Directors’  Plan.  In  April  2020,  the  CompensationCommittee reduced the maximum
 value of the annual automatic rSU grants to each non-employee director from $400,000 to $350,000 and eliminated all equitygrants
 for chairing board committees. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 81,000 unvested rSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1 million shares ofcommon
 stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 1 million shares were available forfuture stock awards under this plan.
In
 connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’srespective
 stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the 2000 Plan. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed orsubstituted
 generally retain all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2020, stockoptions to purchase approximately 1 mill
ion shares of common stock were outstanding under acquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.101

 aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $2.9 billion, $3.1 billionand
 $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options thatwere exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were
 $638 million, $692 million and $860 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fairmarket
 value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2020, 44 million shares were reserved for future issuances under thePurchase Plan. We issued 2 million shares in each of f
iscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 3 million shares in fiscal 2018 under the Purchase Plan.Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement
 PlansWe
 offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $376 million, $380 million and$384 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In
 the  U.S.,  regular  employees  can  participate  in  the  Oracle  Corporation  401(k)  Savings  and  Investment  Plan  (Oracle  401(k)  Plan).  Participants  can  generallycontribute
 up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit asdefined
 by the U.S. Internal revenue Service (IrS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period,subject
 to maximum aggregate matching  amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k)  Plan, net  of forfeitures, were $152  million, $154  million and  $151million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We
 also  offer  non-qualified  deferred  compensation  plans  to  certain  employees  whereby  they  may  defer  a  portion  of  their  annual  base  and/or  variablecompensation
 until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were eachapproximately $636 million and approximate
ly $566 million as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and othernon-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We
 sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed throughour
 acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or intogovernment-managed
 accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $97 million,$90 million and $102 million for fiscal 2020, 2019
 and 2018, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) ofour
 defined  benefit  plans  as  of  May  31,  2020  were  $1.3  billion  and  $884  million,  respectively,  and  as  of  May  31,  2019  were  $1.2  billion  and  $821  million,respectively.

INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rates for each of the peri
ods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of incometax
 rates. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings inforeign
 operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, theForeign
 Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). During fiscal 2019, we recorded a net benefit of$389 million in
 accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) related to adjustments in our estimates of the one-time transition tax on certainforeign subsidiary earnings,
 and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities affected by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act).Our
 provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to earnings in foreign operations,state
 taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign DerivedIntangible
 Income deduction, GILTI, and the aforementioned $389 million net reduction to our transition tax recorded consistent with the provision of SAB 118.Our
 provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Act uponour
 adoption date of January 1, 2018 including the impacts of the transition tax, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with taxauthorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activ
ity deduction.The following is a geographical breakdown

We
 provide for taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We do not provide for taxes on other outside basis temporary differences of foreignsubsidiaries
 as they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At May 31, 2020, the amount of temporary differences related to other outside basistemporary
 differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $7.9 billion. If the otheroutside
 basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associatedwith
 the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2020, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferredtax liability ass
ociated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $1.5 billion.Our
 net deferred tax assets were $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the netdeferred
 tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxableincome
 in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and taxcredit carryforwa
rds. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable incomechange.

The
 valuation allowance was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2020and 2019 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allow

 May  31,  2020,  we  had  federal  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  of  approximately  $597  million,  which  are  subject  to  limitation  on  their  utilization.Approximately
 $537 million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038. Approximately $60 million of thesefederal net
 operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.0 billion at May 31,2020, which
 expire between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards ofapproximately
 $1.9 billion at May 31, 2020, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.7 billion of these foreign net operating lossesare not currently subje

 We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion at May 31, 2020, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $741million of

 We  recognized  interest  and  penalties  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  line  of  our  consolidated  statements  ofoperations
 of $202 million, $312 million and $127 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2020 and2019 were $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.
Domestically,
 U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal2017.
 Many  issues  are  at  an  advanced  stage  in  the  examination  process,  the  most  significant  of  which  include  the  deductibility  of  certain  royalty payments,transfer
 pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and development credits taken. With all ofthese domestic audit
 issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2020, the gross unrecognized tax benefitsrelated to these
 audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $1.1 billion ($1.0 billion netof
 offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and we are no longer subject to audit forthose periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with

some exceptions, have been examined for all ye
ars prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.Internationally,
 tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that it wasreasonably
 possible that, as of May 31, 2020, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by asmuch
 as  $105  million  ($42  million  net  of  offsetting  tax  benefits)  in  the  next  12  months  related  primarily  to  transfer  pricing.  With  some  exceptions,  we  aregenerally no longer subject to tax examinati
ons in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001.We
 believe  that  we  have  adequately  provided  under  GAAP  for  outcomes  related  to  our  tax  audits.  However,  there  can  be  no  assurances  as  to  the  possibleoutcomes
 or any related financial statement effect thereof. On June 22, 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court declined a Writ of Certiorari in the case of Altera Corp vsCommissioner
 challenging a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (which itself reversed a previous decision of the U.S. Tax Court) holding that the U.S.Treasury
 Department’s  regulations  requiring  the  inclusion  of  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  a  taxpayer’s  cost-sharing  calculations  were  valid.  Ourconsolidated
 financial  statements  have  been  prepared  consistent  with  this  outcome,  and  accordingly  no  adjustments  will  be  required  as  the  result  of  thisdevelopment.
We
 are under audit by the IrS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved invarious
 challenges  and  litigation  in  a  number  of  countries,  including,  in  particular,  Australia,  Brazil,  Canada,  India,  Indonesia,  Israel,  South  Korea,  Mexico,Pakistan,
 Saudi  Arabia  and  Spain,  where  the  amounts  under  controversy  are  significant.  In  some,  although  not  all  cases,  we  have  reserved  for  potentialadjustments
 to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these taxauthorities
 or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will nothave
 a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities wouldresult
 in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign incometax liabilities and indirect ta
x liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.109

SEGMENT INFORMATION ASC
 280, Segment Reporting ,  establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of anenterprise
 about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, indeciding
 how  to  allocate  resources  and  in  assessing  performance.  Our  chief  operating  decision  makers  (CODMs)  are  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  ChiefTechnology
 Officer.  We  are  organized  by  line  of  business  and  geographically.  While  our  CODMs  evaluate  results  in  a  number  of  different  ways,  the  line  ofbusiness
 management  structure  is  the  primary  basis  for  which  the  allocation  of  resources  and  financial  results  are  assessed.  The  tabular  information  belowpresents
 the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company’s performance and allocatingcompany resources.
We
 have three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a single  operating  segment. All three of our businessesmarket
 and  sell  our  offerings  globally  to  businesses  of  many  sizes,  government  agencies,  educational  institutions  and  resellers  with  a  worldwide  sales  forcepositioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.
Our
 cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premisedeployment models
 including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud services and licensesupport revenues
 are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers overtime
 with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms, and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms. Cloud servicesand
 license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become availableand
 for  which  the  customer  contracted  and  also  include  related  technical  support  services  over  the  contractual  term.  Cloud  license  and  on-premise  licenserevenues
 represent  fees  earned  from  granting  customers  licenses,  generally  on  a  perpetual  basis,  to  use  our  database  and  middleware  and  our  applicationssoftware
 products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to thecustomer
 to  download  and  use,  which  typically  is  immediate  upon  signature  of  the  license  contract.  In  each  fiscal  year,  our  cloud  and  license  business’contractual activities are typically highest in our
 fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscalquarter of the next fiscal year) as
 we receive payments from these contracts.Our
 hardware business  provides Oracle Engineered  Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific  hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management  andother
 hardware-related  software  to  support  diverse  IT  environments.  Our  hardware  business  also  offers  hardware  support,  which  provides  customers  withsoftware
 updates  for  the  software  components  that  are  essential  to  the  functionality  of  their  hardware  products,  such  as  Oracle  Solaris  and  certain  othersoftware, and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.
Our
 services  business  provides  services  to  customers  and  partners  to  help  maximize  the  performance  of  their  investments  in  Oracle  applications  andinfrastructure technologies.
We do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not
 practical to show assets by operating segment.110

We have
 considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating financial performance, and disclosures presented outside of our financialstatements
 in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty ofrevenues
 and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services aspresented in our 
consolidated statements of operations, the total of which is reconciled to revenues from our reportable segments as per the preceding tables ofthis footnote.
The
 following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region. The relative proportion of our total revenues between each geographic region aspresented in the table below was material
ly consistent across each of our operating segments’ revenues for each of fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018:

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation
On
 June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of SantaClara
 against  Oracle  Corporation  alleging  numerous  causes  of  action  including  breach  of  contract,  breach  of  the  covenant  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing,defamation,
 intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint allegedthat
 when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP’s Itanium-based servers, itbreached
 a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 (the HP Settlement Agreement), resolving litigation between HP and one of Oracle’s formerCEOs
 who had previously acted as HP’s chief executive officer and chairman of HP’s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights andobligations under the HP Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief. 
Oracle answered the complaint and filed cross-claims.After
 a bench trial on the meaning of the HP Settlement Agreement, the court found that the HP Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to developcertain of its soft
ware products for use on HP’s Itanium-based servers at no cost to HP. The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016. On June 30, 2016, the juryreturned
 a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on itscross-claims.
 The jury awarded HP $3.0 billion in damages. Under the court’s rulings, HP is entitled to post-judgment interest, but not pre-judgment interest, onthis award.
After the trial court denied Or
acle’s motion for a new trial, Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal ofthe trial court’s denial of pre-judgment interest.
Oracle
 has posted a mandated surety bond with the trial court for the amounts owing. No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations. Wecontinue
 to  believe  that  we  have  meritorious  defenses  against  HP’s  claims,  and  we  intend  to  present  these  defenses  to  the  appellate  court.  Oracle  filed  itsopening
 brief on March 7, 2019. Briefing on the appeal was completed November 1, 2019, and the appellate court has not scheduled a date for oral argument.We
 cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and thenature
 of  the  claims.  Litigation  is  inherently  unpredictable,  and  the  outcome  of  the  appeal  process  related  to  this  action  is  uncertain.  It  is  possible  that  theresolution of this action could have a m
aterial impact on our future cash flows and results of operations.Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracl
e’s NetSuite AcquisitionOn
 May  3  and  July  18,  2017,  two  alleged  stockholders  filed  separate  derivative  lawsuits  in  the  Court  of  Chancery  of  the  State  of  Delaware,  purportedly  onOracle’s
 behalf.  Thereafter,  the  court  consolidated  the  two  derivative  cases  and  designated  the  July  18,  2017  complaint  as  the  operative  complaint.  Theconsolidated
 lawsuit was brought against all the then-current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant.Plaintif
f alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. Plaintiffseeks
 declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which thecourt denied on March 19, 2018.
On
 May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative action. Three non-employee
 directors served on the SLC. On August 15, 2019, the SLC filed a letter with the court, stating that the SLC believed that plaintiff should be allowed toproceed
 with the derivative litigation on behalf of Oracle. After the SLC advised the Board that it had fulfilled its duties and obligations, the Board withdrew theSLC’s authority, except that the SLC maintained certain authority to
 respond to discovery requests in the litigation.114

 2020  
After
 plaintiff filed its initial complaint, plaintiff filed  several amended complaints. Plaintiff  filed its most recent amended complaint on February 18, 2020. Thecomplaint asserts
 claims for breach of fiduciary duty against our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, the estate of Mark Hurd (our former ChiefExecutive
 Officer  who  passed  away  on  October  18,  2019),  and  two  other  members  of  our  Board  of  Directors.  Oracle  is  named  as  a  nominal  defendant.  Thecomplaint
 also asserts an aiding-and-abetting claim against NetSuite’s former Chief Executive Officer and NetSuite’s former  Chief Technology Officer. The  twoformer
 NetSuite officers moved to dismiss the complaint, and the court held a hearing on that motion on March 11, 2020. The court has not yet ruled on thatmotion.
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer answered the latest complaint on March 3, 2020, and Oracle filed an answer on the same day.On February 20, 2020, the other defenda
nts filed a motion to dismiss. No hearing has been scheduled for this motion. On
 April 20, 2020, after our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer indicated that they might challenge plaintiff’s standing to pursue this matter, anadditiona
l plaintiff moved to intervene in this case. On April 29, 2020, the court granted that plaintiff’s motion to intervene. On May 7, 2020, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer and Chief
 Technology Officer filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking to have the plaintiff that filed the July 18, 2017 complaint dismissed from thecase
 for lack of standing, arguing that this plaintiff had not continuously owned Oracle stock during the relevant time period. This motion is scheduled for oralargument on July 9, 2020.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, 
we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Securities Class Action and Derivative Litigation Concernin
g Oracle’s Cloud BusinessOn
 August 10, 2018, a putative class action, brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Californiaagainst
 us, our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, two other Oracle executives, and one former Oracle executive. As noted above,Mr.
 Hurd,  one of our then-two  Chief Executive  Officers,  passed  away on October  18, 2019.  On March  8, 2019,  plaintiff  filed an amended  complaint.  Plaintiffalleges
 that  the  defendants  made  or  are  responsible  for  false  and  misleading  statements  regarding  Oracle’s  cloud  business.  Plaintiff  further  alleges  that  theformer
 Oracle executive engaged in insider trading. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a class action, and seeks damages, attorneys’ fees andcosts,
 and unspecified declaratory/injunctive relief. On April 19, 2019,  defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint. On December 17, 2019, thecourt granted this motion, giving
 plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint, which plaintiff filed on February 17, 2020. On April 23, 2020, defendantsfiled
 a motion to dismiss, which is scheduled for hearing on September 24, 2020. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we willcontinue to vigorously defend it.
On
 February 12, 2019, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative suit is brought bytwo
 alleged stockholders of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against all members of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiffsclaim
 that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, and that Oracle’s Board members violatedtheir
 fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, reasonable inquiry, and good faith by failing to prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants’ actionsconstitute
 gross mismanagement, waste, and securities fraud. Plaintiffs seek a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendantsare
 liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, an order directing defendants to enact corporate reforms, attorneys’ fees and costs, and unspecified equitablerelief.
 On April 26, 2019, the court approved a stay of this action, which will be lifted if the class action discussed above is dismissed, if the motion to dismiss theclass action is denied, or if either party v
oluntarily chooses to lift the stay.On
 May 8, 2019, a second derivative action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative suit is brought by an allegedstockholder
 of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, one former Oracle executive,and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff
 claims that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class115

action
 discussed  above  caused  harm  to  Oracle,  and  plaintiff  raises  further  allegations  of  impropriety  relating  to  Oracle’s  stock  buybacks  and  acquisition  ofNetSuite.
 Plaintiff asserts claims for violation of securities laws, violation of fiduciary duties, contribution and indemnification. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that thecase
 may proceed as a derivative action, and seeks damages, declaratory and other equitable relief, attorneys’ and expert fees and costs. On June 4, 2019, thecourt
 issued an order finding that this case was related to the derivative case above and staying the case under the court’s prior stay order. On July 8, 2019,plaintiffs in the 
two  derivative actions filed a consolidated complaint. The actions remain stayed.  While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, 
we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Other Litigation
We
 are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedingsand
 claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matterscannot
 be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that arematerially in excess of 
amounts already recognized, if any.
