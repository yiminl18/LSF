PART I
 
Item 1.  Business.
 
Unless the context otherwi
se requires, the terms "we," "us" and "our" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Best Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. Any references to our website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the websites.
 
Description of Business
 
We were incorporated in the state of 
Minnesota in 1966. We are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology. We do that by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their home
s. We have operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
Segments and Geographic Areas
 
We have two reportable segments: 
Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations, including our Best Buy Health business, in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. under various brand names including Best Buy, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, 
CST, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Lively, Magnolia and Pacific Kitchen and Home and the domain names bestbuy.com and greatcall.com. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobi
le and Geek Squad and the domain names bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx. 
During the third quarter of fis
cal 2021 we made the decision to exit our operations in Mexico and expect operations to cease during fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2020 we acquired all of the outstan ding shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”) and the predictive healthcar e technology business of BioSensics, LLC (“BioSe
nsics”). In fiscal 2019 we acquired all of the o utstanding shares of GreatCall, Inc. (“GreatCall”). Refer to Note 2, Restructuring , and Note 3, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and  Supplementary Data
, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K fo r additional information. 
Operations
 
Our Domestic and International 
segments are managed by leadership teams responsible for all areas of the business. Both segments operate a multi-channel platform that allows customers to come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. 
Domestic Segment
 
Development of merchandise and se
rvice offerings, pricing and promotions, procurement and supply chain, online and mobile application operations, marketing and advertising and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed. In addition, support capabilities (for example, human resources, finance, informat
ion technology and real estate management) are generally performed at our corporate headquarters. We also have field operations that support retail, services and in-home teams from our corporate headquarters and regional locations. Our retail stores have procedures for inventory management, a
sset protection, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales and services, staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized. All stores generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for st
ore management to address certain local market characteristics. 
International Segment
 
Our Canada and Mexico operations are 
similar to operations in our Domestic segment. 
Merchandise and Services
 
Our Domestic and International 
segments have offerings in six revenue categories. The key components of each revenue category are as follows: 
·
Computing and Mobile Phones - computing (including desk tops, notebooks and peripherals), mobile phones (including related mobile network carrier commissions), networking, tablets (including e-readers) and wearables (including smartwatches);·
Consumer Electronics - digital imaging, hea lth and fitness, home theater, portable audio (including headphones and portable speakers) and smart home;·
Appliances - large appliances (including dishwashers, laundry, ovens and refrigerators) and small appliances (including blenders, coffee makers and vacuums);·
Entertainment - drones, gaming (includin g hardware, peripherals and software), movies, music, toys, virtual reality and other software;·
Services - consultation, delivery, design, health-related services, installation, memberships, repair, set-up, technical support and warranty-related services; and·
Other - beverages, snacks, sundry ite ms and other product offerings within our International segment (including baby, furniture, luggage and sporting goods).4

  
Distribution
 
Domestic Segment
 
Customers who purchase product on
line have the choice to pick up product at a Best Buy store (including curbside pick-up at most stores), at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes. Our ship-from-store capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for cu
stomers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers located throughout the U.S. 
International Segment
 
Our Canada and Mexico
 distribution models are similar to our Domestic segment distribution models. 
Suppliers and Inventory
 
Our Domestic and International 
segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2021 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 80% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, LG and Sony – representing approximately 57% of total me
rchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements. 
We carefully monitor and 
manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements to our inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjust
ment of inventory receipt levels and pricing, agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products. 
We also have a global sourc
ing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our exclusive brands products. 
Store Development
 
We had 1,126 large-format and 33 smal
l-format stores at the end of fiscal 2021 throughout our Domestic and International segments. Our stores are a vital component of our multi-channel strategy and we believe they are an important competitive advantage. We also have vendor store-within-a-store concepts to a
llow closer vendor partnerships and a higher quality customer experience. We continuously look for opportunities to optimize our store space, renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations to support our operations. 
Refer to Item 7, 
Management's Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for tables reconciling ou r Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years. 
Intellectual Property
 
We own or have the right to use valuab
le intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including, but not limited to, Best Buy, Best Buy Essentia ls, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, Best Buy Mobile, CST, Dynex, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Insignia, Jitterbug, Lively, Magnolia, Modal, My Bes
t Buy, Pacific Kitchen and Home, Pacific Sales, Platinum, Rocketfish, 5Star and our Yellow Tag  logo.  
We have secured domestic and inte
rnational trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands. We have also secured patents for many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company, our stores, our pro
ducts and our websites. 
Seasonality
 
Our business, like that of many 
retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
Working Capital
 
We fund our business operations through a 
combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes and investment and growth opportunities. Our working 
capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales. 
5

 Competition
 
Our competitors are primarily multi-ch
annel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to help customers online, in stores and in their homes and to connect techno
logy product and solutions with customer needs provides us key competitive advantages. Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and servi
ce providers, as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have price-matching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail stores and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining effic
ient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people, our integrated online, retail and in-home assets, our broad and curated product asso rtment, our strong vendor partnerships, our ser
vice and support offerings designed to solve real customer needs, our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage. 
Environmental and Social Impact
 
We strive to be a good corporate cit
izen in all of our interactions with stakeholders, including customers, employees, vendor partners, shareholders, the environment and communities in which we operate.  
Environmental
 
Minimizing carbon e
missions in our operations is a priority at Best Buy. We have achieved significant progress toward our carbon-reduction goal of 75 percent by 2030 (over a 2009 baseline), from both operational reductions and renewable sourcing. In fiscal 2021 we signed The Climate Pledge, committing to be carbon neutra
l across our operations by 2040 – a decade earlier than our previous goal of 2050. We also made our second investment in solar energy that is expected to produce 480,000 MWh of clean electricity per year. 
We also have a goal to help our custo
mers reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent by 2030 (over a 2017 baseline), which we estimate will save them $5 billion on utility bills by putting greater emphasis on ENERGY STAR® electronics, appliances and other energy-saving devices. In addition, we collected mo
re than 161 million pounds of consumer electronics and appliances for recycling in fiscal 2021, bringing our total to more than 2 billion pounds.  
Social Impact
 
We are committed to supporting teens f
rom disinvested communities in building brighter futures through technology, training and mentorship. The primary way we do this is through our network of Best Buy Teen Tech Centers, places where teens ca n develop critical skills through hands-on activities that explore th
eir interests in a variety of areas, such as software engineering, filmmaking, 3D design and music production. Teens gain exposure to new ca reer possibilities and benefit from positive adult and peer relationships. Together with our partners, we are building a network of at least 100 Best Buy Teen Tech 
Centers, which we estimate will reach 30,000 teens annually. We accelerated our progress towards this goal by making a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We are currently serving teens at 35 Best Buy Teen Tech Centers.
 
In fiscal 2021 we committed to p
rovide $44 million by 2025 to expand college preparation and career opportunities for Black, Indigenous and People of Color (“BIPOC”) students, including adding 16 scholarships for Historically Black Colleges and Universities students and increasing scholarship funding for Best 
Buy Teen Tech Center youth. 
We are a founding member of ConnectedM
N, a public-private partnership helping disinvested communities across the state of Minnesota get access to the Internet and devices to facilitate distance learning as well as critical support services.  
We are also committed to respe
cting and advancing human rights through our alignment with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Further, across all of the products and services we procure, we seek to mitigate risk, enhance the partnership with our suppliers and create valu
e for all stakeholders through our Responsible Supply Chain Program. We are active members of the Responsible Business Alliance, which allows us to partner with many of the brands we sell, including Apple, Intel, Microsoft and Samsung. Collectively, we embrace a common Supplier 
Code of Conduct and audit methodology that creates business value by improving working and environmental conditions in the supply chain.

ronmental and social impact, please see our annual Environmental, Social & Governance Report, found on our website at www.investors.bestbuy.com.

 Human Capital Management
 
We aim to attract, retain and develop the be
st employees. At the end of fiscal 2021 we employed app roximately 102,000 employees in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, comprised of approximately 60% full-time employees, 35% part-time employees and 5% seasonal/occasional employees.  
Training and Development
  
Investing in our employees
’ learning and development is a priority at Best Buy. Our learning and development experience combines instructor-led classes and interactive online modules, along with one-on-one mentoring and coaching. In fiscal 2021 our em ployees each received an average of 40 hours of training and we suc
cessfully transitioned all meetings and events to virtual environments due to COVID-19 restrictions.  
Inclusion and Diversity
 
We believe in maintaining a su
pportive and inclusive culture that values everyone’s talents, life experiences and backgrounds. In fiscal 2021 we committed to making systemic, permanent changes that address social injustices to improve our company and our communities.  
·
We are proud of the diversity within our Board of Directors, comprised of 45% female directors and 36% of directors who are People of Color as of March 18, 2021. ·
We are committed to filling one out of thre e new, non-hourly corporate positions with BIPOC (specifically Black, Latinx and Indigenous) employees. ·
We are also committed to filling one out of three new, non-hourly field roles with women. ·
In the next two years, our Digital and Technology team committed to hiring 1,000 new employees, of which we commit 30% will be BIPOC or female employees. ·
We are focused on taking steps to foster inclusion among all employee groups to create parity in retention rates, including transforming the composition of our senior leadership teams to be more in line with our Board of Directors.  
Benefits
 
We are committed to taking care of ou
r employees and rewarding them for their hard work and dedication through a competitive rewards package of pay, benefits, discounts and opportunities. Our benefits package focuses on total employee well-being: physical, mental, fin ancial and social.
 
·
In fiscal 2021 we increased the starting hourly wage for all domestic employees to $15 per hour. And, to improve on pay predictability, a 4% increase in hourly rate replaced short-term incentive compensation for hourly store employees below the leadership level.·
In support of the changing lives of our employees due to COVID-19, we enhanced our employee benefits package to include 100% coverage of COVID-related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leave, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring reimbursement and access to physical and me
ntal health virtual visits.  
Safety
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organ
ization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease ("COVID-19") as a pandemic. In response to the pandemic, the safety of our employees and customers became a top priority. We proactively closed stores at the beginning of the pandemic and then implemented a contactless, cu
rbside-only operating model, and we continue to offer curbside pick-up at most stores today. When customers returned to shopping in our stores, we instituted a variety of safety procedures to keep our employees and customers safe, including requiring the use of
 face coverings, requiring employees to complete daily wellness checks and frequent cleaning protocols. We are also limiting the number of customers inside our stores to allow for CDC-recommended social distancing.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 
Described below are ce
rtain risks we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. The risks are categorized using the following headings: external, strategic, operational, regulatory and legal, and financial and market. Each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction 
with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, l
iquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial pe
rformance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.
 
External Risks
  
The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, opera
tions and financial condition to a number of risks, and those risks may intensify or last for an extended period of time.  
Risks Related to Sales and Cust
omer Demand: At various times during f iscal 2021, the pandemic and the operational changes we have made have resulted in significant reductions in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores. The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our business, operations and financ
ial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration of the pandemic; the extent of the impact on global and regional economies and economic activity, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemplo
yment rates, consumer discretionary spending and consumer confidence; actions governments take, including governments’ positions towards monetary and/or fiscal policy, including potential stimulus or the timing and nature of loosening of restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic and 
its resurgence; actions businesses and individuals take in their ongoing responses to the pandemic; and our ability to successfully navigate those impacts. COVID-19 has caused consumers to allocate a higher share of wallet to consumer electronics. After the pandemi
c, consumers might shift their spending back towards categories or industries that were affected by the pandemic and away from consumer electronic categories. In addition, the pandemic has caused some products and services to be in high demand, and we may not be able to meet this demand in al
l of our categories due to product shortages or decisions by our vendors to allocate products to certain customers due to the circumstances resulting from the pandemic, and our vendors may increase prices, each of which may adversely impact our revenue and profitability. The pande
mic has, and may continue to, negatively impact our products and services that historically have been more likely to be purchased in a physical store than online.  
Risks Related to Operations
: The pandemic has forced us to make a number of operat ional changes. Although we continue to offer a contactless, curbside model for those who prefer to shop that way, we could be required to return to a curbside-only model or close stores due to the current or future resurgence of the pandemic. Ou
r ability to continue to sell our products and services is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety of our customers and those employees who are needed to work at our stores and distribution facilities. Failure to maintain the recommended or required safety standard
s as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local governments could also result in an increased risk of regulatory action or civil litigation. The ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVI
D-19. While we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our customers and employees, these measures may not be successful, and we may be required to temporarily close d
istribution centers or stores from time to time, halt certain services or take other measures. Also, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, whi
ch could adversely affect our business in the future. Additionally, while we have continued to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and customers as we continue to operate during the pandemic, we face an increased risk of litigation related to our operat
ing environments. Preparing for and responding to the continuing pandemic could divert management’s attention from our key strategic priorities; increase costs as we prioritize health and safety matters for our employees and customers; cause us to reduce, delay, alter or aban
don initiatives that may otherwise increase our long-term value; or otherwise disrupt our business operations. 
Risks Related to Profitability
: To the extent COVID-19 continues to cause funda mental shifts in the channels in which customers choose to engage us, our profitability and our profitability rate may be adversely impacted. For example, at various times in fiscal 2021, we continued to pay rent for a number of physical stores that 
were closed and not generating sales (and we may need to do so again in the future), our online mix of products and services generally produces lower gross profit rates than in-store sales, and we offer some products and services that historically are more likely to be purchased 
in a physical store than online. We also do not offer or have limited digital and online offerings for certain products and services that have higher profitability rates. To the extent we are not able to maintain or increase the level of customer traffic in our stores or maintain or enable a more profitab
le mix of sales in our digital and online channels, our profitability and profitability rates may be materially negatively impacted. We have also incurred additional costs due to the operational changes we have made in response to the pandemic, and these costs have adversely impa
cted our profitability. As a result of disruptions to our supply chain, primarily due to mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured, we are experiencing, and may continue to experience, increased costs for shipping and transportation resources. If we are unable to manage these co
sts and supply chain disruptions, our profitability may be adversely impacted. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we could experience a longer-term impact on our costs, for example, the need for enhanced health and hygiene requirements in one or more reg
ions in attempts to counteract future outbreaks. In the event of decreased store traffic, certain of our stores may not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses, which could adversely affect the value of our owned and leased properties, potentially requiring us to
 record more significant non-cash impairment charges in future periods. 
8

 Risks Related to Our Debt a
nd Global Financing Markets: Although we repaid in ful l the amounts we had borrowed under our revolving credit facility during fiscal 2021, we may find it necessary to increase our cash position and our short-term debt in the future in response to further resurgences of COVID-19. In the event 
we are required to raise capital, our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our prospects, our credit ratings, and our business and indust
ry outlook. There is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.  
COVID-19, and the volatile 
regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we have identified in this section, which in turn could materially adverse
ly affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Further, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present signif
icant risks to our operations.  
Macroeconomic pressures in the ma
rkets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, the effects of COVID-19, may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results. 
To varying degrees, our products and ser
vices are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example: 
•
 whether or not they make a purchase;•
 their choice of brand, model or price-point;•
 how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and•
 their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans). 
Real GDP growth, consume
r confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adver
sely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. Geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
 
Future outbreaks, epidemics and/or pandemics could adve
rsely impact our operating results. 
The risk of or actual occurren
ce of national, international or global outbreaks, epidemics, and/or pandemics, could have a material adverse impact on our business, including but not limited to, our sales and customer demand, operations and supply chain, financial results, capital financing or other financing ac
tivities and all other stated risks identified in these risk factors. 
Catastrophic events could adversely affect ou
r operating results. 
The risk or actual occurren
ce of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may be caused by, for example: 
•
 natural disasters or extreme weather events;•
 diseases or pandemics (including COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners;•
 floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers; or•
 terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts. 
In recent years, we have observed an in
crease in the number and severity of certain catastrophic events in many of our markets. Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and d
istribution network. They can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders.  
Further, external social act
ivism, tension and violence resulting from external events impacting social justice and inequality, and our position and response to them, may adversely affect our employees, customers, properties and the communities in which we operate. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we 
may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. 
Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancemen
t, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences. 
We operate in a highly and inc
reasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption. This manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cy
cles. 
9

 This rapid pace of change can be hard to predi
ct and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; excess 
inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to ou
r brand and reputation. In addition, consumer preferences may be influenced even further as the social and economic environment navigates through the COVID-19 pandemic. These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitab
ility. 
Strategic Risks
  
We face strong competition fro
m multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability. 
While we constantly 
strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-t
ime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consume
rs. Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us. 
The retail sector has 
experienced an immense increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, as well as online sales for both in-store or curbside pick-up. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and 
low-cost or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Be
cause our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our 
margins. As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability. 
If we fail to attract, retain and engage approp
riately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. In addition, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability. 
Our performance is highly dependent on att
racting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate 
in the retail sector is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include, for example, employee engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, compet
ition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportun
ities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations. 
We operate in a competitive 
labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our increase in the starting hourly wage for all domestic employees implemented in fiscal 2021, as well as continued market p
ressure to increase employee hourly wage rates, increased cost pressure on employer-provided benefits. Our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material adverse impact to the profitability of our
 business. 
Our strategy to expand into new products, services and 
technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks. 
As we introduce new products and 
services, using new technologies and applications, we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we ma
y be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, failures or other issues. For example, as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology, we are subject to privacy and information security rules, such as th
e Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and/or subject to increased potential liability risk. 
This expanded risk increa
ses the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees, operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. In addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pi
lots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise. 
In fiscal 2021 we continued to in
vest in our health strategy and our underlying purpose to enrich lives through technology. The new health-related services offered might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of these services. In addition, the services and systems used could expose us to customer data pr
ivacy and information security risks, as well as business or system interruption risks. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. 
10

 Our focus on services as a strategic priori
ty exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation. 
We offer a full range of servi
ces that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. Designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to increment
al risks. These risks include, for example: 
•
 pressure on services attachment as a result of the sustained increase in consumer desire to purchase product offerings online and through mobile applications;•
 increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises;•
 pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs;•
 increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;•
 unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;•
 employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;•
 the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;•
 employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the privacy of the data they hold; •
 the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake;•
 the risk that in-home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and catastrophic events; and•
 increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services. 
Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network car
riers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability. 
We source the products we sel
l from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2021 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 80% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers - Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, LG and Sony - representing approximately 57% of total me
rchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise 
we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory wa
rranties. While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages - for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stor
es or online channels or their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. General
ly, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition for those products. In addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer 
certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms. 
We are also depende
nt on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if ca
rriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition,
 our carriers may also serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels. 
Demand for the products and services we sell could decline i
f we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focus on consumer experience. 
We operate a portfolio of brands w
ith a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success. Operational factors, such as failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promise
s or business interruptions, could damage our reputation. External factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that 
is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor 
relationship issues, all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability. 
We are subject to risks associated with company t
ransformation. 
Our transformational activ
ities within the organization are necessary to fully support our strategic vision for future customer and income growth, including our Building the New Blue Strategy, and any decreased capability to undertake those activities may have a material adverse impact on achieving that strategy.
 
11

 Any limitations in organizational, 
financial or operational infrastructure could decrease our ability to realize transformational objectives supporting our key strategic initiatives relating to our development of competitive advantages, creating solutions for customers and providing differentiated value. If we do not have access to, or fai
l to dedicate, the appropriate people, management focus and resources to implementing these transformational objectives, our long-term growth and profitability could be adversely affected. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has further de
monstrated the necessity for transformation, and as a result, has increased pressure on the timeline of these activities. The increased pressure to transform quickly and accelerate the implementation of the strategy could have an adverse impact on the overall implementat
ion performance of these objectives and our long-term growth and profitability.  As an example, we have seen that our online mix of products and services generally produces lower profit margins than in-store sales. Therefore, the continued transformation to a more digitally-driven business after COVID-1
9 could put sustained pressure on our costs and profitability. 
Failure to effectively manage strategic ventu
res, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business. 
We may decide to ent
er into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, "new ventures"). Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty, and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, 
for example: 
•
 different and incremental business risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments;•
 failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;•
 uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;•
 failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;•
 failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;•
 failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;•
 unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;•
 disputes or strategic differences with other third-party participants in the new venture; and•
 adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture. 
If new ventures are unsuccessful, ou
r liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and management's attention from other important areas of our business.
 
Failure to effectively manage our real esta
te portfolio may negatively impact our operating results. 
Effective management of our real estate portfo
lio is critical to our multi-channel strategy. Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are leased, of which some are subject to long-term lease
s. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example: 
•
 changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving multi-channel environment;•
 the location and appropriate number of stores, supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio;•
 the interior layout, format and size of our stores;•
 the products and services we offer at each store;•
 the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;•
 the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store; and•
 the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents. 
If we fail to effectively e
valuate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms, or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example: 
•
 closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;•
 incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;•
 operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and•
 bearing excessive lease expenses. 
These consequences
 could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity. 
For leased property, the financia
l impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to 
influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are typically still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similar
ly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant. 
12

 Operational Risks
 
Interruptions and other factors a
ffecting our supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business. 
Our supply chain is a cr
itical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors' abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, at the right time and in the right quantities. We a
lso depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to: 
•
 interruptions to our delivery capabilities;•
 failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;•
 disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;•
 limitations in capacity;•
 consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;•
 labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;•
 diseases, pandemics (including COVID-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns;•
 damages or other loss to products; •
 increasing transportation costs; and •
 the COVID-19 pandemic and disruptions as a result of efforts to control or mitigate the pandemic (such as facility closures, governmental orders, outbreaks, and/or transportation capacity). 
It is important that we mainta
in optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for sma
ll parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could expe
rience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability. 
We utilize third-party vendors 
for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationship or their services may have an adverse impact on our business. 
We engage key third-party busine
ss partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer 
warranty, delivery and installation, technical support, transportation and insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationships with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structu
re and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods. 
Our exclusive brands products are subject to several addi
tional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results. 
Sales of our exclusive b
rands products, which include Best Buy Essentials, Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, as well as products such as Jitterbug and Lively branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. 
Most of these products are manufactured by contra ct manufacturers based in southeast Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results: 
•
 we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brands product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;•
 we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brands products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;•
 we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to COVID-19, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationship
s with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics or unforeseen natural disasters;•
 we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brands products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;•
 we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return-to-vendor rights;•
 we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacturing of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;•
 we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brands products;•
 our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply;•
 we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brands products or manufacturing processes; and•
 regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country-of-origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.
13

  
Maintaining consistent qua
lity, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brands products and the p
rofits we are able to generate from them. 
We are subject to risks associated with vendors tha
t source products outside of the U.S. 
Our ability to find qual
ified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tar
iffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics (including COVID-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are be
yond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies. These and other related issues could have a material a
dverse impact on our financial results. 
We rely heavily on our information technology sys
tems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
The effective and efficient operation of our bu
siness is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain manage
ment, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. 
Our information technology sy
stems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious a
ctions), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and usage errors by our employees. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenue
s and could threaten our ability to remain in operation. 
We face a heightened risk of cybersecurity at
tacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. 
We utilize comple
x information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our sy
stems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of cr
itical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation. 
Further, as our online sales have 
increased and have become critical to our growth, and as we have shifted to remote working arrangements for many employees, the risk of any interruption of our information technology system capabilities is heightened, as well as the risk that customer demand exceeds the capacity of our onl
ine operations. Any such interruption or capacity constraint could result in a deterioration of our ability to process online sales, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.  
Failure to prevent or effectively respond 
to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions. 
Our business involves the 
collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as wel
l as use third-party technology and systems which transmit information for a variety of activities. We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems. While we engage in significant data-protect
ion efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data system
s and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data, or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, 
we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which 
may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims. 
Sensitive customer data may a
lso be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure approp
riate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships. 
14

 Increasing costs associated 
with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, new laws, 
such as the California Consum er Privacy Act, are expanding our obligations to prote ct the privacy and security of customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materia
lly increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk. 
Product safety and quality concerns could have a mate
rial adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. 
If the products we sell fai
l to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulation
s and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. Recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on ou
r revenue and profitability. 
Changes to labor or employment laws o
r regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model. 
As an employer of approximate
ly 102,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example: 
•
 the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor Relations Board frequently considers;•
 laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and•
 laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide. 
Changes to laws and regulation
s such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability. 
Regulatory and Legal Risks
 
We are subject to statutory, regula
tory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
Our statutory, regulatory and legal en
vironments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to: 
•
 the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;•
 the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;•
 the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;•
 the financial, operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security; •
 the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyr
ight, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;•
 the impact of litigation trends, including class-action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and•
 the impact of the transition in presidential administrations and changes in the federal executive and legislative branches on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies, such as economic, fiscal, tax, ret ail, labor and social policies. 
The impact of the potential imple
mentation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, future trade disputes o
r future phases of trade negotiations with China could lead to the imposition of tariffs or other trade actions that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects, as we did in fiscal 2020. 
Further, the impact of potential changes 
in U.S. or other countries' tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, including additional guidance and legislation related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, could adversely affect 
our financial condition and results of operations. 
Regulatory activity that affe
cts the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters
.  
15

 Further, as the COVID-19 pandemic and 
community spread of the virus continues to persist, we will continue to face risk and uncertainty as it relates to state and local government orders, which may restrict how we do business and potentially impact our performance and profitability. 
Our international activities are subject to 
many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate. 
We operate retail location
s in Canada, and during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we made the decision to exit our operat ions in Mexico. In addition, most of our exclus ive brands products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. We also have wholly owned legal entities registe
red in various other foreign countries, including Barbados, Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius and the U.K. During fiscal 2021 our International segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our Internat
ional operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:

Financial and Market Risks
 
Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a ma
terial adverse effect on our profitability. 
As discussed above, our revenues a
re susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. However, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors' because of, for examp
le, our extended retail footprint and structure, our hourly pay structure, our differentiated service offerings or our levels of customer service. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our cos
ts could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives. 
We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate du
ring our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. 
A large proportion of our revenue and earn
ings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new product re
lease activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments, such as natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or 
interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, during fiscal 2021, we extended the holiday shopping season starting in mid-October, while clos
ing stores on Thanksgiving Day. These changes could bring additional unknown risks related to the sales performance of the holiday shopping season. As a result of these factors, there is risk that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected. 
Economic, regulatory and other developmen
ts could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs. 
We offer promotional financ
ing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe our financing programs generate inc
remental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2021 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. In addition, 
we earn profit-share income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotiona
l financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our abil
ity to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs.16

 In addition, we may experience p
ressure from lower profit-sharing revenue related to our private label and co-branded credit card arrangements, as the economic ramifications of COVID-19 may lead to higher credit card defaults over time, which would have an adverse effect on our profitability.
 
Constraints in the capital markets o
r our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. 
We need sufficient sources of 
liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our 
liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our 
sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availab
ility of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities, and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. 
Changes in our credit ratings may li
mit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs.Any future downgrades to our credit rat
ings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and a
re subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.
 
Failure to meet any financial perfor
mance guidance or other forward-looking statements we may provide to the public could result in a decline in our stock price. 
We may provide public gu
idance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. When we provide guidance, we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potent
ial shareholders, but such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accurate
ly forecast our growth rate and profit margins. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our 
revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business 
conditions worldwide. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce any guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.

Management's Discuss
ion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. 
Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes inc
luded in Item 8, Financial Statements an d Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and A nalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020, for discussion of the re
sults of operations for the year ended February 1, 2020, compared to the year ended February 2, 2019, which is incorporated by reference herein.

Overview 
Our purpose is to enrich l
ives through technology. We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations, including our Best Buy Health business, in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. under various brand names including Best Buy, Best 
Buy Business, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, CST, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Lively, Magnolia and Pacific Kitchen and Home and the domain names bestbuy.com and greatcall.com. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best Buy, 
Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain names bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021 we made the decision to exit our operations in Mexico. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring , of the Notes to Consolidated Financ
ial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements an d Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K fo r additional information. 
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nea
rest the end of January. Fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 included 52 weeks. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday sh
opping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
Comparable Sales
 
Throughout this MD&A, we refer to 
comparable sales. Comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores, websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable 
sales includes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. Stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or stores impacted by natural disasters, are excluded from comparable sa
les until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisitions are included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. Comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sa
les and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. Comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our International segment only). Online sales are inc
luded in comparable sales. Online sales represent those initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store, curbside, at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes. All periods presented ap ply this methodology consistently.
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organ
ization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic. All stores that were temporarily closed as a result of COVID-19 or operating a curbside-only operating model are included in comparable sales. 
On November 24, 2020, we announced our decis
ion to exit our operations in Mexico. As a result, all revenue from Mexico operations has been excluded from our comparable sales calculation beginning in December of fiscal 2021. 
On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close a
ll of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from our comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On October 1, 2018, we  acquired all outstanding share
s of GreatCall, Inc. (“GreatCall”) and on May 9, 2019, we acquired all outstanding shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”) . Consistent with our comp arable sales policy, the results of GreatCall are included in our comparable sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fisca
l 2020, and the results of CST are included in our comparable sales calculation beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. 
We believe comparable sa
les is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores, websites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varie
s across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods. 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
This MD&A include
s financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), as well as certain adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures, such as constant currency, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings pe
r share ("EPS"). We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance. For these reasons, our interna
l management reporting also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on investments, intangible as
set amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-GAAP financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. These non-GAAP financial measu
res should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP
 financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
24

 In our discussions of the operating 
results of our consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rate
s we use to convert the International segment’s operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. We also may use the term "constant currency," which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. We calculate those impact
s as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. We believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information
 to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates. 
Refer to the
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures  section below for detailed reconciliations of items impacting non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the presented periods. 
Business Strategy an
d COVID-19 Update 
In fiscal 2021 our Enterprise 
comparable sales grew 9.7% as we leveraged our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model and ability to shift quickly to digital, to meet what was clearly elevated demand for products that help customers work, learn, cook, entertain and connect in the
ir homes. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when and where they shopped with us to ensure it satisfied their need for safety and convenience. The pandemic environment underscored our purpose to enrich lives through technology, and the capabilitie
s we strengthened in fiscal 2021 will benefit us going forward as we execute our strategy. 
Our strong financial performan
ce allowed us to share our success with the community, our shareholders, and, importantly, our employees. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation to accelerate the progress towards our goal to reach 100 Teen Tech Centers across the U.S. 
We believe our Teen Tech Centers help to further our commitments towards economic and social justice in our communities by making a measurable difference in the lives of underserved teens who may not otherwise have access to technology. In addition, we resumed our share repu
rchase program during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and increased our quarterly dividend by 27% to $0.70 per share. For our employees, we provided hourly appreciation pay for those who were working on the frontlines, paid recognition bonuses to field employees and establ
ished multiple hardship funds for anyone impacted physically, emotionally or financially by COVID-19. Starting August 1, 2020, we also raised our starting wage to $15 per hour for all domestic employees and enhanced our employee benefits.  
Throughout the pandemic and across all the 
ways customers can shop, we adhered to safety protocols that limited store capacity, followed strict social distancing practices and used proper protective equipment, including requiring our employees and customers to wear masks. 
This COVID-19 pandemic and the 
shift in customer buying behavior underscores the importance of our strong multi-channel capabilities. In fiscal 2021 our Domestic online revenue grew 144% compared to last year. We believe it is essential to provide options that let customers choose what works best for them. To best ser
ve our customers during the pandemic, we had to be innovative and flexible. Early in the year, we quickly rolled out enhanced curbside pick-up across our stores to provide our customers convenience when we made the difficult decision to close our stores in March 2020. In May 2020 we deve
loped an in-store appointment model that provided our customers with an option to shop in our stores as we prepared to open stores back up to customer shopping. We developed solutions like virtual consultations with advisors and video chats with our store associates. In add
ition, we made significant improvements to the functionality and customer experience of our app to support shopping, support and fulfillment. We provided fulfillment options that customers have come to expect from all retailers like fast and free home delivery, in-store pick-up and
 curbside pick-up. 
As we look forward, the env
ironment is still evolving, and our operating model and supporting cost structure are evolving as well. The pandemic has accelerated the evolution of retail and compelled us to change our operating model in the best interest of our employees and customers. We have also expedited some planned strateg
ic changes that we believe will allow us to emerge from this time even stronger. 
During the third quarter of fis
cal 2021 we made the difficult decision to exit our operations in Mexico and began taking other actions to more broadly align our organizational structure in support of our strategy. As a result, we recorded $144 million of charges in our International segment in fiscal 2021, including $23
 million of inventory markdowns within cost of sales and $121 million within restructuring charges primarily comprised of asset impairments, currency translation adjustments and termination benefits. As of January 30, 2021, the exit was substantially complete and we do not expect to incur materia
l future restructuring charges in fiscal 2022 related to the exit.  
We also recorded $133 mil
lion of restructuring charges in our Domestic segment in fiscal 2021, primarily related to termination benefits associated with field and corporate organizational changes in support of our strategy, as well as impairments of technology assets held in service of our Mexico operations.
  
As we continue to evolve our Bu
ilding the New Blue Strategy, it is possible that we will incur material future restructuring costs, but we are unable to forecast the timing and magnitude of such costs. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, 
Financial Statements an d Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K fo r additional information. 
25

 We believe the following will be perma
nent and structural implications of the pandemic relevant to Best Buy: 
•
 Customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality, and lead, not follow.•
 Our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while also providing more flexible opportunities for our people.•
 Technology is playing an even more crucial role in people’s lives, and, as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. Said differently, people are using technology to address their needs in ways they never contemplated before, and we play a vital role in b
ringing technology to life for both customers and our vendor partners. 
These implications are e
xtensive and interdependent, and we are, as quickly as possible, both implementing change today and assessing future changes across our entire business, including how we evolve our stores and labor model, and how we spend our investment dollars.‌  
In summary, during fisca
l 2021 we managed through the challenging environment in a way that allowed us to accelerate many aspects of our strategy to deliver on our purpose. Our teams showed perseverance and commitment through the year and collectively changed the way we do business at a pace we
 never imagined.  
Results of Operations
 
In order to align our fiscal 
reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements, we consolidate the financial results of our Mexico operations on a one-month lag. Consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non-financial information presented in our MD&A relative to these operations is also presented on a 
lag. Our policy is to accelerate the recording of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. Other than the restructuring charges incurred related to our decision to exit our operations in Mexico, no such events were identified fo
r the periods presented.

Because retailers vary in how they  record costs of operating their s upply chain between cost of sales and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers' corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Signifi cant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to  Consolidated Financial Stateme
nts, included in Item 8, Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
In fiscal 2021 we generated $47.3 bil
lion in revenue and our comparable sales increased 9.7%. The impact of the pandemic drove strong customer demand for products to help them work, learn, cook, entertain and connect in their homes. Our strong sales performance resulted in operating income rate expansion of 50 basis po
ints compared to fiscal 2020. 
Revenue, gross profit rate, SG&A 
rate and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2021 were primarily driven by our Domestic segment. For further discussion of each segment's rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary,  below.

The increase in revenue in fi
scal 2021 was primarily driven by the comparable sales growth across most of our product categories, partially offset by the loss of revenue from permanent store closures in the past year. Online revenue of $18.7 billion increased 144.4% on a comparable basis in fiscal 2021, primar
ily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic as we saw a channel shift in our customer shopping behavior as a result of COVID-19. 
Domestic segment stores open at the end of each of the 
last three fiscal years, excluding stores that were temporarily closed as a result of COVID-19 in fiscal 2021, were as follows:

Continued strong demand in categorie
s that help our customers work, learn, cook, entertain and connect from home contributed to our Domestic comparable sales changes across most of our categories. Notable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows: 
•
 Computing and Mobile Phones:  The 13.0% comparable sales gro wth was driven primarily by computing, tablets and networking, partially offset by declines in mobile phones.•
 Consumer Electronics: The 0.2% comparable sales dec line was driven primarily by headphones and digital imaging, partially offset by growth in home theater.•
 Appliances: The 23.2% comparable sales gro wth was driven by both large and small appliances.•
 Entertainment: The 17.9% compara ble sales growth was driven primarily by gaming and virtual reality, partially offset by declines in movies.•
 Services: The 1.4% comparable  sales decline was primarily driven by our repair, delivery and installation services. 
27

Our gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher supply chain costs as a result of the increased mix of online revenue and lower profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement, partially offset by a more favorable promotional environment.
 
Our SG&A decreased in fisca
l 2021 primarily due to lower store payroll expense and other actions taken at the onset of the pandemic, such as the temporary suspension of the 401(k) employer match, reduced advertising and lower store overhead expenses. These decreases were partially offset by increases in var
iable costs associated with higher sales volume and a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation. Lower store payroll expense was primarily due to fewer labor hours as a result of reduced store operating hours, lower store-generated revenue and efficiencies in our labor model, which was 
partially offset by increased wage rates. SG&A also includes $81 million of employee retention credits as a result of the Federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. 
Restructuring charges in f
iscal 2021 related to termination benefits associated with actions taken to more broadly align our organ izational structure in support of our strategy. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring,  of the Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial  Statements and Supplementary Data
, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K fo r additional information. 
Our operating income rate increa
sed in fiscal 2021 primarily driven by increased leverage from higher sales volume on our fixed expenses, which resulted in favorable SG&A rates, partially offset by the decrease in gross profit rate and restructuring charges described above.

 Similar to the Domest
ic segment, strong demand in categories that help our customers work, learn, cook, entertain and connect from home contributed to our International comparable sales changes across most of our categories. Notable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:
 
•
 Computing and Mobile Phones: The 23.8% comparable sales gro wth was driven primarily by computing, tablets and networking, partially offset by declines in mobile phones.•
 Consumer Electronics: The 0.3% comparable sales gro wth was driven primarily by home theater and health and fitness, partially offset by declines in smart home and digital imaging.•
 Appliances: The 20.9% comparable sales gro wth was driven by both small and large appliances.•
 Entertainment: The 52.1% compara ble sales growth was driven primarily by gaming and virtual reality.•
 Services: The 11.0% compara ble sales decline was driven primarily by warranty and repair services.•
 Other: The 9.4% comparable  sales growth was driven primarily by baby products. 
Our gross profit rate declined 
in fiscal 2021 primarily due to operations in Canada, which was largely driven by higher supply chain costs as a result of the increased mix of online revenue and a lower mix of higher margin services revenue. Gross profit also decreased $23 million as a result of inventory markdowns ass
ociated with our decision to exit our operations in Mexico. 
Our SG&A decreased in fisca
l 2021 primarily due to operations in Canada as a result of lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation. 
Restructuring charges in fiscal 
2021 primarily related to asset impairments, currency translation adjustments and termination benefits associated with our decision to exit our operations in Mexico. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring,  of the Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements, included in  Item 8, 
Financial Statements an d Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K fo r additional information. 
Our operating income rate decreased 
in fiscal 2021 primarily driven by restructuring charges and the lower gross profit rate described above, partially offset by a favorable SG&A rate driven by increased leverage from higher sales volume on our fixed expenses. 
Additional Consolidated Results
 
Other Income (Expense)
 
Our investment income and other decrea
sed in fiscal 2021 primarily due to less favorable interest rates on our investments, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of a minority equity investment. 
Interest expense decreased in fisca
l 2021 primarily due to more favorable interest rates related to our interest rate swap contracts, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of our short-term draw on our $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 8, 
Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements an d Supplementary Data, of this Annual Repor t on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility.  
Income Tax Expense
 
Income tax expense increased in f
iscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in pre-tax earnings. Our effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in losses for which tax benefits were not recognized, a decrease in the tax benefit from stock-based compensation and the impact of higher pre-tax earning
s on discrete tax benefits, partially offset by an increase in the tax benefit from federal tax credits and the resolution of discrete tax matters.

Represents inventory markdowns r ecorded within cost of sales associated with the decision to exit operations in Mexico.(2)
Represents a price-fixing litigatio n settlement received in relation to products purchased and sold in prior fiscal years.(3)
Represents charges associate d with acquisitions, including: (1) the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships, tradenames and developed technology; and (2) acquisition-related transaction costs primarily comprised of professional fees.(4)
Represents charges associate d with actions taken to better align the company’s organizational structure with its strategic focus and the decision to exit operations in Mexico in fiscal 2021, charges and subsequent adjustments associated with U.S. retail operating model changes in fiscal 2020, and charges and subsequent adjustments primarily associated with the closure of Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores i
n the U.S. in fiscal 2019.(5)
Represents adjustments resultin g from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“tax reform”) enacted into law in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, including amounts associated with a deemed repatriation tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as a one-time bonus for certain employees in response to future tax savings created by tax reform.(6)
Represents an increase in the fair value of a mi nority equity investment in fiscal 2021 and a gain  on sale of investments in fiscal 2019.(7)
Represents the summation of th e calculated income tax charge related to each non-GAAP non-income tax adjustment. The non-GAAP adjustments primarily relate to the U.S. and Mexico. As such, the income tax charge is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 24.5% for all U.S. non-GAAP items for all periods presented. There is no income tax charge  for Mexico non-GAAP items, as there was no tax benefit r
ecognized on these expenses in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense. 
Our non-GAAP operating income rate 
increased in fiscal 2021 primarily driven by increased leverage from higher sales volume on our fixed expenses, which resulted in a favorable SG&A rate, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit rate. 
Our non-GAAP effective
 tax rate increased in fiscal 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit from stock -based compensation and the impact of higher pre-tax earnings on discrete tax benefits, partially offset by an increase in the tax benefit from federal tax credits and the resolution of discrete t
ax matters. 
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS 
increased in fiscal 2021 primarily driven by increases in non-GAAP operating income and lower diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding from share repurchases.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
We closely manage our l
iquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capita
l management. Capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment. We have a disciplined approach to ca
pital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy. 
Cash and cash equivalen
ts were as follows ($ in millions): 
             
        
January 30, 2021  February 1, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents
$  5,494   $  2,229   
The increase in cash a
nd cash equivalents in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash f lows and a reduction in share repurchases, which were temporarily suspended from March to November of fiscal 2021.  
Cash Flows

  7     (1)     (14)  Increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash
$  3,270  $  171  $  884  
Operating Activities
 
The increase in cash provided b
y operating activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to higher inventory turnover and the timing of inventory purchases and payments to meet continued higher demand. The increase was also driven by the timing of payments related to accrued compensation and benefits and higher earn
ings. 
Investing Activities
 
The decrease in cash
 used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the absence of acquisitions. 
Financing Activities
 
The decrease in cash
 used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to lower share repurchases, which were temporarily suspended from March to November of fiscal 2021. 
Sources of Liquidity
 
Funds generated by operating activit
ies, available cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and strateg
ic initiatives, including business combinations. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our abil
ity to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms. 
We have a $1.25 
billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Facility”) with a syndicate of banks. Refer to Note 8, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements an d Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form  10-K for additional informat
ion on the terms of the Facility. In light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID-19 and to maximize liquidity, we executed a short-term draw on the full amount of the Facility on March 19, 2020, which remained outstanding until July 27, 2020, when the amounts we had borrowed under the Faci
lity were repaid in full. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Facility as of January 30, 2021, or February 1, 2020. 
Our ability to continue to acce
ss the Facility is subject to our compliance with its terms and conditions, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. As of January 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. If an event of default were to occur with re
spect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under the Facility as well.

 Our credit ratings and outlook as of 
March 18, 2021, are summarized below. On February 26, 2021, Moody’s upgraded its rat ing to A3 and confirmed its outlook of Stable. Standard & Poor’s rating and outlook remained unchanged from the prior year.

Credit rating agencies re
view their ratings periodically, and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electron
ics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. If changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, interest costs for certain of our credit facilities, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new
-store leasing costs. 
Restricted Cash
 
Our liquidity is also affected
 by restricted cash balances that are primarily restricted to use for workers' compensation and general liability insurance claims. Restricted cash, which is included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $131 million and $126 million as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respective
ly. 
Capital Expenditures
 
Our capital expenditures
 typically include investments in our information technology (including e-commerce), stores and distribution capabilities. Capital expenditures were as follows ($ in millions):

Store-related projects are primarily c omprised of store remodels and various merchandising projects.(2)
Total capital expenditures exclu de non-cash capital expenditures of $32 million, $10 million and $53 million in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. Non-cash capital expenditures are comprised of finance leases, as well as additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable. 
Debt and Capital
 
As of January 30, 2021, we had $500 mil
lion of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”) and $650 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2030 (“2030 Notes”). Upon issuance of our 2030 Notes, we cash settled the associated Treasur y Rate Lock ("T-Lock") contracts entered into in f
iscal 2021 to hedge the base interest rate variability on a portion of our then-expected refinancing of our maturing $650 million of principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (“2021 Notes”). The net proceeds from the 2030 Notes were used to replace our 2021 Notes that we retired in De
cember 2020 by exercising our option to redeem the notes at par. Refer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments , and Note 8, Debt , in the Notes to Consolidated F inancial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements an d Supplementary Data, of this  Annual Report on Form 10-K for further 
information about our T-Lock contracts and outstanding debt.  
Share Repurchases and Dividends
 
We repurchase our common stock and pa
y dividends pursuant to programs approved by our Board. The payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to 
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. 
On February 23, 2019, the Board authorized a $3.0 bil
lion share repurchase program. On February 16, 2021, the Board approved a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program, replacing the existing program which had $1.7 billion remaining available for repurchases as of January 30, 2021. There is no expiration date govern
ing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization. We temporarily suspended all share repurchases from March to November of fiscal 2021 to conserve liquidity in light of COVID-19-related uncertainties. Between the end  of fiscal 2021 on January 30, 2021, and March 18, 2021, 
we repurchased an incremental 8.1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $873 million. On February 25, 2021, we announced our plans to spend at lea st $2 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2022. 
Share repurchase an

 Dividends declared and pa
id increased in fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend per share. On February 25, 2021, we announced the Board’s approval of a 27 % increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. 
Other Financial Measures
 
Our current ratio, calculated a
s current assets divided by current liabilities, remained relatively unchanged at 1.2 as of January 30, 2021, compared to 1.1 as of February 1, 2020. Our debt to earnings ratio, calculated as total debt (including current portion) divided by net earnings, remained unchanged at 0.8 as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020.

Purchase obligations includ e agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they 
do not contain legally binding purchase commitments, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.(2)
Lease obligations exclud e $56 million of legally binding fixed costs for leases signed but not yet commenced. (3)
Operating lease obligatio ns exclude payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $0.7 billion as of January 30, 2021.(4)

Additionally, we have $1.25 b
illion in undrawn capacity on our Facility as of January 30, 2021, which if drawn upon, would be included as short-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Critical Accounting Estimates
 
The preparation of our financial state
ments requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experien
ce, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could 
be material. 
Our significant accounting
 policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accoun ting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements an d Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Othe r than our adoption of Accounting Standards Up
date (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases , in the first quarter of fisca l 2020, and our adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with  Customers, in the first quarter of fisca l 2019, we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal year
s. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and generally incorporate significant uncertainty.
 
Vendor Allowances
 
Description
We receive funds from our mer
chandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements for product advertising and product placement, primarily in the form of allowances based on purchases or sales volumes. We recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the as
sociated inventory is sold. Allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. Funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs in
curred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related expense when incurred. 
33

 Judgments and uncertainties invo
lved in the estimateDue to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendo
r agreements, estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory. These estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors, including (1) proper classification of the type of funding received; and (2) the methodolog
y to estimate the portion of purchases-based funding that should be recognized in cost of sales in each period, which considers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sell-through of inventory. 
Effect if actual results 
differ from assumptionsA 10% change in our vendor funding deferra
l as of January 30, 2021, would have affected net earnings by approximately $33 million in fiscal 2021. The overall level of deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three years. 
Goodwill
 
Description
Goodwill is not amort
ized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value reflects the pr
ice a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction. 
Judgments and uncertainties invo
lved in the estimateDetermining fair va
lue of a reporting unit is complex and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information, such as trading multiples and other observable metrics. Cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding many factors, such as revenue growth rates, expenses and capital expenditures. 
Market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables. We have goodwill in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health – with carrying values of $444 million and $542 million, respectively, as of January 30, 2021. There is greater uncertainty sur
rounding the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit and therefore a greater degree of complexity and judgment involved in our impairment analysis. Our valuation of Best Buy Health incorporates relatively higher levels of revenue gro
wth than our valuation of Best Buy Domestic and, consequently, estimation of factors such as new customer growth, customer retention rates, capital expenditure requirements, advertising and cost to serve expenses and weighted-average cost of capital rates that incorporate significa
nt judgment. 
Effect if actual results 
differ from assumptionsA 10% change in the fair value of the Be
st Buy Health reporting unit as of January 30, 2021, would not have had a material effect on our net earnings in fiscal 2021. Since acquisition, our estimate of the fair value of Best Buy Health has remained relatively stable. 
Inventory Markdown
 
Description
Our merchandise inventorie
s were $5.6 billion as of January 30, 2021. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments. Markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate 
sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. No adjustment is recorded for inventory that we are able to return to our vendors for full credit. 
Judgments and uncertainties invo
lved in the estimateMarkdown adjustments invo
lve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected revenue and incremental costs we will generate for current inventory. Such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates, as well as factors 
such as product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, promotional environment, vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition. We also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value, such as ve
ndor allowances and selling costs. 
Effect if actual results 
differ from assumptionsA 10% change in our markdown ad
justment as of January 30, 2021, would have affected net earnings by approximately $13 million in fiscal 2021. The level of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years. 
Tax Contingencies
 
Description
Our income tax returns are period
ically audited by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign taxing authorities. Taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax year
s are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, i
s audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes a
vailable. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. 
34

 Judgments and uncertainties invo
lved in the estimateOur liability for un
recognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors, such as changes in tax law, 
interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes, and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction, the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending. 
Effect if actual results 
differ from assumptionsAlthough we believe that the judgment
s and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established 
liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax sett
lement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 
Service Revenue
 
Description
We sell support plans as pa
rt of a bundled service offer which may include items such as technical support, price discounts on future purchases, anti-virus software and one-time service repairs. We allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair va
lue. For technical support services, we typically recognize revenue over time on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This method involves the estimation of expected usage patterns, primarily derived from historical information.
 
Judgments and uncertainties invo
lved in the estimateThere is judgment in (1) measu
ring the relative standalone selling price for bundled performance obligations, and (2) assessing the appropriate recognition and methodology for each performance obligation, and for those based on usage, estimating the expected pattern of consumption across a large portfolio of cu
stomers. When insufficient reliable and relevant history is available to estimate usage, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract until such history has accumulated. 
Effect if actual results 
differ from assumptionsA 10% change in the amount of service
s membership deferred revenue as of January 30, 2021, would have affected net earnings by approximately $13 million in fiscal 2021. The amount of services membership deferred revenue has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
 
For a description of new appl
icable accounting pronouncements, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accoun ting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements an d Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosu
res About Market Risk. 
In addition to the risks inherent 
in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks. 
Interest Rate Risk
 
We are exposed to changes in short-ter
m market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense. Our cash and cash equivalents generate interest income that will vary based on changes in short-term interest rates. In addition, we have swapped a portion of our fixed-rate debt to floating-rate su
ch that the interest expense on this debt will vary with short-term interest rates. Refer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments , and Note 8, Debt , of the Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary  Data
, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K fo r further information regarding our interest rate swaps. 
In fiscal 2021 we entered into T-Loc
k contracts to hedge the base interest rate variability on a portion of our then-expected refinancing of our maturing 2021 Notes. The T-Lock contracts were immaterial and cash settled upon issuance of our 2030 Notes in fiscal 2021. The fair value of the T-Lock contracts upon settlement wa
s released from Accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded in Interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as interest is accrued over the life of the 2030 Notes. 
As of January 30, 2021, we had $5.5 bill
ion of cash and cash equivalents and $500 million of debt that has been swapped to floating rate, and therefore the net balance exposed to interest rate change s was $5.0 billion. As of January 30, 2021, a 50-basis point increase in short-term interest rates would have led to an e
stimated $25 million reduction in net interest expense, and conversely a 50-basis point decrease in short-term interest rates would have led to an estimated $25 million increase in net interest expense. 
35

 Foreign Currency Exchange
 Rate Risk 
We have market risk ar
ising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International segment operations. On a limited basis, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases, recognized receivable and payable balance
s and our investment in our Canadian operations. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows, as well as net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our foreign currency risk management st
rategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments, which generally have terms of up to 12 months. Refer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments , of the Notes to Consolidated Financ ial Statements, included in Item 8, 
Financial Statements an d Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K fo r further information regarding these instruments. 
In fiscal 2021 foreign currenc
y exchange rate fluctuations were driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar compared to the prior- year period, which had a negative overall impact on our revenue as foreign currencies translated into fewer U.S. dollars. The strength of the U.
S. dollar compared to the Mexican peso also had a favorable impact on earnings as the operating loss in Mexican pesos translated into fewer U.S. dollars. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately $45 mi
llion and a net favorable impact on earnings of approximately $15 million in fiscal 2021, excluding the reclassification of cumulative tra nslation adjustments into earnings as a result of our exit from Mexico.

Management's Report on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Our management is responsible fo
r the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related financial information. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and necessarily include certain amounts that are based on estimates and informed 
judgments. Our management also prepared the related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements. 
The accompanying consolidated f
inancial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which conducted its audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The independent register
ed public accounting firm's responsibility is to express an opinion as to whether such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with GAAP. 
Management's Report on Inte
rnal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible fo
r establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financia
l officer, and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that:
 
(1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets;(2)
provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and Board; and
(3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
Because of its inherent li
mitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
Under the supervision and w
ith the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2021, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Frame work (2013). Based on our assessment, we have conc luded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 30, 2021. During our assessment, we did not identify any material 
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 30, 2021, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and  Supplementary Data,
 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, ha s issued an unqualified attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2021.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Dire
ctors of Best Buy Co., Inc.
 Richfield, Minnesota
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying conso
lidated balance sheets of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended Januar
y 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, and the results of its operat
ions and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordan
ce with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Int egrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponso ring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Change in Accounting Principle
The Company changed its method of accounting fo
r leases in fiscal year 2020 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 Leases  (Topic 842). Our o pinion is not modified with respect to this matter.Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the re
sponsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance 
with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordan
ce with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedure
s to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the finan
cial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter
s communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our espe
cially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the 
critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Vendor Allowances — 
Refer to Note 1 to the fi nancial statementsCritical Audit Matter Description
The Company receives vendor a
llowances from certain merchandise vendors through a variety of programs intended to offset the invoice cost of inventory and for promoting and selling merchandise inventory. Allowances based on purchases are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise invento
ry and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. Allowances based on sales volumes are based on merchandise sold and are calculated using an agreed upon amount for each unit sold and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the as
sociated inventory is sold. Other promotional allowances not specifically related to volume of purchases or sales, such as advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. Funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of 
specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor’s products are recorded as an offset to the related expense when incurred. Given the significance of vendo
r allowances to the financial statements and volume and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, auditing vendor allowances was complex and subjective due to the extent of effort required to evaluate whether the vendor allowances were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor ag
reements and that the allowances deferred as an offset to inventory were complete and accurate.38

 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Ad
dressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to evaluat
ing whether the vendor allowances were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements and the completeness and accuracy of deferred vendor allowances included the following, among others: ·
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the recording of vendor allowances, including management's controls over the establishment of vendor arrangements, the calculation of vendor allowances earned, and the determination of the deferred vendor allowances recorded as a reduction to inventory.
·
We selected a sample of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of cost of sales and (1) recalculated the amount recognized using the terms of the vendor agreement; (2) for certain arrangements, confirmed the terms of the agreement directly with the vendor; and (3) evaluated, based on the terms of the agreement, if the amount shou
ld be deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventory.·
Where confirmation responses from vendors were not received, we completed alternative procedures such as agreement to underlying contractual arrangements, tested the settlement of the arrangement and held discussions with a sample of Company buyers to understand the terms of the agreement.
·
We tested the amount of deferred vendor allowances recorded as a reduction to inventory by developing an expectation for the amount and comparing our expectation to the amount recorded by management. 
Goodwill — Best Buy
 Health Reporting Unit — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements 
The Company’s evaluation of good
will for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The goodwill balance was $986 million as of January 30, 2021, of which $542 million was related to the Best Buy Health reporting unit. The Company uses the discounted cash flow mode
l to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, which requires management to make subjective estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwi
ll impairment charge, or both. The fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized. 
Given the significant judg
ments made by management to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future revenue of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, specifica
lly for new products and services, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.  
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Ad
dressed in the Audit 
Our audit procedures related to the forecast
s of future revenue used by management to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit included the following, among others:  
·
We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, such as controls related to management’s forecasts of future revenue.·
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts. ·
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts for the new products and services by comparing the forecasts to: (1) the Company’s historical revenue growth rates, including for similar existing products and services; (2) internal communications to management and the board of directors; (3) under
lying source documents, when available, such as customer contracts; (4) underlying analyses detai ling business strategies and growth plans; (5) forward-looking revenue expectations in external communications mad e by management to analysts and investors; and 
(6) industry reports containing analyses of the Company and its peers utilizing the assistance of our fair value specialists.·
We inquired of operating and sales management teams to determine whether the judgments and assumptions used in the future revenue projections were consistent with the strategy and long-range plans for the Best Buy Health reporting unit.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Dire
ctors of Best Buy Co., Inc.
Richfield, Minnesota
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Repo
rtingWe have audited the internal contro
l over financial reporting of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Frame work (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponso ring Organizations of the Treadway Commiss
ion (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Frame work (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordan
ce with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 30, 2021, of the Company and our report dated March 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those finan
cial statements.Basis for Opinion
 The Company’s management is re
sponsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Contro l Over Financial Reporting
. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and t
he applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance 
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal 
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circum
stances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal 
Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as neces
sary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable a
ssurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent li
mitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of c
ompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
1.   Summary of Significant Accoun
ting Policies 
Unless the context otherwi
se requires, the use of the terms "Best Buy," "we," "us" and "our" in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refers to Best Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. 
Description of Business
 
Our purpose is to enrich l
ives through technology. We have two  reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations, including our Best Buy Health business, in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. under various brand names including Best Buy, Best 
Buy Business, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, CST, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Lively, Magnolia and Pacific Kitchen and Home and the domain names bestbuy.com and greatcall.com. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best Buy, 
Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad and the domain names bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx. 
During the third quarter of fis
cal 2021 we made the decision to exit our operations in Mexico. In fiscal 2020 we acquired all of the outstan ding shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”) and the predictive healthcar e technology business of BioSensics, LLC (“BioSensics”). In fiscal 2019 we 
acquired all of the o utstanding shares of GreatCall, Inc. (“GreatCall”). Refer to Note 2, Restructuring , and Note 3, Acquisitions , for additional information.  
COVID-19
 
In March 2020 the World Health Organ
ization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease ("COVID-19") as a pandemic. Except where otherwise directed by state and local authorities, we made the decision for the health and safety of our customers and employees to move our stores to a contactless, curbs
ide-only operating model in the fiscal first quarter. We also temporarily suspended in-home delivery, repair and consultation services. At the beginning of the fiscal second quarter, we started welcoming customers back into our stores by offering an in-store consultation service to cu
stomers, by appointment only. On June 15, 2020, we began allowing customers to shop without an appointment at more than 800  stores across the U.S. As of June 22, 2020, almost all of our stores were open for shopping. We continue to offer contactless curbside pick-up and in-
store consultations for customers who prefer to shop that way.  
In light of the uncertainty surround
ing the impact of COVID-19 and to maximize liquidity, we executed a short-term draw on the full amount of our $1.25  billion five year  senior unsecured revolving  credit facility (the “Facility”) on March 19, 2020, that remained outstanding until July 27, 2020, when the amounts we had borrowed under the Fac
ility were repaid in full. See Note 8, Debt , for additional information on the Fa cility. In March 2020 we also announced the temporary suspension of all share repurchases which we r esumed in November 2020.  
In the first quarter of fiscal 2021 
we concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our store operations was a triggering event to review for potential impairments of our store assets. As a result of this analysis, we recorded an immaterial asset impairment charge for a small number of stores within Selling, general a
nd administrative (“SG&A”) expenses. We also completed a revie w for potential impairments of our goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, concluding that no impairment had occurred. A similar conclusion was reached upon completion of our annual goodwill impairment review during the
 fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. 
On March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID
-19 pandemic, the U.S. Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which among other things, contains provisions for deferral of the employer portion of social security taxes incurred through the end of calendar 2020 and an employee retention cred
it, a refundable payroll credit for 50% of wages and health benefits paid to employees not providing services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the CARES Act, we deferred $142  million of qualified payroll taxes in fiscal 2021 and claimed the employee retention 
credit, which was treated as a government subsidy to offset related operating expenses. Based on our analysis of the CARES Act, we reduced our SG&A expenses in fiscal 2021 by $81  million for employee retention credits. 
The COVID-19 pandemic rema
ins an evolving situation. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results will depend on future developments, including the duration of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of wh
ich are highly uncertain. 
Basis of Presentation
 
The consolidated financial 
statements include the accounts of Best Buy Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions are elim inated upon consolidation. 
In order to align our fiscal 
reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements, we consolidate the financial results of our Mexico operations on a one-month lag. Our policy is to accelerate recording the effect of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial stat
ements. Other than as disclosed in Note 2, Restructuring , no such events were identified fo r the reported periods that would have materiall y affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had they been recorded during fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019.
 
46

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
The preparation of financial statement
s in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the disclosure of contingent
 liabilities. Future results could be materially affected if actual results were to differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
Fiscal Year
 
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nea
rest the end of January. Fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 included 52 weeks. 
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2021 
we prospectively adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, all of which had an immaterial impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
·
ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on F inancial Instruments·
ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Ot her (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment·
ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement -  Disclosure Framework (Topic 820)·
ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwil l and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract  
Segment Information
 
Our business is organized in
to two reportable segments: Domestic (which is comprised of all states, districts and territories of the U.S.) and International (which is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico). Our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is our Chief Executive Officer. 
Our CODM has ultimate re sponsibility for enterprise decisions, including determining resource allocation for, and monitoring the performance of, the consolidated enterprise, the Domestic reportable segment and the International reportable segment.  
Our CODM relies on 
internal management reporting that analyzes enterprise results to the net earnings level and reportable segment results to the operating income level. We aggregate our Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health operating segments into one Domestic reportable segment. We also aggregate our Canada and Mex
ico businesses into one International operating segment, which represents the International reportable segment. 
Business Combinations
 
We account for business comb
inations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodw
ill. Results of operations related to business combinations are included prospectively beginning with the date of acquisition and transaction costs related to business combinations are recorded within SG&A. 
Cash, Cash Equival
ents and Restricted Cash 
Cash primarily 
consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. The amounts of cash equivalents as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, were $
3,559  million and $ 1,668  million, respectively, and the  weighted-average interest rates were 0.6 % and 1.8 %, respectively. 
Cash, cash equivalents and rest
ricted cash reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is reconciled to the total shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows ($ in millions): 
                     
            
January 30, 2021  February 1, 2020  February 2, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents
$  5,494   $  2,229   $  1,980  Restricted cash included in Other current assets
  131     126     204  Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash
$  5,625   $  2,355   $  2,184   
Amounts included in restricte
d cash are primarily restricted to use for workers' compensation and general liability insurance claims. 
Receivables
 
Receivables consi
st primarily of amounts due from vendors for various vendor funding programs, banks for customer credit card and debit card transactions and mobile phone network operators for device sales and commissions. Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for expected
 credit losses, which is primarily based on historical collection trends. Our allowances for uncollectible receivables were $38  million and $24  million as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respectively. We had $88  million and $32  million of write-offs in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, resp
ectively. 
47

Merchandise Inventories 
Merchandise inventories a
re recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The weighted average method is used to determine the cost of inventory which includes costs of in-bound freight to move inventory into our distribution centers. Also included in the cost of inventory are certain vendor allowance
s. Costs associated with storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales. 
Our inventory valuation al
so reflects markdown adjustments for the excess of the cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate disposition of inventory, including consideration of any rights we may have to return inventory to vendors for a refund, and establishes a new cost basis. Subsequent changes in fact
s or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdown adjustments or an increase in the newly established cost basis. 
Our inventory valuation ref
lects adjustments for physical inventory losses (resulting from, for example, theft). Physical inventory is maintained through a combination of full location counts (typically once per year) and more regular cycle counts. 
Property and Equipment
 
Property and equipment is recorded at 
cost. We depreciate property and equipment to its residual value using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in serv
ice to the end of the lease term, which includes optional renewal periods if they are reasonably certain. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used for income tax purposes. 
When property is retired or othe
rwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
Repairs and maintenance costs a
re expensed as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated. 
Costs associated with the a
cquisition or development of software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software, generally from two year s to five years. A subsequent addition, modifi cation or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software's funct
ionality. Capitalized software is included in Fixtures and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period incurred. The costs of developing software for sale to customers is expensed as incurred 
until technological feasibility is established, which generally leads to expensing substantially all costs. 
Estimated useful lives by major 
asset category are as follows (in years): 
 
 
 Asset Category
Useful Life Buildings
5 -35Leasehold improvements
2 -10Fixtures and equipment
2 -15 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
Long-lived assets are evaluated fo
r impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future ca
sh flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value, which is typically based on e
stimated discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. 
We evaluate locations for tr
iggering events on a quarterly basis. For store locations, our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is negative store operating income for the most recent 12-month period. We also monitor other factors when evaluating store locations for impair
ment, including significant changes in the manner of use or expected life of the assets or significant changes in our business strategies. 
When reviewing long-lived assets f
or impairment, we group long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For example, long-lived assets deployed at store locations are reviewed for impai
rment at the individual store level, which involves comparing the net carrying value of all assets to the net cash flow projections for each store. In addition, we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate, for example, to evaluate potential impairment of assets shared by 
several areas of operations, such as information technology systems.  
48

Leases 
The majority of our lease obl
igations are real estate operating leases used in our retail and distribution operations. Our finance leases are primarily equipment-related. For any lease with an initial term in excess of 12 months, the related lease assets and liabilities are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets a
s either operating or finance leases at the inception of an agreement where it is determined that a lease exists. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Accounting Standard’s 
Codification 842, Leases , in fiscal 2020, we have ele cted to combine lease and non-lease components for all classes of assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. 
Operating lease assets represent the r
ight to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. These assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future payments over the lease term at the commencement date. We est
imate the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on an evaluation of our credit ratings and the prevailing market rates for collateralized debt in a similar economic environment with similar payment terms and maturity dates commensurate with the terms of the 
lease. Our operating leases also typically require payment of real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These components comprise the majority of our variable lease cost and are excluded from the present value of our lease obligations. In instances 
where they are fixed, they are included due to our election to combine lease and non-lease components. Operating lease assets also include prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs and are reduced by lease incentives. Our lease terms generally do not include options to extend or term
inate the lease unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Fixed payments may contain predetermined fixed rent escalations. We recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.
 
Goodwill and Intangible
 Assets  
Goodwill
 
Goodwill is the exce
ss of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We monitor the existence of potential 
impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are determined by identifying components of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is avai
lable and is regularly reviewed by segment management. No components were aggregated in arriving at our reporting units. We have goodwill in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health – with carrying values of $444  million and $542  million, respectively, as of January 30, 2021.
 
Our detailed impairment t
esting involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction and typically requires analysis of discounted cash f
lows and other market information, such as trading multiples and other observable metrics. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, 
we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
Intangible Assets
 
Our valuation of identifiab
le intangible assets acquired is based on information and assumptions available to us at the time of acquisition, using income and market approaches to determine fair value, as appropriate. 
We amortize our definite-
lived intangible assets over the estimated useful life of the asset. We review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable and monitor for the existence of potential impairment ind
icators throughout the fiscal year. We record an impairment loss for any portion of the carrying value that is not recoverable. 
Derivatives
 
Net Investment Hedges
 
We use foreign exchange forward cont
racts to hedge against the effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of our net investment in our Canadian operations. The contracts have terms of up to 12 months. For a net investment hedge, we recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative as a component of fo
reign currency translation within other comprehensive income to offset a portion of the change in translated value of the net investment being hedged, until the investment is sold or liquidated. We limit recognition in net earnings of amounts previously recorded in othe
r comprehensive income to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. We report the gains and losses, if any, related to the amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness in net earnings.
 
49

 Interest Rate Swaps
 
We utilized "receive fixed-rate, 
pay variable-rate" interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our $ 650  million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (“2021 Notes”) prior to their retirement in December 2020, and on our $500  million principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”)
. Our interest rate swap contracts a re considered perfect hedges because the critical terms and notional amounts match those of our fixed-rate debt being hedged and are, therefore, accounted for as fair value hedges using the shortcut method. Under the shortcut method, we recogni
ze the change in the fair value of the derivatives with an offsetting change to the carrying value of the debt. Accordingly, there is no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings from the fair value of the derivatives. 
Derivatives Not Designated as Hed
ging Instruments 
We use foreign currency for
ward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized receivable and payable balances denominated in non-functional currencies. The contracts generally have terms of up to 12 months. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedg
ing relationships and, therefore, we record gains and losses on these contracts directly to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
Fair Value
 
Fair value is the price that 
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, we use a three-tier valuation hiera
rchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs: 
Level 1
 — Unadjusted quote d prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
Level 2
 — Significant other observab le inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly, including: 
•
 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;•
 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets;•
 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and•
 Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data. 
Level 3
 — Significant unobservab le inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates of market participant assumptions.
 
The fair value hierarchy requ
ires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair va
lue measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. 
Assets and liabil
ities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to our tangible fixed assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are remeasured when the derived fair value is below carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For these assets, we do not periodically ad
just carrying value to fair value, except in the event of impairment. When we determine that impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value and the difference is recorded within SG&A and Restructuring charges on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for non-restru
cturing and restructuring charges, respectively. 
Fair value remeasurements are ba
sed on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fixed asset fair values are primarily derived using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model to estimate the present value of net cash flows that the asset or asset group was expected to generate. The key inputs to the DCF model general
ly include our forecasts of net cash generated from revenue, expenses and other significant cash outflows, such as capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate. 
Insurance
 
We are self-insured for cer
tain losses related to workers' compensation, medical and general liability claims; however, we obtain third-party excess insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain claims. Some of these self-insured losses are managed through a wholly-owned insurance captive. Liabilities associated with 
these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We utilize valuations provided by qualified, independent third-party actuaries as well as internal insurance and risk expertise. Our self-insured liabilities included on our Consolidated Balance S
heets were as follows ($ in millions): 
             
        
January 30, 2021  February 1, 2020 Accrued liabilities
$  101  $  75 Long-term liabilities
  45     46  Total
$  146  $  121  
50

Income Taxes 
We account for income taxes us
ing the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operat
ing loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. 
In determining our provis
ion for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. The effective income tax rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits. We adjust our annual effect
ive income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. Discrete events, such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws, are recognized in the period in which they occur. 
Our income tax returns are period
ically audited by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign taxing authorities. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures.
 A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effective
ly settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. We include our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, in Long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet
s and in Income tax expense on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
Accrued Liabilities
 
The major components
 of accrued liabilities are sales tax liabilities, advertising accruals, sales return reserves, customer deposits and insurance liabilities. 
Long-Term Liabilities
 
The major components
 of long-term liabilities are unrecognized tax benefits, income tax liabilities and self-insurance reserves. 
Foreign Currency
 
Foreign currency denominated asset
s and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at our Consolidated Balance Sheet dates. For operations reported on a one-month lag, we use the exchange rates in effect one month prior to our Consolidated Balance Sheet dates. Results of operations and ca
sh flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the periods. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gain
s and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are included in SG&A, have not been significant in any period presented. 
Revenue Recognition
 
We generate revenue from the sale of products and 
services, both as a principal and as an agent. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or servi
ces. Our revenue excludes sales and usage-based taxes collected and is reported net of sales refunds, which includes an estimate of future returns and contract cancellations based on historical refund rates, with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales. We defer the revenue assoc
iated with any unsatisfied performance obligation until the obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of a product is transferred to the customer or a service is completed. 
Product Revenue
 
Product revenue is recognized 
when the customer takes physical control, either in our stores or at their home. Any fees charged to customers for delivery are a component of the transaction price and are recognized when delivery has been completed. We use delivery information at an individual contract 
level to determine when to recognize revenue for delivered products and any related delivery fee revenue. 
In most cases, we are the princ
ipal to product contracts as we have control of the physical products prior to transfer to the customer. Accordingly, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. For certain sales, primarily activation-based software licenses and third-party stored-value cards, we are the sales agent providing acce
ss to the content and recognize commission revenue net of amounts due to third parties who fulfill the performance obligation. For these sales, control passes upon providing access of the content to the customer. 
Warranty obligations as
sociated with the sale of our exclusive brands products are assurance-type warranties that are a guarantee of the product’s intended functionality and, therefore, do not represent a distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract.

 Services - When we are the
 principal 
We recognize revenue for serv
ices, such as installation, set-up, software troubleshooting, product repair, consultation and educational classes once the service is completed, as this is when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits of the service or serviced product. Payment terms are typica
lly at the point of sale, but may also occur upon completion of the service. Our service contracts are primarily with retail customers and merchandise vendors (for factory warranty repairs). 
For technical support membersh
ip contracts (for example, our Total Tech Support offering), we are responsible for fulfilling the support services to customers. These contracts have terms ranging from one month  to three years and typically contain sever al performance obligations. Payment for the membership contracts i
s due at the start of the contract period. We have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our payment terms is to provide customers with a simplified method of purchasing our services, not to provide customers with f
inancing. For performance obligations provided over time, we recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This method is derived by analysis of historical utilization patterns as this depicts when customers use the services and, a
ccordingly, when delivery of the performance obligation occurs. There is judgment in (1) determining the level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts; (2) measuring the relative standalone selling price for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that they are only bundled and 
sold to customers with other performance obligations, or alternatively, using a cost-plus margin approach; and (3) assessing the pattern of delivery across multiple portfolios of customers, including estimating current and future usage patterns. When insufficient h
istory is available to estimate usage, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract. 
Services - When we are the agent
 
On behalf of third-party underwr
iters, we sell various hardware protection plans to customers that provide extended warranty coverage on their device purchases. Such plans have terms ranging from one month  to five years. Payment is due at the point of sale. Th ird-party underwriters assume the risk associated 
with the coverage and are primarily responsible for fulfillment. We record the net commissions (the amount charged to the customer less the premiums remitted to the underwriter) as revenue at a point in time when the corresponding product revenue is recognized. In addition, in some 
cases we are eligible to receive profit-sharing payments, a form of variable consideration, which are dependent upon the financial performance of the underwriter’s protection plan portfolio. We do not share in any losses of the portfolio. We record any profit share as revenue once the uncertainty asso
ciated with the portfolio period, which is calendar-year based, is no longer constrained using the expected value method. This typically occurs during our fiscal fourth quarter, with payment of the profit share occurring in the subsequent fiscal year. Service and commiss
ion revenues earned from the sale of extended warranties represented approximately 2 % of revenue in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. 
We earn commissions f
rom mobile network carriers to sell service contracts on their platforms. Revenue is recognized when control passes at a point in time upon sale of the contract and activation of the customer on the provider’s platform. The time between when we activate the service with the customer and when we re
ceive payment from the content provider is generally within 30 to 60 days, which is after control has passed. Activation commissions are subject to repayment to the carrier primarily in the event of customer cancellation for specified time periods after the sale. Commission revenue from m
obile network carriers is reported net of the expected cancellations, which we estimate based on historical cancellation rates. 
Credit Card Revenue
 
We offer promotional financ
ing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Approximately 25 % of revenue in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was transacted using one of our branded cards. We provide a license to our brand and marketing services, and 
we facilitate credit applications in our stores and online. The banks are the sole owners of the accounts receivable generated under the program and, accordingly, we do not hold any customer receivables related to these programs and act as an agent in the financing transactions w
ith customers. We are eligible to receive a profit share from certain of our banking partners based on the annual performance of their corresponding portfolio, and we receive quarterly payments based on forecasts of full-year performance. This is a form of variable consideration. We record su
ch profit share as revenue over time using the most likely amount method, which reflects the amount earned each quarter when it is determined that the likelihood of a significant revenue reversal is not probable, which is typically quarterly. Profit-share payments occur quarterly, shortly afte
r the end of each program quarter. 
Best Buy Gift Cards
 
We sell Best Buy gift 
cards to our customers in our retail stores, online and through select third parties. Our gift cards do not expire. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer. We also recognize revenue for the portion of gift card values that is not expected to be redeemed ("breakage"). We est
imate breakage based on historical patterns and other factors, such as laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction. We recognize breakage revenue using a method that is consistent with customer redemption patterns. Typically, over 
90 % of gift card redemptions (and therefore recognition of over 90 % of gift card breakage revenue) occur within one year of issuance. There is judgment in assessing (1) the level at which we group gift cards for analysis of breakage rates, (2) redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate value of gift cards which 
we do not expect to be redeemed. Gift card breakage income was $33  million, $35  million and $34  million in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. 
52

 Sales Incentives
 
We frequently offer sales in
centives that entitle our customers to receive a gift card at the time of purchase or an instant savings coupon that can be redeemed towards a future purchase. For sales incentives issued to customers that are only earned in conjunction with the purchase of products or services, the sa
les incentives represent an option that is a material right and, accordingly, is a performance obligation in the contract. The revenue allocated to these sales incentives is deferred as a contract liability and is based on the cards that are projected to be redeemed. We recognize revenue for this pe
rformance obligation when it is redeemed by the customer or when it is not expected to be redeemed. There is judgment in determining (1) the level at which we group incentives based on similar redemption patterns, (2) future redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate number of incentive
s that we do not expect to be redeemed. 
We also issue coupons that are not earned 
in conjunction with a purchase of a product or service, typically as part of targeted marketing activities. This is not a performance obligation, but is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price when redeemed by the customer. 
Customer Loyalty Programs
 
We have customer loyalty p
rograms which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed with us or when using our co-branded credit cards. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases. Depending on the customer's membership level within our loyalty pr
ogram, certificate expirations typically range from 2  to 6 months from the date of issuance. Our loyalty programs represent customer options that provide a material right and, accordingly, are performance obligations for each applicable contract. The relative standalone sel
ling price of points earned by our loyalty program members is deferred and included in Deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the percentage of points that are projected to be redeemed. We recognize revenue for this performance obligation over time when a certifi
cate is estimated to be redeemed by the customer. There is inherent judgment in estimating the value of our customer loyalty programs as they are susceptible to factors outside of our influence, particularly customer redemption activity. However, we have significant experience in estimating the a
mount and timing of redemptions of certificates, based primarily on historical data. 
Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administ
rative Expenses 
The following tables illustrate 
the primary costs classified in each major expense category. 
Cost of Sales
Cost of products sold, including:
Freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our vendors to our distribution centers
Vendor allowances that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs
Cash discounts on payments to merchandise vendors
Physical inventory losses
Markdowns
Customer shipping and handling expenses
Costs associated with operating our distribution network, including payroll and benefit costs, occupancy costs and depreciation
Freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our distribution centers to our retail stores
Cost of services provided, including:
Payroll and benefit costs for services employees associated with providing the service
Cost of replacement parts and related freight expenses
 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Payroll and benefit costs for retail and corporate employees
Occupancy and maintenance costs of retail, services and corporate facilities
Depreciation and amortization related to retail, services and corporate assets
Advertising costs
Vendor allowances that are a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs
Tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees
Charitable contributions
Outside and outsourced service fees
Long-lived asset impairment charges
Other administrative costs, such as supplies, travel and lodging
 
Vendor Allowances
 
We receive funds from our mer
chandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements for product advertising and product placement, primarily in the form of allowances based on purchases or sales volumes. We recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the as
sociated inventory is sold. Allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. Funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs in
curred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related expense when incurred. 
53

Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs, which are includ
ed in SG&A, are expensed over the period in which the advertisement is customer-facing. Advertising costs consist primarily of digital and television advertisements, as well as support costs. Advertising expenses were $819  million, $840  million and $777  million in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 
and fiscal 2019, respectively. 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
We apply the fair value recogn
ition provisions of accounting guidance as they relate to our stock-based compensation, which requires us to recognize expense for the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the period in which services are required. It 
is recognized on a straight-line basis, except where there are performance awards that vest on a graded basis, in which case the expense for these awards is front-loaded or recognized on a graded-attribution basis. 
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
 
Comprehensive income (
loss) is computed as net earnings plus certain other items that are recorded directly to shareholders' equity. In addition to net earnings, the significant component of comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments. 
2.   Restructuring

Mexico Exit and Strategic Realignm
ent 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had s
ignificant impacts on, for example, the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate, customer shopping behaviors, the role of technology in peoples’ lives and the way we meet their needs. In light of these changes, we are adapting our Building the New B
lue Strategy to ensure that our focus and resources are closely aligned with the opportunities we see in front of us. As a result, in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we made the decision to exit our operations in Mexico and began taking other actions to more broadly align our organizational structure 
in support of our strategy.  
Charges incurred in our Internat
ional segment primarily related to our decision to exit our operations in Mexico. As of January 30, 2021, the exit was substantially complete and we do not expect to incur material future restructuring charges. 
Charges incurred in our 
Domestic segment primarily related to actions taken to align our organizational structure in support of our strategy. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we incurred $46  million of restructuring charges primarily related to termination benefits associated with corporate organizational changes, a
s well as impairments of technology assets held in service of our Mexico operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we incurred $87  million of restructuring charges related to termination benefits primarily for field employees in order to be more responsive and flexible 
with our workforce as we continue to refine our operating model to better serve our customers’ needs. 
As we continue to evolve our Bu
ilding the New Blue Strategy, it is possible that we will incur material future restructuring costs, but we are unable to forecast the timing and magnitude of such costs. 
All charges incurred related 
to the exit from Mexico and strategic realignment described above were from continuing operations and were presented as follows ($ in millions):

Fiscal 2020 U.S. Retail Opera
ting Model Changes 
In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we made 
changes primarily related to our U.S. retail operating model to increase organization effectiveness and create a more seamless customer experience across all channels. All charges incurred, including $10  million related to a voluntary early retirement offer, related to terminat
ion benefits within our Domestic segment and were presented within Restructuring charges from continuing operations on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of January 30, 2021, the cumulative amount of charges incurred was $41  million and no
 material liability remains. 
Best Buy Mobile Exit
 
On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close a
ll of our 257  remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. This decision was a result of changing economics in the mobile industry since we began opening these stores in 2006, along with the integration of our mobile model into our core stores and onl
ine channel, which are more economically compelling today. The cumulative amount of charges incurred was $56  million, comprised of $49  million of facility closure and other costs, $6  million of termination benefits and $1  million of asset impairments. All  charges incurred related to our 
Domestic segment and were presented within Restructuring charges from continuing operations on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. No restructuring accrua l related to this plan remains as of January 30, 2021.  
3.   Acquisitions
 
BioSensics, LLC
 
In fiscal 2020 we acquired the pred
ictive healthcare technology business of BioSensics, LLC (“BioSensics”) on August 7, 2019, for net cash consideration of $20  million, primarily comprised of $19  million of goodwill and $4  million of definite-lived technology (amortized over 3  years). Goodwill, which 
was assigned to our Domestic reporting unit, is deductible for tax purposes. The acquisition currently supports our health strategy and is included in our Domestic operating and reportable segments. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and was not material to the results of our operat
ions. 
Critical Signal Technologies, Inc.
 
In fiscal 2020 we acquired a
ll of the outstanding shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”), a health services company, on May 9, 2019, for net cash consideration of $125  million. The acquisition of CST is aligned with our strategy to address health and wellness with a focus on aging
 seniors and how tech nology can help them live longer in their homes. 
The acquisition was accounted fo
r using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquired assets were primarily comprised of $83  million of customer relationships (amortized over 15  years) recorded within Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill of $
52  million was recorded and assigned to our Best Buy Health reporting unit and was not deductible for income tax purposes. We recorded $3  million of transaction costs in fiscal 2020 related to the acquisition within SG&A expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Results of operat
ions from the date of acquisition were included within our Best Buy Heath operating segment, Domestic reportable segment and Services revenue category. The acquisition of CST was not material to the results of our operations. 
GreatCall, Inc.
 
In fiscal 2019 we acquired a
ll of the outstanding shares of GreatCall, Inc. (“GreatCall”) on October 1, 2018, for net cash consideration of $787  million. GreatCall, a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers, offers easy-to-use mobile products and connected devices, tailored for seniors. These produ
cts are combined with a range of services, including a simple, one-touch connection to U.S.-based, specially-trained agents who can connect the user to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel. The acquisition of GreatCall is aligned with our stra
tegic focus on health and wellness. 
The acquisition was accounted fo
r using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Goodwill of $490  million was recorded and assigned to our Best Buy Health reporting  unit within our Domestic reportable segmen t, the majority of which was deductible for income tax purposes. We recorded $
13  million of transaction costs in fiscal 2019 related to the acquisition within SG&A expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Results of operations from the date of acquisition were included within our Best Buy Health operating segment, Domestic reportable segment and Services 
revenue category. The acquisition of GreatCall was not material to the results of our operations.

Indefinite-Lived Inta

In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, 
we made the decision to phase out our Pacific Sales tradename in our U.S. Best Buy stores over the coming years. Consequently, we reclassified the tradename from an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset and have no indefinite-lived 
intangible assets remaining as of January 30, 2021. The carrying value of the tradename was $18  million as of February 1, 2020, and was recorded within Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

5.   Fair Value Measurements 
Fair value measurements are repo
rted in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable mar
ket data).

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measur
ements 
In fiscal 2021 we recorded asset 
impairments related to our decision to exit our operations in Mexico. See Note 2, Restructuring , for additional information regarding the charges incurred and the net carrying value of assets remaining. 
Fair Value of Financial Ins
truments 
The fair values of cash, recei
vables, accounts payable, short-term debt and other payables approximated their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. If these instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, they would be classified as Level 1 in the fair value hie
rarchy. Fair values for other investments held at cost are not readily available, but we estimate that the carrying values for these investments approximate their fair values.  
Long-term debt is presented at carry
ing value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. If our long-term debt was recorded at fair value, it would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Long-term debt balances were as follows ($ in millions):

6.   Derivative Instruments
 
We manage our economic and transact
ion exposure to certain risks by using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of our net investment in our Canadian operations, and interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our 2021 
Notes prior to their retirement in December 2020 and on our 2028 Notes. In addition, we use foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized rece
ivable and payable balances denominated in non-functional currencies. 
In fiscal 2021 we entered into Treasu
ry Rate Lock (“T-Lock”) contracts to hedge the base interest rate variability on a portion of our then-expected refinancing of our maturing 2021 Notes. The T-Lock contracts were cash settled upon issuance of our 2030 Notes. The fair value of the T-Lock contracts upon settlement was re
leased from Accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded in Interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as interest is accrued over the life of the 2030 Notes. 
Our derivative instrument
s designated as net investment hedges and interest rate swaps are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. See Note 5, Fair Value Measurements , for gross fair values of our outstand ing derivative instruments and corresponding fair value classifications.

8.   Debt
 
Short-Term Debt
 
U.S. Revolving Credit Facility
 
On April 17, 2018, we entered into a $
1.25  billion five year  senior unsecured revolving  credit facility agreement (the "Facility") with a syndicate of banks. The Facility permits borrowings of up to $1.25  billion and expires in April 2023. In light of the uncertainty surround ing the impact of COVID-19 and to maximi
ze liquidity, we executed a short-term draw on the full amount of the Facility on March 19, 2020, which remained outstanding until July 27, 2020, when the amounts we had borrowed under the Facility were repaid in full. There were no  borrowings outstanding under  the Facility as of January 30, 2021, and Februa
ry 1, 2020.  
The interest rate under the Facilit
y is variable and, barring certain events of default, is determined at our option as: (i) the sum of (a) the greatest of (1) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate; (2) the greater of the federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate plus, in each case, 
0.5 %; and (3) the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), subject to certain adjustments plus 1 %; and (b) a variable margin rate (the “ABR Margin”); or (ii) the LIBOR plus a variable margin rate (the “LIBOR Margin”). In addition, a facility fee is assessed on the commitment amount. The ABR Marg
in, LIBOR Margin and the facility fee are based upon our current senior unsecured debt rating. Under the Facility, the ABR Margin ranges from 0.00 % to 0.30 %, the LIBOR Margin ranges from 0.80 % to 1.30 % and the facility fee ranges from 
0.08 % to 0.20 %. 
The Facility is guaranteed by 
certain of our subsidiaries and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens on certain assets; make material changes in corporate structure or the nature of our business; dispose of mater
ial assets; engage in certain mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes; or engage in certain transactions with our affiliates. The Facility also contains covenants that require us to maintain a maximum quarterly cash flow leverage ratio and a minimum quarterly 
interest coverage ratio. The Facility contains default provisions including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply with covenants. As of January 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

 2021 Notes
 
In March 2011 we issued $
650  million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). The 2021 Notes bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.50 % per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2011. The 2021 Notes were issued at a slight disco
unt to par, which when coupled with underwriting discounts of $4  million, resulted in net proceeds from the sale of the 2021 Notes of $644  million. We retired the 2021 Notes in December 2020 by exercising our option to redeem the notes at par. 
2028 Notes
 
In September 2018 we issued $
500  million principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (the “2028 Notes”). The 2028 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.45 % per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2019. Net proceeds from the issuance were $
495  million after underwriting and issuance discounts totaling $5  million. 
We may redeem some or all of the 2028 
Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 % of the principal amount, and (ii) the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid 
interest on the principal amount to the redemption date as described in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the 2028 Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unredeemed 2028 Notes at a pr
ice equal to 101 % of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. 
The 2028 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obl
igations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The 2028 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens or to enter into sale and lease-back transactions.
 
2030 Notes
 
In October 2020 we issued $
650  million principal amount of notes due October 1, 2030, (the “2030 Notes”) that bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.95 % per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2021. Net proceeds from the issuance were $
642  million after underwriting and issuance discounts totaling $8  million. The net proceeds were used to replace the 2021 Notes that were retired in December 2020. 
We may redeem some or all of the 2030 
Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 % of the principal amount, and (ii) the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid 
interest on the principal amount to the redemption date as described in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the 2030 Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unredeemed 2030 Notes at a pr
ice equal to 101 % of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. 
The 2030 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obl
igations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The 2030 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens or to enter into sale and lease-back transactions.
 
Fair Value and Future Maturities
 
See Note 5, 
Fair Value Measurements , for the fair value of long-term debt.  
As of January 30, 2021, we do 
no t have any future maturities of long-term debt within the next five fiscal years.  
9.   Shareholders' Equity
 
Stock Compensation Plans
 
The Best Buy Co., Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incent
ive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) approved by shareholders in June 2020 authorizes us to issue up to 18.6  million shares plus the remaining unused shares available for issuance under the Best Buy Co., Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”
). In addition, shares subject to any outstanding awards under our prior stock incentive plans that are forfeited, cancelled or reacquired by the Company will become available for reissuance under the 2020 Plan. The 2014 Plan was terminated as to the grant of any additional awards, but pr
ior awards remain outstanding and continue to vest in accordance with the original terms of such plan. 
The 2020 Plan authorizes us to grant or i
ssue non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other equity awards. We have not granted incentive stock options. Under the terms of the 2020 Plan, awards may be granted to our employees, officers, adv
isers, consultants and directors. Awards issued under the 2020 Plan vest as determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors at the time of grant. As of January 30, 2021, a total of 22.3  million shares were available for future grants under the 2020 P
lan.

 Our outstanding stock options have a 
10 -year term. Outstanding stock options issued to employees generally vest over a three year  period. Share awards vest based e ither upon attainment of specified goals or solely upon continued employment ("time-based"). Outstanding share awards that are not time-based vest at the end of a three-year 
incentive period based upon our total shareholder return ("TSR") compared to the TSR of companies that comprise Standard & Poor's 500 Index ("market-based") or upon the achievement of company performance goals ("performance-based"). 
Generally, time-based share awards vest 33 % on each of the three annual anniversary dates following the grant date. Time-based share awards to directors vest one year  from the grant date.

Earnings per Share
 
We compute our basic earnings pe
r share based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, and our diluted earnings per share based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially di
lutive common shares been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include stock options and non-vested share awards. Non-vested market-based share awards and non-vested performance-based share awards are included in the average diluted shares outstanding each period if establ
ished market or performance criteria have been met at the end of the respective periods.

Repurchase of Common Stock
 
On February 23, 2019, our Board of Director
s (“Board”) authorized a $3.0  billion share repurchase program. On February 16, 2021, our Board approved a new $5.0  billion share repurchase program, replacing the existing program which had $1.7  billion remaining available for repurchases as of January 30, 2021. There is no expirat
ion date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization. We temporarily suspended all share repurchases from March to November of fiscal 2021 to conserve liquidity in light of COVID-19-related uncertainties. 
Repurchased shares have been retired and 
constitute authorized but unissued shares. Information regarding the shares we repurchased and retired was as follows ($ and shares in millions, except per share amounts):

Tax Reform
 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. Among other things, the Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35 % to 21 % effective January 1, 2018, broadened the base to which U.S. income tax applies, imposed a one-time deemed repatriat
ion tax on net unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries not previously subject to U.S. income tax and changed how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. income tax. 
In response to the Tax Act, the Securitie
s and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) which provided guidance on accounting for the impact of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts to the extent they were reasonably estimable and adju
st them over time as more information became available, not to extend beyond the measurement period of one year from the enactment of the Tax Act. During fiscal 2019, we completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded a $
23 million reduction to the fiscal 2018 provisional tax expense.

Deferred taxes were pres

  -     ( 29) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)
$  17  $  ( 20) 
As of January 30, 2021, we had deferred tax assets fo
r net operating loss carryforwards from international operations of $109  million, of which $103  million will expire in various years through 2038 and the remaining amounts have no expiration; acquired U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
9  million, of which $8  million will expire in various years between 2024 and 2037 and the remaining amounts have no expiration; U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $6  million, which expire between 2024 and 2031; state credit carryforwards of $5  million, which expire between 2023 and 2028; state net operating los
s carryforwards of $4  million, which expire between 2022 and 2040; international credit carryforwards of $2  million, which have no expiration; and international capital loss carryforwards of $8  million, which have no expiration. 
As of January 30, 2021, a valuation al
lowance of $127  million had been established, of which $6  million is against U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards, $8  million is against international capital loss carryforwards, $111  million is against international and state net operating loss carryforwards, and $
2  million is against international credit carryforwards. The $31  million increase in fiscal 2021 is primarily due to the current year loss activity from international net operating loss carryforwards, partially offset by the expiration of certain international net operating loss carryforwards, the release of a 
valuation allowance relating to other state deferred tax assets, and the exchange rate impact on the valuation allowance against certain international net operating loss carryforwards. 
Reconciliations of changes in 
unrecognized tax benefits were as follows ($ in millions): 
                     
            
2021  2020  2019 Balances at beginning of period
$  318   $  300   $  279  Gross increases related to prior period tax positions
  17     1     4  Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions
  ( 25)    ( 5)    ( 12) Gross increases related to current period tax positions

  ( 1)    -     ( 1) Lapse of statute of limitations
  ( 11)    ( 12)    ( 6) Balances at end of period
$  327   $  318   $  300   
Unrecognized tax benefits of $
307  million, $300  million and $282  million as of January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019, respectively, would favorably impact our effective income tax rate if recognized. 
We recognize interest and penalt
ies (not included in the "unrecognized tax benefits" above), as well as interest received from favorable tax settlements, as components of income tax expense. Interest expense of $4  million, $11  million and $10  million was recognized in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respective
ly. As of January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019, we had accrued interest of $74  million, $67  million and $53  million, respectively. 
We file a consolidated 
U.S. federal income tax return, as well as income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years before fiscal 2011.

Changes in state, federal and foreign tax 
laws may increase or decrease our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations and controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the a
mounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various taxing authorities or reach resolutions of income tax examinations or controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments, resolutions o
r law changes could result in changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits. The actual amount of any changes could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any assessments, resolutions or law changes. Although the timing is uncertain, it is reasonabl
y possible that within the next 12 months, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as $120  million. 
12.   Benefit Plans
 
We sponsor retirement sav
ings plans for employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Participants may choose from various investment options, including a fund comprised of our company stock. Participants can contribute up to 50 % of their eligible compensation annually as defined by the plan document, subject to Internal 
Revenue Service limitations. We match 100 % of the first 3 % of participating employees' contributions and 50 % of the next 2 %. Employer contributions vest immediately. In light of the uncertainty surround ing the impact of COVID-19 and to maximize liquidity, we temporarily suspende
d the employer contribution match f rom June 1, 2020, to November 6, 2020. Total employer contributions were $44  million, $73  million and $67  million in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. 
We offer a non-qualified, unfunded deferred co
mpensation plan for highly-compensated employees and members of our Board. Amounts contributed and deferred under the plan are invested in options offered under the plan and elected by the participants. The liability for compensation deferred under the plan was $
25  million and $22  million as of January 30, 2021, and February 1, 2020, respectively, and is included in Long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 5, Fair Value Measurements , for the fair value of assets held for defe rred compensation.
 
13.   Contingencies and Commitments
 
We are involved in a number of 
legal proceedings. Where appropriate, we have made accruals with respect to these matters, which are reflected on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there are cases where liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and, therefore, accruals have not been 
made. We provide disclosure of matters where we believe it is reasonably possible the impact may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
We had outstanding letters of credit 
with an aggregate fair value of $72  million as of January 30, 2021.

ition by the Company, termination or cancellation, shall again be available for granting Awards under the Plan.(ii)

 withheld by the Company or Shares tendered to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an Award; (C) Shares covered by a Stock Appreciation Right issued under the Plan that are not issued in connection withsettlement

 separation from service meet the definition of a change in ownership or effective control, disability, or separation from service, as the case may be, in Section 409A(a)(2)(A) of the Code and applicable proposed orfinal regulations, or (ii) the
 payment or distribution of such amount or benefit would be exempt from the application of Section 409A by reason of the short-term deferral exemption or otherwise. Any payment or distribution that otherwisewould be made to a

any
 benefits do not qualify for the foregoing exemptions, such benefits are intended to be exempt from Section 409A under the “involuntary separation pay plan” exception set forth in Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii),up
 to the maximum extent permitted by said provision (generally, two times the lesser of the Employee’s annualized compensation or the compensation limit then in effect under section 401(a)(17) of the Code). Benefits inexcess of the
 maximum shall be reduced or accelerated as necessary to avoid application of Section 409A (unless otherwise exempt). The term “Employment Termination” shall be interpreted to mean a “separation from service”as
 that term is defined under Section 409A to the extent necessary to qualify the arrangement as an involuntary separation arrangement. “Applicable 2-1/2 Month Period” means the period beginning upon the Employee’sEmployment
 Termination and ending 2 ½ months after the later of (i) the end of the calendar year in which the Employee’s Employment Termination occurred, or (ii) the end of the Company’s fiscal year in which theEmployee’s Employment Termination occurred.

 is denied, in whole or in part, the claimant will be notified in writing of the specific reason(s) for the denial and the Plan provision(s) on which the decision was based. The Benefits Committee’s decision onan appeal will be final and binding on all parties and persons affected. If a claimant is not notified within the 60-day (or 120-day, if so extended) period, the claimant may consider the appeal to be denied.
