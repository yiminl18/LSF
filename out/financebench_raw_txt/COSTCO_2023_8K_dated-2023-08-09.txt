ARTICLE 2
SHAREHOLDERS
2.1 ANNUAL MEETING.
(a) The annual meeting of shareholders shall be held each year at such date, time and place as may be designated by
resolution of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting may be held solely by means

meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days before or delayed by more
than 30 days after the anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, or if

the corporation did not hold an annual meeting in the preceding year, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than
the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day before such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day
on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. The minimum timeliness requirements of this paragraph shall apply

understanding, a “Derivative Instrument”);
(D) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or other business
between or among such Holder or control person, on the one hand, and any other person acting in concert with any of them, on

(E) a description of the terms of and number of shares subject to any short interest in any security of the corporation

otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security);

participant in a solicitation with such Holder or control person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or
other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election
of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;
(J) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of the stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such
meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to present such business or nomination and to vote or cause
to be voted its stock at the meeting;
(K) a description of such Holder’s direct or, to the Holder’s knowledge, indirect interest in any contract with the
corporation or any affiliate of the corporation (including any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement or
consulting agreement);
(L) a complete and accurate description of any pending or, to the Holder’s knowledge, threatened legal proceeding
in which such Holder is a party or participant involving the corporation or, to the Holder’s knowledge, any current or former

The information required by this subsection (i) shall be provided as of the date of the notice and shall be provided as of the record date

(B) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements,
and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among the Holder and any
control person or other person acting in concert, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and each proposed nominee’s
respective affiliates or persons acting in concert, on the other hand, including, without limitation, all information that would be
required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K if the Holder making the nomination
- 3 -
and any affiliate or person acting in concert with either, were the “registrant” for purposes of Item 404 and the nominee were a
director or executive officer of such registrant;
(C) a description of the material terms of all agreements and arrangements between any nominee and any person
or entity other than the corporation relating to compensation or other payment in connection with such nominee’s candidacy or, if
elected, service as a director;

(F) such other information as the corporation may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed

law and rules.
(iii) as to any other business that the Holder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such
business, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and, in the event such
business includes a proposal to amend the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, the text of such amended Articles or
Bylaws), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such Holder.
(e) In no event may a Holder nominate a greater number of nominees than are subject to election by the shareholders at
the applicable meeting. Any Holders directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other shareholders must use a proxy card color other than white,
which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.1 to the contrary, in the event
that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees
for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the corporation at least 55 days before the first anniversary of the
date of the preceding year’s annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder’s notice required by this Bylaw shall also be considered timely, but
only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made
by the corporation.
(f) Section 2.1(b)(iii) and Section 2.12 shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make director nominations at an
annual meeting of shareholders and Section 2.1(b)(iii) shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to submit other business at an annual
meeting of shareholders (other than proposals that are brought under Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act (or any successor rule) and included in
the corporation’s notice of meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any
business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any
proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such defectively proposed business or nomination shall
not be presented for shareholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.1, unless
otherwise required by law, if any Holder directly or indirectly (i) provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) of the Exchange Act and (ii)
subsequently fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(2) and Rule 14a-19(a)(3) of the Exchange Act (including because such
shareholder fails to provide the Company with all information and notices required by Rule 14a-19 of the Exchange Act and this Section 2.1),
then any person nominated by such Holder shall be ineligible for election and the chairman of the meeting shall disregard any proxies or votes
solicited for each person whom the Holder nominates, notwithstanding that such
- 4 -
proxies may have been received by the corporation and counted for the purposes of determining quorum. If any Holder directly or indirectly
provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) of the Exchange Act, such shareholder shall deliver to the Company reasonable evidence that it has
met the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(3) of the Exchange Act no later than 5 business days prior to the applicable meeting.
(g) For purposes of these Bylaws, (i) “control person” means, with respect to a Holder, each director (in the case of a
corporation), general partner (in the case of a limited or general partnership), manager or managing member (in the case of a limited liability
company), executive officer, or other person performing similar functions of such Holder or such Holder’s general partner, manager or managing
member (each, a “control person”), and (ii) “public announcement” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News
Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(h) Nothing in this Section 2.1 shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the
corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Notice of shareholder proposals that are, or that the shareholder
intends to be, governed by Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act are not governed by this Section 2.1.
2.2 SPECIAL MEETINGS.
(a) Special meetings of the shareholders, other than those required by statute, may be called at any time by the Board of
Directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board, or by any shareholders of record owning in the aggregate at
least 10% of all votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed special meeting. For purposes of this
Section 2.2, the term “Whole Board” shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously
authorized directorships. The Board of Directors may postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting.
(b) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of the shareholders as shall have been brought before the
meeting pursuant to the corporation’s notice of the meeting. In the case of a special meeting called by one or more shareholders, the business
transacted shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the request; provided that the Board of Directors may submit its own proposal or proposals
for consideration at such special meeting.
(c) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the
shareholders may be made at a special meeting of shareholders only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any shareholder
of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the
notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2. Nominations by shareholders of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of
business by shareholders may be made at such a special meeting of shareholders if the substance of the shareholder’s notice complies with
Section 2.1, and the shareholder’s notice has been delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than
the close of business on the later of the 90th day before such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is
first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.
(d) Section 2.2(c)(ii) shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make director nominations or submit other business
at a special meeting of shareholders (other than proposals that are brought under Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act and included in the
corporation’s notice of meeting). The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any
business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any
proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such defectively proposed business or nomination shall
not be presented for shareholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded.
- 5 -
(e) Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the
corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Notice of shareholder proposals that are, or that the shareholder
intends to be, governed by Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act are not governed by this Section 2.2.
2.3 NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Except as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) below, all notices of meetings of shareholders shall be
sent not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting and
(a) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted (no business other than that specified in the notice may
be transacted) or (b) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the Board of Directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to
present for action by the shareholders (but, subject to the provisions of the next paragraph of this Section 2.3 and the advance notice provisions
of Section 2.1(b) and 2.12, any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action). The notice of any meeting at which directors are
to be elected shall include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, are intended by the Board of Directors to be
presented for election.
Written notice of any meeting of shareholders shall be given either (a) personally, (b) by first-class mail, (c) by other written means of
communication, or (d) by electronic transmission (as defined below) either by the corporation (if the meeting is called by the Board of Directors)
or to the corporation (if the meeting is called by a shareholder pursuant to Section 2.2).
“Electronic transmission by the corporation” includes facsimile transmissions, electronic mail, posting on an electronic message board or
network which the corporation has designated for such purpose (together with a separate notice to the shareholder of the posting), or
other means of electronic communication, provided such electronic transmission (i) creates a record that is capable of retention, retrieval
and review and may otherwise be rendered into clearly legible tangible form and (ii) complies, to the extent applicable, with the
Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001(c)(1)). The corporation may not send notices by
electronic transmission to a shareholder unless such shareholder has affirmatively consented to receiving notices by electronic
transmission; such shareholder may revoke such consent at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice shall not be given by
electronic transmission to a shareholder if the corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive notices to such shareholder by that
means, or the inability to deliver notices electronically to such shareholder becomes known to the Secretary, assistant secretary or
transfer agent of the corporation, or to any other person responsible for the giving of the notice.
“Electronic transmission to the corporation” includes facsimile or electronic mail directed to the facsimile number or electronic mail
address specified by the corporation for such purpose, posting on an electronic message board or network which the corporation has
designated for such purpose, or other means of electronic communication, provided that the corporation has put into effect reasonable
measures to verify that the sender is the shareholder purporting to send the message, and provided further that such electronic
transmission creates a record capable of retention, retrieval and review, and may thereafter be rendered into clearly legible tangible
form.
Notices sent by the corporation by mail, facsimile or electronic mail shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the
shareholder at the mailing, facsimile or electronic mail address of that shareholder, as applicable, appearing on the books of the corporation or
given by the shareholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice. If no address appears on the corporation’s books or is given, notice shall
be deemed to have been given if sent to that shareholder by mail or other written communication to the corporation’s principal executive office,
or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where that office is located.
Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the mail or sent by other means of
written communication or electronic transmission. If notice is sent via posting on an electronic message board together with a separate notice to
the shareholder of the posting,
- 6 -
notice shall be deemed to have been validly delivered upon the later of the posting or the delivery of the separate notice.
(a) NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING. In the case of a special meeting, the written notice shall also state with reasonable
clarity the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and the actions sought to be approved at the meeting. No business other than
that specified in the notice may be transacted at a special meeting.
(b) PROPOSED ARTICLES OF AMENDMENT OR DISSOLUTION. If the business to be conducted at any meeting
includes any proposed amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or the proposed voluntary dissolution of the corporation, then the written
notice shall be given not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the meeting date and shall state that the purpose or one of the purposes is
to consider the advisability thereof, and, in the case of a proposed amendment, shall be accompanied by a copy of the amendment.
(c) PROPOSED MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, EXCHANGE, SALE, LEASE OR DISPOSITION. If the business to be
conducted at any meeting includes any proposed plan of merger or share exchange, or any sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the corporation’s property otherwise than in the usual or regular course of its business, then the written notice shall state that
the purpose or one of the purposes is to consider the proposed plan of merger or share exchange, sale, lease, or disposition, as the case may
be, shall describe the proposed action with reasonable clarity, and, if required by law, shall be accompanied by a copy or a detailed summary
thereof; and written notice shall be given to each shareholder of record, whether or not entitled to vote at such meeting, not less than 20 nor
more than 60 days before such meeting, in the manner provided in this Section 2.3 above.
(d) DECLARATION OF MAILING. A declaration of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any shareholders’
meeting, executed by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence
of the giving of such notice.
(e) WAIVER OF NOTICE. Notice of any shareholders’ meeting may be waived in writing by any shareholder at any time,
either before or after the meeting. Except as provided below, the waiver must be signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice, and be
delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. A shareholder’s attendance at a meeting waives
objection to lack of notice, or defective notice, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or
transacting business at the meeting.
2.4 QUORUM. A quorum shall exist at any meeting of shareholders if a majority of the shares entitled to vote is represented in
person or by proxy. Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares
exists with respect to that matter. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business at such meeting and
at any adjournment of such meeting (unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting), notwithstanding the withdrawal of
enough shareholders from either meeting to leave less than a quorum. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting other than
solely to object to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the
meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting.
2.5 VOTING OF SHARES. Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, and except as required by
law, every shareholder of record shall have the right at every shareholders’ meeting to one vote for every share standing in his or her name on
the books of the corporation. If a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the election of directors, is approved by a voting group if the votes
cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast within the
- 7 -
voting group opposing the action, unless a greater number is required by the Articles of Incorporation or the Washington Business Corporation
Act.
2.6 ADJOURNED MEETINGS. Whether or not a quorum exists, the chairman of the meeting (as provided in Section 2.11) or a
majority of the shares represented at a meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. When a meeting is adjourned
to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which
the adjournment is taken. However, if a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed in accordance with the Washington
Business Corporation Act, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date. At any
adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
2.7 RECORD DATE. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, or
any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date for any such
determination of shareholders, such date to be not more than 70 days and, in the case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior
to the meeting or action requiring such determination of shareholders. If no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the day before the date on which
notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may
be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
shareholders has been made as provided in this Section 2.7, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof, unless the Board of
Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned more than 120 days after the date is fixed for the original meeting.
2.8 RECORD OF SHAREHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE. After fixing a record date for a shareholders’ meeting, the corporation
shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all shareholders on the record date who are entitled to notice of the shareholders’ meeting. The
list shall be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and show the address of, and number of shares
held by, each shareholder. A shareholder, shareholder’s agent, or a shareholder’s attorney may inspect the shareholders list, beginning 10 days
prior to the shareholders’ meeting and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation’s principal office or at a place identified in the meeting
notice in the city where the meeting will be held during regular business hours and at the shareholder’s expense. The shareholders list shall be
kept open for inspection during such meeting or any adjournment. Failure to comply with the requirements of this Section 2.8 shall not affect the
validity of any action taken at such meeting.
2.9 ACTION BY SHAREHOLDERS WITHOUT A MEETING. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, any action
required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice if a consent in writing
setting forth the action to be taken shall be signed by all shareholders entitled to vote on the action.
2.10 PROXIES. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his or
her duly authorized attorney in fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy
shall be valid after three years from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy or by applicable law.
2.11 ORGANIZATION.
(a) At every meeting of shareholders, the Chairman of the Board of Directors (the “Chairman”), or, if a Chairman has not
been appointed or is absent, the Chief Executive Officer, or, if the Chief Executive Officer is absent, the President, or, if the President is absent, a
chairman of the meeting chosen by a majority of the Board of Directors, shall act as chairman. The Secretary, or, in his or her
- 8 -
absence, an Assistant Secretary directed to do so by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the chairman, shall act as secretary of the
meeting.
(b) The Board of Directors of the corporation shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings
of shareholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the
chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the
judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation,
establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those
present, limitations on participation in such meeting to shareholders of record of the corporation and their duly authorized and constituted proxies
and such other persons as the chairman shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof,
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the polls for balloting on
matters which are to be voted on by ballot. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting,
meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure.
2.12 SHAREHOLDER NOMINATIONS INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATION’S PROXY MATERIALS.
(a) INCLUSION OF SHAREHOLDER NOMINEES IN PROXY STATEMENT. Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.12,
if expressly requested in the relevant Nomination Notice (as defined below), the corporation shall include in its proxy statement for any annual
meeting of shareholders:
(i) the names of any person or persons nominated for election to the Board of Directors (each, a “Shareholder
Nominee”), which shall also be included on the corporation’s form of proxy and ballot, by any Eligible Holder (as defined below) or group
of up to 20 Eligible Holders that has (individually and collectively, in the case of a group) satisfied, as determined by the Board of
Directors, all applicable conditions and complied with all applicable procedures set forth in this Section 2.12 (such Eligible Holder or
group of Eligible Holders being a “Nominating Shareholder”);
(ii) disclosure about each Shareholder Nominee and the Nominating Shareholder required under the rules of the
SEC or other applicable law to be included in the proxy statement;
(iii) any statement included by the Nominating Shareholder in the Nomination Notice for inclusion in the proxy
statement in support of each Shareholder Nominee’s election to the Board of Directors (subject, without limitation, to Section 2.12(e)(ii)),
if such statement does not exceed 500 words and fully complies with Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, including Rule 14a-9 (or any successor rule) (the “Supporting Statement”); and
(iv) any other information that the corporation or the Board of Directors determines, in their discretion, to include in
the proxy statement relating to the nomination of each Shareholder Nominee, including, without limitation, any statement in opposition to
the nomination, any information provided pursuant to this Section 2.12 and any solicitation materials or related information with respect
to a Shareholder Nominee.
For purposes of this Section 2.12, any determination to be made by the Board of Directors may be made by the Board of Directors, a
committee of the Board of Directors or any officer of the corporation designated by the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of
Directors, and any such determination shall be final and binding on the corporation, any Eligible Holder, any Nominating Shareholder, any
Shareholder Nominee and any other person (without any further recourse). The chairman of any annual meeting of shareholders, in addition to
making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall have the power and duty to determine whether a
- 9 -
Shareholder Nominee has been nominated in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2.12 and, if not so nominated, shall direct and
declare at the meeting that such Shareholder Nominee shall not be considered.
(b) MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER NOMINEES.
(i) The corporation shall not be required to include in the proxy statement for an annual meeting of shareholders
more Shareholder Nominees than that number of directors constituting the greater of (A) two and (B) 20% of the total number of
directors of the corporation on the last day on which a Nomination Notice may be submitted pursuant to this Section 2.12 (rounded down
to the nearest whole number) (the “Maximum Number”).
(ii) The Maximum Number for a particular annual meeting shall be reduced by (A) Shareholder Nominees whom
the Board of Directors itself decides to nominate for election at such annual meeting; (B) Shareholder Nominees who cease to satisfy, or
Shareholder Nominees of Nominating Shareholders that cease to satisfy, the eligibility requirements in this Section 2.12, as determined
by the Board of Directors; (C) Shareholder Nominees whose nomination is withdrawn by the Nominating Shareholder or who become
unwilling or unable to serve on the Board of Directors; and (D) the number of incumbent directors who had been Shareholder Nominees
with respect to any of the preceding three annual meetings of shareholders and whose reelection at the upcoming annual meeting is
being recommended by the Board of Directors.
(iii) In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the deadline for
submitting a Nomination Notice as set forth in Section 2.12(d) but before the date of the annual meeting, and the Board of Directors
resolves to reduce the size of the board, the Maximum Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so
reduced.
(iv) If the number of Shareholder Nominees pursuant to this Section 2.12 for any annual meeting of shareholders
pursuant to this Section 2.12 exceeds the Maximum Number because there is more than one Nominating Shareholder, then, promptly
upon notice from the corporation, each Nominating Shareholder will select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the proxy
statement until the Maximum Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of the ownership position as
disclosed in each Nominating Shareholder’s Nomination Notice (as amended, as applicable), with the process repeated if the Maximum
Number is not reached after each Nominating Shareholder has selected one Shareholder Nominee. If, after the deadline for submitting a
Nomination Notice as set forth in Section 2.12(d), a Nominating Shareholder or a Shareholder Nominee ceases to satisfy the eligibility
requirements in this Section 2.12, as determined by the Board of Directors, a Nominating Shareholder withdraws its nomination or a
Shareholder Nominee becomes unwilling or unable to serve on the Board of Directors, whether before or after the mailing or other
distribution of the definitive proxy statement, then the nomination shall be disregarded, and the corporation (A) shall not be required to
include in its proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy the disregarded Shareholder Nominee or any successor or replacement
nominee proposed by the Nominating Shareholder or by any other Nominating Shareholder and (B) may otherwise communicate to its
shareholders, including without limitation by amending or supplementing its proxy statement or ballot or form of proxy, that a
Shareholder Nominee will not be included as a nominee in the proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy and will not be voted on
at the annual meeting.
(c) ELIGIBILITY OF NOMINATING SHAREHOLDER.
(i) An “Eligible Holder” is a person who has either (A) been a record holder of the shares of common stock used
to satisfy the eligibility requirements in this Section 2.12(c) continuously for the three-year period specified in subsection (ii) below or
(B) provides to the
- 10 -
Secretary of the corporation, within the time period referred to in Section 2.12(d), evidence of continuous ownership of such shares for
such three-year period from one or more securities intermediaries in a form that the Board of Directors determines would be deemed
acceptable for purposes of a shareholder proposal under Rule 14a-8(b)(2) under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule).
(ii) An Eligible Holder or group of up to 20 Eligible Holders may submit a nomination in accordance with this
Section 2.12 only if the person or group (in the aggregate) has continuously owned at least the Minimum Number (as defined below) of
shares of the corporation’s common stock throughout the three-year period preceding and including the date of submission of the
Nomination Notice, and continues to own at least the Minimum Number through the date of the annual meeting. Two or more funds that
are (A) under common management and investment control, (B) under common management and funded primarily by a single
employer, or (C) a “group of investment companies,” as such term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, shall be treated as one Eligible Holder if such Eligible Holder shall provide together with the Nomination Notice
documentation reasonably satisfactory to the corporation that demonstrates that the funds meet the criteria set forth in (A), (B) or (C) of
this Section 2.12(c)(ii). In the event of a nomination by a group of Eligible Holders, any and all requirements and obligations for an
individual Eligible Holder that are set forth in this Section 2.12, including the minimum holding period, shall apply to each member of
such group; provided, however, that the Minimum Number shall apply to the ownership of the group in the aggregate. Should any
shareholder cease to satisfy the eligibility requirements in this Section 2.12, as determined by the Board of Directors, or withdraw from a
group of Eligible Holders at any time prior to the annual meeting of shareholders, the group of Eligible Holders shall only be deemed to
own the shares held by the remaining members of the group.
(iii) The “Minimum Number” of shares of the corporation’s common stock means 3% of the number of outstanding
shares of common stock as of the most recent date for which such amount is given in any filing by the corporation with the SEC prior to
the submission of the Nomination Notice.
(iv) For purposes of this Section 2.12, an Eligible Holder “owns” only those outstanding shares of the corporation as
to which the Eligible Holder possesses both:
(A) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares; and
(B) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares;
provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) shall not include any shares (1) purchased or sold
by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (2) sold short by such Eligible Holder,
(3) borrowed by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates for any purpose or purchased by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates
pursuant to an agreement to resell or subject to any other obligation to resell to another person, or (4) subject to any option, warrant,
forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates,
whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of
outstanding shares of the corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect
of (x) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such Eligible Holder’s or any of its affiliates’ full right to vote or
direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (y) hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree, gain or loss arising from the full economic
ownership of such shares by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates.
- 11 -
An Eligible Holder “owns” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the Eligible Holder retains the right to
instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. An
Eligible Holder’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has delegated any
voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney, or other similar instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the
Eligible Holder. An Eligible Holder’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has
loaned such shares, provided that the Eligible Holder has the power to recall such loaned shares on five business days’ notice and
continues to hold such shares through the date of the annual meeting. The terms “owned,” “owning” and other variations of the word
“own” shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of the corporation are “owned” for these purposes shall be
determined by the Board of Directors.
(v) No Eligible Holder shall be permitted to be in more than one group constituting a Nominating Shareholder, and if
any Eligible Holder appears as a member of more than one group, it shall be deemed to be a member of the group that has the largest
ownership position as reflected in the Nomination Notice.
(d) NOMINATION NOTICE. To nominate a Shareholder Nominee, the Nominating Shareholder must deliver to the
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 120 or more than 150 days before the first anniversary of the date
that the corporation first sent its proxy statement for the prior year’s annual meeting of shareholders, all of the following information and
documents (collectively, the “Nomination Notice”); provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days
before or delayed by more than 30 days after such anniversary date, or if the corporation did not hold an annual meeting in the preceding year,
the Nomination Notice shall be given in the manner provided herein not earlier than the 150th day and not later than the close of business on the
later of the 120th day before such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting
is first made:

and otherwise qualifies as independent under the rules of the primary stock exchange on which the corporation’s shares
of common stock are traded;
(2) is not and has not been subject to any event specified in Rule 506(d)(1) of Regulation D (or any
successor rule) under the Securities Act of 1933 or Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K (or any successor rule) under the
Exchange Act, without reference to whether the event is material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of such
Shareholder Nominee; and
(3) is not a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
offenses) and has not been convicted in a criminal proceeding within the past 10 years;

(I) a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder will not engage in or aid or abet a “solicitation”

Exchange Act) (or any successor rules) with respect to the annual meeting, other than with respect to a Shareholder Nominee or
any nominee of the Board of Directors;
(J) a representation and warranty that the Nominating Shareholder will not use any proxy card other than the

nomination;
(iii) An executed agreement, in a form deemed satisfactory by the Board of Directors, pursuant to which the
Nominating Shareholder (including each group member) agrees:

(B) to file with the SEC any written solicitation or other communication with the corporation’s shareholders relating
to one or more of the corporation’s directors or director nominees or any Shareholder Nominee, regardless of whether any such

regulation;
(C) to assume all liability (which shall be joint and several with respect to other group members if any) stemming

officers or employees arising out of or relating to a failure or alleged failure of the Nominating Shareholder or any of its
Shareholder Nominees to comply with, or any breach or alleged breach of, its or their obligations, agreements or

(E) in the event that any information included in the Nomination Notice or any other communication by the
Nominating Shareholder (including with respect to any group member) with the corporation, its shareholders or any other person
in connection with the nomination or election ceases to be true and accurate in all material respects (or omits a material fact
necessary to make the statements made not misleading), or that the Nominating Shareholder (including any group member) has
failed to continue to satisfy the eligibility requirements described in Section 2.12(c), to promptly (and in any event within 48 hours
of discovering such misstatement, omission or failure) notify the corporation and any other recipient of such communication of
(1) the misstatement or omission in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to correct the
misstatement or omission or (2) such failure; and
(iv) An executed agreement, in a form deemed satisfactory by the Board of Directors, by each Shareholder

respect to and executed by each group member, in the case of information applicable to group members; and (ii) provided with respect
to the persons
- 14 -
specified in Instruction 1 to Items 6(c) and (d) of Schedule 14N (or any successor item) in the case of a Nominating Shareholder or

Nomination Notice is provided) have been delivered to or, if sent by mail, received by the Secretary of the corporation.

Supporting Statement) and no vote on such Shareholder Nominee will occur (notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may
have been received by the corporation), and the Nominating Shareholder may not, after the last day on which a Nomination Notice
would be timely, cure in any way any defect preventing the nomination of such Shareholder Nominee, if:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
3.1 MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY. All corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and
affairs of the corporation shall be managed under the direction of, the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise provided in the Articles of
Incorporation or the Washington Business Corporation Act.
3.2 NUMBER OF DIRECTORS, QUALIFICATION. The authorized number of directors of the corporation shall be as specified and
set by resolution from time to time by the Board of Directors. Directors need not be shareholders. No reduction of the authorized number of
directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director’s term of office expires.
- 16 -
3.3 ELECTION. Except as provided in Section 3.4, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of shareholders, and each
director so elected shall hold office until the annual meeting which takes place in the year in which his or her term expires and, except as
otherwise provided in this Section 3.3, until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.
In a non-contested election, a nominee for director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means that
the number of votes cast “for” a nominee’s election exceeds the number of votes cast “against” that nominee’s election. The following shall not
be votes cast: (a) a share as to which the ballot is marked as withheld with respect to the nominee; and (b) a share otherwise present at the
meeting but for which there is an abstention or as to which the holder gives no authority or direction with respect to the election of the nominee.
In a contested election, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. A contested election is one in which (a) on last day
for delivery of a notice under Section 2.1(d), a Holder has complied with the requirements of Section 2.1 with respect to one or more nominees
or, as applicable, on the last day for delivery of a notice under Section 2.12(d), a Nominating Shareholder has complied with the requirements of
Section 2.12 with respect to one or more nominees; and (b) prior to the date that notice of the meeting is given, the Board of Directors has not
made a determination that none of the candidacies of the Holder or the Nominating Shareholder creates a bona fide election contest. For
purposes of these Bylaws, it is assumed that on the last day for delivery of a notice under Section 2.1(d) or, as applicable, Section 2.12(d), there
is a candidate nominated by the Board of Directors for each of the director positions to be voted on at the meeting.
The following procedures apply in a non-contested election. A nominee who does not receive a majority of the votes cast shall not be elected. An
incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive a majority of the votes cast shall continue to serve as a holdover
director until the earliest of (a) 90 days after the date on which an inspector determines the voting results as to that director pursuant to Section
23B.07.035 of the RCW; (b) the date on which the Board of Directors appoints any qualified individual to fill the office held by such director,
which appointment shall constitute the filling of a vacancy by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 3.4; or (c) the date of the director’s
resignation. Any vacancy resulting from the non-election of a director under this Section 3.3 may be filled by the Board of Directors as provided
in Section 3.4. Except as provided in the next sentence, (a) the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider promptly whether to fill the
office of a nominee who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors about filling the office;
(b) the Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee’s recommendation and within 90 days after the certification of
the shareholder vote will disclose publicly its decision; and (c) no director who failed to receive a majority of the votes cast in such director’s
election will participate in the Nominating and Governance Committee recommendation or Board of Directors’ decision about filling his or her
office. If no director receives a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, then the incumbent directors (a) will nominate a slate of
directors comprised of any qualified individuals and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees as soon as practicable;
and (b) may in the interim fill one or more offices with the same nominees (or any other qualified individuals), who will continue in office until their
successors are elected.
3.4 VACANCIES. In the case of any vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors (whether caused by resignation, death, an
increase in the number of directors, non-election of a director pursuant to Section 3.3, or otherwise), the vacancy may be filled with any qualified
individual by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors. If the directors in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the Board of
Directors, they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors in office, or by a sole remaining director. A director
elected to fill any vacancy shall be identified by the class (Class I, II or III as set forth in Article V of the Articles of Incorporation) to which he or
she is named, so long as and to the extent the corporation maintains a classified board, and shall hold office until the next shareholders’ meeting
at which directors are elected and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier resignation, removal,
or non-election pursuant to Section 3.3.
- 17 -
3.5 REMOVAL. One or more members of the Board of Directors (including the full Board of Directors) may be removed, with or
without cause, at a meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose. A director may be removed if the number of votes cast to remove
the director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove the director.
3.6 RESIGNATION. Any director may resign at any time by delivering a written resignation to the Chairman or the Secretary, such
resignation to specify whether it will be effective at a particular time, upon receipt by the Chairman or Secretary, at the pleasure of the Board of
Directors. If no such specification is made, it shall be deemed effective at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. When one or more directors
shall resign from the Board of Directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned,
shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective,
and each director so chosen shall hold office for the unexpired portion of the term of the director whose place shall be vacated and until his or
her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.
3.6.1    RESIGNATIONS AND DIRECTOR ELECTIONS. Any nominee for director in an uncontested election (i.e., an election
where the number of persons properly nominated for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders does not exceed the number of directors
to be elected at such meeting) who receives a greater number of votes “withheld” from his or her election than votes “for” such election shall,
promptly following certification of the shareholder vote, offer a resignation to the Board of Directors for consideration in accordance with the
following procedures. Such offer shall become effective only if, as set forth below, the committee of Qualified Independent Directors accepts
such resignation.
In the event that any director has offered to resign pursuant to this Section 3.6.1, the Board of Directors shall establish a committee
comprised solely of Qualified Independent Directors and shall delegate to that committee the authority to determine the action to be taken with
respect to such offered resignation, which can include (a) accepting the offer of resignation; (b) maintaining the director but addressing what the
Qualified Independent Directors believe to be the underlying cause of the withhold votes; (c) resolving that the director will not be re-nominated
in the future for election; or (d) rejecting the offer of resignation. In reaching its decision, the committee shall consider all factors it deems
relevant, including (but not limited to): (i) any stated reasons why shareholders withheld votes from such director; (ii) any alternatives for curing
the underlying cause of the withheld votes; (iii) the director’s tenure; (iv) the director’s qualifications; (v) the director’s past and expected future
contributions to the corporation; and (vi) the overall composition of the Board of Directors, including whether accepting the resignation would
cause the corporation to fail to meet any applicable legal, regulatory, stock exchange, or contractual requirements. The term “Qualified
Independent Directors” means all directors who are (A) independent directors (as defined in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rules); and
(B) not required to offer their resignation in accordance with this Section 3.6.1. Prior to voting, the committee shall afford the affected director an
opportunity to provide any information or statement that the director deems relevant.
3.7 ANNUAL MEETING. The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors shall be known as the annual meeting thereof.
3.8 REGULAR MEETINGS. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors or of any committee designated by the Board of Directors
may be held at such place and such day and hour as shall from time to time be fixed by the Board of Directors or committee, without other notice
than the delivery of a notice as provided in Section 3.10.
3.9 SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board of Directors may
be called by the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or any director or committee member, to be held at such place and such

3.10 NOTICE OF MEETING. Notice of the date, time, and place of all special meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee
designated by the Board of Directors shall be given by the Secretary,

Assistant Secretary, or by the person calling the meeting, by mail, private carrier, telegram, facsimile transmission, or personal communication
over the telephone or otherwise, provided such notice is received at least two days prior to the day upon which the meeting is to be held.
Notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board of Directors need not be given to any director
or committee member if it is waived in a writing signed by the director entitled to the notice, whether before or after such meeting is held.
A director’s attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the director of the meeting unless the director at the
beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon the director’s arrival, objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does
not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or
special meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of
notice of such meeting unless required by the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws.
Any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board of Directors shall be a legal meeting without any notice
thereof having been given if all of the directors or committee members have received valid notice thereof, are present without objecting, or waive
notice thereof in a writing signed by the director and delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records,
or any combination thereof.
3.11 QUORUM OF DIRECTORS. A majority of the number of directors fixed by or in the manner provided by these Bylaws shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors
present is the act of the Board of Directors unless the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws require the vote of a greater number of directors.
A majority of the directors present, whether or not constituting a quorum, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. If the
meeting is adjourned for more than 48 hours, then notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given before the adjourned
meeting takes place, in the manner specified in Section 3.10, to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment.
3.12 PRESUMPTION OF ASSENT. Any director who is present at any meeting of the Board of Directors at which action on any
corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless (a) the director objects at the beginning of the meeting,
or promptly upon the director’s arrival, to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; (b) the director’s dissent or abstention from
the action taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or (c) the director delivers written notice of dissent or abstention to the presiding officer
of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or to the corporation within a reasonable time after adjournment of the meeting. Such right to
dissent or abstain shall not be available to any director who voted in favor of such action.
3.13 ACTION BY DIRECTORS WITHOUT A MEETING. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, provided that all members of the Board of Directors or committee individually or collectively
evidence such action by one or more consents executed by each director either before or after the action taken, and delivered to the corporation.
Each such consent shall be set forth in an executed record or in an executed electronic transmission to the corporation, as such term is defined
in Section 2.3. Such action by consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the Board of Directors or the committee.
Such consent and any counterparts thereof shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors.
3.14 TELEPHONIC MEETINGS. Members of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board of Directors may
participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by
means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other during the meeting.

3.15 COMPENSATION. The directors and committee members may be paid their expenses, if any, or a fixed sum or a stated salary
as a director or committee member for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or of such committee as the case may be. No such
payment shall preclude any director or committee member from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation
therefor.
3.16 COMMITTEES. The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the full Board of Directors, may from time to time
designate from among its members one or more committees, each of which must have two or more members and, to the extent provided in such
resolution, shall have and may exercise all the authority of the Board of Directors, except that no such committee shall have the authority to:

such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or an Assistant
Treasurer of the corporation or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile
signature of such person. In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose

other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be
