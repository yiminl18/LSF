information and entertainm ent products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencie s. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video
services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable network connectivity , security and control.  Formerly known as Bell
Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic), we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delawa re. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following
our mer ger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately  144,500  employees .
Our principal executive of fices are located at 1095 A venue of the Americas, New Y ork, New Y ork 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000).
We have two report able segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services, and customer
groups, respectively .
Wireless Wireless’ communications  products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer , business and
government customers across the United States (U.S.).
Wireline Wireline’ s communications products and enhanced services include video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network
services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and
government customers both in the U.S. and around the world.
In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business. We are modifying our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls to
accommodate the new structure and expect to transition to the new segment reporting structure during the second quarter of 2019. W e continue to report operating results to our
chief operating decision maker under our current operating segments.
Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in the 2018  Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders under the headings "Management’ s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview and - Segment Results of Operations" and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon
Communications Inc. and subsidiaries, which are incorporated by reference into this report.
Wireless
Backgr ound
Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications products and services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the
U.S. Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the U.S. as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2018 , Verizon Wireless had 118.0
million  retail connections and 2018  revenues of approximately $91.7 billion , representing approximately 70% of V erizon’ s aggregate revenues.
Cellco Partne rship (Cellco ), which originally held the wireless assets of Bell Atlantic, began operating as "Verizon Wireless" in April 2000 with both Vodafone Group Plc
(Vodafone) and Bell Atlantic as partners, following Vodafone’ s contribution of its U.S. wireless assets into Cellco. We acquired all of Vodafone’ s indirect 45% interest in
Verizon W ireless in 2014, which resulted in full ownership of V erizon W ireless.
Wireless Service and Pr oduct Offerings
Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand, customers that obtain wireless products and services that operate on
our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis and customers that utilize Internet of Things (IoT) services via our network.
Wireless Services
We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Custom ers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis.
Retail (non-w holesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its
branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A retail postpaid connection represents an individual line of
service for a wireless device for which a customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly  access charge in return for access to and usage of network services.
Approximately 96% of our total retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2018 . Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services
without credit verification by paying for all services in advance.
We offer various postpaid account service plans, including unlimited plans, shared data plans, single connection plans and other plans tailored to the needs of our customers.
Our unlimited  plans, available to our consumer and business customers, offer, among other things, unlimited domestic voice, data and texting. Our unlimited plans allow
customers to mix and match plans by line, with different benefits and inclusions beyond just traditional data access, voice and text. Our shared data plans typically feature
unlimited domestic voice, unlimited domestic and

international text, video and picture messaging, and a single data allowance that can be shared among the wireless devices on a customer ’s account. This allowance will vary
from time to time as part of promotional offers or in response to market circumstances.  Customers on certain fixed-data plans may carry over unused data allowances to the
next billing period, or stay online at a reduced data speed after using all of a data allowance for a billing period. Our unlimited and shared data plans include High Definition
(HD) Voice and Video Calling on compatible devices, and certain plans offer additional services, such as Mobile Hotspot services and free roaming in Canada and Mexico on
compatible devices. Our HD Voice services, enabled by Voice over LTE (VoLTE), deliver calls over our fourth-generation (4G) Long-T erm Evolution (LTE) network, and our
Video Calling service combines an HD Voice call with real-time video. Our Mobile Hotspot service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot that can provide
Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. Our unlimited plans provide customers the ability to stream DVD or HD quality videos, based on the service plan. We also
offer various voice and shared data plans for business customers.
As of January 2017, we no longer offer consumers  new fixed-term subsidized service plans for phones; however , we continue to offer subsidized plans to our business
customers, and we also continue to service existing fixed-term subsidized plans for consumers who have not yet purchased and activated devices under the Verizon device
payment program.
We also offer prepaid connection service plans that feature domestic unlimited voice and unlimited domestic and international text. We have both single line and multi-line
family option s, with individual line data plan selectio ns ranging from 500 megabytes per month to unlimited data. Family prepaid accounts include a line discount based on the
number of total lines. On compatible devices, our prepaid plans also feature video and picture messaging, HD Voice and Video Calling. Our metered prepaid plans include
Mobile Hotsp ot services and allow customers to continue to access our data services at reduced data speeds after using their monthly allowance for 4G LTE high speed data.
None of our prepaid plans require an annual contract or credit check.
Our international travel wireless services allow our customers to access voice, text and data services on many of our "World" smartphones, tablets or basic phones from various
international destinations, dependent upon the customer's wireless plan. With TravelPass, customers are able to use their domestic talk, text and data allowances while traveling
in Mexico, Canada and other countries where T ravelPass is available for a flat rate per day .
Access to the Internet is available on all smartphon es and nearly all basic phones. In addition, our customers can access the Internet at broadband speeds on notebook
computers and tablets that are either wireless enabled or that are used in conjunction with separate dedicated devices that provide a mobile W i-Fi connection.
We also provide network access needed to deliver various IoT products and services. We work with vario us companies that purchase network access from us to connect their
Open Development certified devices, bundled together with their own solutions, which they sell to end-users.
Wireless Equipment
We offer several categories  of wireless equipment, including a variety of smartphone and other handsets,  wireless-enabled Internet devices, such as tablets, laptop computers
and netbooks and other wireless enabled connected devices, such as smart watches and other wearables, and our Hum product.
Distribution
We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services.
Our direct channel include s our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers
and local, regional and national business customers. Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy . Our "Next Gen Design" retail stores focus on
our customer's evolving digital lifestyle.
Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the U.S., as well as through the Internet.
The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with
high-profile national retaile rs, which sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services, and with various convenience store chains, which sell our prepaid products
and services.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry . We compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc., Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc.,
as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers for
resale, including resellers that buy from us. Competition remains intense as a result of high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market, increased network
investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, offerings that include additional premium
content, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase as smaller , stand-
alone wireles s service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service  providers and as mobile virtual network operators resell wireless
communication services.
The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeki ng to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue
with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Google Inc., Apple
Inc. and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider ’s voice service, as well as
alternative means of accessing video content.

Table of Contents
We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry:
• Network reliability , capacity and coverage.  We consider a wireless network that consistently provides high-quality and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the
U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content,
have led to increased custo mer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively , wireless service providers
must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that the depth and breadth of our network
provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage in the wireless marketplace.
• Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape, with plans that address both the postpaid and prepaid customer . As
the demand for wireless services continues to grow , we and other wireless service providers are offering service plans at competitive prices that include voice services,
data access and text messaging, in some cases on an unlimited basis.  Many  other wireless service providers have also bundled wireless service offerings with other
products while others offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizo n Wireless. We and other wireless service providers, as well as
equipment manufacturers, also offer device payment options, which provide consumers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing
arrangements.  In addition, aggressive device promotions have also become more common in a highly penetrated market in order to gain share of subscribers interested in
changing carriers.
• Customer service. We believe that high-quali ty customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless
providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customer s with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and
focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. To promote long-term relationships with our customers, we launched the Verizon
Up program, which offers a variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related transactions with Verizon Wireless.
The program of fers customers discounts on products, services and access to experiences, such as sporting events, shows and concerts.
• Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be
increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and
innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers. We also collaborate with various device
manufacturers in the devel opment of distinctive smar tphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over
the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our customer base. In addition, as the
price for smartphones has continued to increase in the market, our device protection services have grown in importance for consumers.
• Sales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining
the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profit ability , as measured by operating income. We strive to increase
sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network
of retail outlets and prepaid  replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of laptops and netbooks that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds.
In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users , and to various companies to enable wireless
communications for their IoT devices or services.
• Capital r esour ces. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant
capital resources. W e generate significant cash flow from operations to enable continued investment.
Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless  industry . These include the factors described above, as well as new
technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic  trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies that bundle the
services of wireless and cable competitors.
Strategic T ransaction
During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to
lease and operate approximately 11,300  of our wirele ss towers and corresponding ground leases for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion . We have subleased capacity on the
towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew . Under  the terms of the lease agreements, America n Tower has
exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases  expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire
these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion.
See "Network  and Technology - Spectrum" for additio nal information regarding the NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink) and Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path)
strategic transactions related to the W ireless segment.

Wireline
Backgr ound
Our Wireline segm ent provides  communications products and enhanced services, including video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed
network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and government
customers both in the U.S. and around the world.  In 2018 , Wireline revenues were $29.8 billion , representing approximately 23% of V erizon’ s aggregate revenues.
To compensate for the shrink ing market for traditional copper -based products (such as voice services), we continue to build our Wireline business around a fiber-based network
supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We continue to seek ways to increase revenue,
further realize  operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability across the segment. We are reinventing our network architecture around a common fiber platform
that will support both our wireless and wireline businesses. We expect our "multi-use fiber" Intelligent Edge Network initiative will create opportunities to generate revenue
from fiber -based services in our W ireline business.
Wireline Service and Pr oduct Offerings
We organize our service and product offerings by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings - Consumer Markets, Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and
Business Markets.
Consumer Markets
Consumer Markets provide s residential fixed connec tivity solutions, including Internet, TV and voice services. We provide these services over our 100% fiber-optic network
under the brand "Fios" and over a traditional copper -based network to customers who are not served by Fios. In 2018 , Consumer Markets reven ues were $12.6 billion ,
representing approximately 42% of W ireline’ s aggregate revenues.
Internet serv ices. We offer our Fios customers fast and reliable 100% fiber-optic Internet connectivity . As customers connect more devices in their home and stream more high
definition video, the need for a fast and reliable Intern et connection is growing. In 2017, we introduced our Gigabit Connection in the marketplace, offering speeds of up to 940
Mbps on download and 880 Mbps on upload. As additional cloud-based applications are introduced, we believe that customers will place an increasing value on upstream
bandwidth performance that matches what they already receive for download. In other areas of our footpr int where Fios service is not available, we offer high speed Internet
(HSI) using Digital Subscriber Line technology .
Video services.  We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2018 , Fios video services were available to homes across 9 states, as well as the

Table of Contents
In addition to the tradition al voice and networking products and Fios services noted in the Consumer Markets section above, Business Markets also offers traditional circuit-
based networ k products and services, advanced networking solutions, advanced communications services , and security services, as noted in the Enterprise Solutions section
above.
Competition
The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional and non-traditional participants seeking increased
market share.  Current and potential competitors include cable  companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television
companies, Internet service providers, over -the-top providers and other companies that of fer network services and managed enterprise solutions.
In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service
providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large
contracts to provide integra ted services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong marke t presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all
of which contribute to intensifying competition that may af fect our future revenue growth.
We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry:
• Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability . Consumers and small business customers seek fast and reliable connections for entertainment, communications and
productivity . As Internet use increases, so do bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream.  We and other network-based providers must ensure that our
networks can meet these increasing bandwidth requirements. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors for our
Enterprise Solutions and Business Markets custome rs, which include state and local government and education (SLED) customers and small and medium business
(SMB) customers. W e continue to invest in our network to be able to meet growing bandwidth demand and provide reliable and secure networks.
• Pricing. Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a
significant factor as non-tr aditional modes of providing communication services emer ge and new entrant s compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based
voice and video calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues.
• Customer service.  Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area is
important for customer acquisition and retention. For our Consumer Markets and Business Markets customers, we compete in this area through our service
representatives and online support. We provide our Enterprise Solutions customers with ready access to their system and performance information and we conduct
proactive testing of our network to identify issues before they affect their customers. In our Partner Solutions business, service improvement is achieved through
continued system automation initiatives. 
• Product differ entiation. As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to
applications and are seekin g ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Conver ged featur es, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality , are
becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement.
• Innovation. The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively , providers need to continuously review , improve and
refine their product portfolio and customer service experience and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers.
In the Consum er Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital
products and services. We continue to market compet itive bundled offerings that include Fios Internet, TV, and voice services and we have introduced market offers targeted to
our V erizon W ireless customers. Several major cable operators also of fer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.
Customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a TV, computer , tablet or mobile phone. We expect
the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to over -the-top of ferings.
We expect customer migration from traditional voice  services to wireless services to continue as a growin g number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless
companies position their services as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet
portal providers.
In the Enterprise Solutions  market, competition remai ns high, primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology conver gence. We compete in this area with system
integrators, carriers, and hardware and software providers. In addition, some of the largest IT services companies are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic
assets or forging new allian ces to improve cost structure and focus on solutions which are growth catalysts for technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have
focused on emer ging fields, such as cloud computing, software delivery , communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than by the use of in-
house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisit ions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT
outsourcers.

wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity .
In Business Markets, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity with a consumer -like "look and feel" are becoming key
differentiators for both our SMB and SLED customers. SMB customers are seeking full life-cycle offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing their
businesses, while SLED customers want similar services that are high quality and secure, and that enable material improvement in citizen outreach, public safety and city
infrastructure performance.
Strategic T ransactions
In April 2016, we completed the sale (Access Line Sale) of our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet
and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states to Frontier Communications
Corporation (Frontier) for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6
billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier . The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange
carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and T exas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of V erizon W ireless.
The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the
related ILEC businesses from V erizon. Approximately 9,300 V erizon employees who served customers in California, Florida and T exas continued employment with Frontier .
In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2017, with Equinix , Inc. (Equinix)  pursuant to which we agreed to sell
23 customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately  $3.6 billion , subject to certain adjustments  (Data Center Sale) . The transaction closed in
May 2017.
In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire  XO Holdings' wireline business (XO), which owned and operat ed one of the largest fiber-based  IP and
Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently , we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings,
NextLink , that held its wireless spectr um. The agreement includ ed an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy NextLink. In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of
XO for total cash consideration of approximately  $1.5 billion , of which  $0.1 billion  was paid in 2015.
In April 2017, we exercise d our option to buy NextL ink for approximately  $0.5 billion , subject to certain adjustme nts, of which  $0.3 billion  was prepaid in the first quarter of
2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired
spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion  of wireless licenses, $0.1 billion  of a deferred tax liability and $0.1 billion  of other liabilities. The spectrum
acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment .
In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreem ent to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from  WideOpenW est, Inc. (WOW! ), a leading
provider of communicatio ns services. The transactio n closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! will
complete the build-out of the network assets in 2019 . The total cash consideration for the transactions is approximately  $0.3 billion , of which  $0.2 billion  was received in
December 2017.
Additional information regarding these strategic trans actions is included in the 2018  Verizo n Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3  to the consol idated financ ial statements
of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.
Network and Technology
Wireless
Our primary network technology platform is 4G LTE, which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G
technologies. In addition, over the past several years, we have been  leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and
mobile 5G wireless services.
Our 4G LTE network is available in approximately 500 markets covering approximately 331 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America
partners. Under this program, we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operat e a 4G LTE network using each carrier ’s network assets and our core
4G LTE equipment and 700 megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum . We currently have 21 LTE in Rural America partners that provide
4G L TE coverage to an area covering approximately three million people.
We use HD Calling, enabled by V oLTE, in addition to 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology , to provide voice calling services to our customers.
We consider the reliability , coverage and speed of our wireless network as key factors for our continued success and we strive to provide our customers with the highest
network reliability for their wireless services. We believe that steady and consistent network and platfo rm investments provide the foundation for innovative products and
services that will fuel profitable growth.

Table of Contents
We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, permitting the completion of
large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and also maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and
completed without being dropped. We have been densifying our 4G LTE network by utilizing small cell technology , in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems.
Network densification not only enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services, but also
positions us for the deployment of 5G technology . We are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer
experience. W e have and will continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates.
Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we
have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at every switch location. In
addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label
Switching backbone network in critical locations.
In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless servi ce providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in
nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming
arrangements with wireless service providers outside  of the U.S. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at will by either party upon several months’ notice;
however , we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse ef fect on our business.
Spectrum
The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobil e wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to provide these wireless services on porti ons of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellula r spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal
Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively ,
cover nearly all of the population of the U.S. This spectrum is collectively called low and mid-band spectrum.
In addition to our low and mid-band spectrum, we have spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 Gigahertz (GHz) band, collectively called millimeter -wave spectrum. In 2017, we
entered into transactions to acquire NextLink and Straight Path, each of which held millimeter -wave spectrum licenses. The NextLink acquisition closed in January 2018 and
the Straight Path acquisition closed in February 2018. The spectrum acquired as part of these transactions is being used for our 5G technology deployment.
In January 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band.  We participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum
licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015.
We are aggressively refarming 3G bands on 800 MHz and PCS bands for 4G LTE use. We anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This
increasing demand is drive n by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of
speed, as well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile  and fixed services. We can meet our future 4G and 5G spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from
other licensee s, or by acqui ring new spectrum license s from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur . On November 14, 2018, the FCC started two sequential
millimeter wave auctions. Verizon is an applicant in the FCC's Auction 101 and Auction 102 relating to millimeter wave spectrum. On January 24, 2019, the FCC announced
that Auction 101 had concluded with a total of approximately $702.6 million in bids received for the licenses that were won. The FCC has stated that it will not, and it will not
permit any applicant to, disclose the winning bidders of any of the licenses in Auction 101 until Auction 102 concludes. In addition, the FCC has indicated that a third
millimeter wave auction will begin in the second half of 2019, and the auction for Priority Access Licenses in the Citizens’ Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) 3.5 GHz band
may also begin in 2019. In addition to spectrum, we believe that future demand will also be met as we increase the density of our networks and deploy advanced technologies.
From time to time we have  exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue
similar oppor tunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. In certain cases, we have entered into intra market spectrum swaps
designed to increase the amount of contiguous spect rum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency .
These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.
Additional information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2018 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements of V erizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.
5G Deployment
We believe 5G technology can provide users with eight capabilities, or currencies. The eight currencies are peak data rates, mobile data volumes, mobility , connected devices,
energy efficiency, service deployment, latency and reliability . In late 2015 , we launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G
requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. W e expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current
4G LTE technology , lower latency and enable our network to handle more traffic as the number of Interne t-connected devices grows.  During 2018, we commercially launched
5G Home, our alternative to wired home broadband, on proprietary standards in four U.S. markets; Sacramento, Los Angeles, Houston and Indianapolis. We are the first
10
Table of Contents
company to bring 5G broadband Internet service to consumers and we expect to expand coverage as we transition to global standards equipment in 2019. In addition, we
expect to launch mobile 5G services in 2019 as compatible devices become available.
Network Equipment and Build-Out
As we continue to build and upgrade our existing 4G LTE network and deploy our 5G network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large
number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells. As we densify our network, we follow a
similar process for small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that compr ise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide
variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our network operations. We utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of
our existing leased and owned tower sites.
Wireline
Fios
Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow . The continued
emer gence of new video services, new data applicati ons and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data
speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost-ef fective
and efficient manner . Our PON technology provide s the flexibility to adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services without major overhauls or
replacements to the fiber -optic infrastructure.
While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our PON infrastructure is also finding more widespread application in the enterprise sector , especially as businesses
increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services.
Global IP
Verizon owns and operate s one of the largest globa l fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150 countries. Our global IP
network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 1 million route miles and enable and support international operations.
Global busine ss is rapidly evolving to an "everything -as-a-service" model in which business customers seek cloud-based, conver ged enterprise solutions delivered securely via
managed and professional services. With the continue d deployment of packet optical transport strategy , Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global network platform that
combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology . The result is a global IP network that can of fer powerful solutions to these service demands.
We believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments,
will help V erizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential, SMB, government and enterprise customers.
Intelligent Edge Network
We are evolving our network architecture to a next-generation multi-use platform, providing improved efficiency , increased automation and opportunities for edge computing
services that will support both our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. We call this the Intelligent Edge Network. We expect that the new network architecture
will simplify operations by eliminating legacy networ k elements, improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology , deliver high-speed Fios broadband to
homes and businesses, and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market.
Media
Backgr ound
Verizon has been investing  in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. Our Media business, Verizon Media, which operated in
2018 under the "Oath" brand, includes diverse medi a and technology brands that serve the global community using powerful technology , trusted content and differentiated
data. Our strategy is built on providing consumers with owned and operated search properties and finance, news, sports and entertainment offerings and providing other
businesses and partners access to consumers through  digital advertising platforms. We have been investing in video assets and capabilities with a goal of building a global

Strategic T ransactions
In June 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL), a leader in digital content and advertisin g. AOL ’s business model aligns with our approach, and we believe
that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams.
In June 2017, we complete d our acquisition of the operating business of Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo), a leader in search, communications, digital content and advertising. Additional
discussion of the transaction is included in the 2018  Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3  to the consol idated financi al statements of Verizon Communications Inc.
and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.
We have established relationships with leading sports  leagues to bring compelling content to our customers across our digital platforms. In December 2017, we entered into a
multi-year partnership with the National Football League (NFL) in which Verizon’ s portfolio of premium digital and mobile media properties, such as Yahoo Sports, stream in-
market and national game s, including national pre-season, regular season and playof f games, and the Super Bowl, to mobile phones. In January 2018, we entered into an
innovative, multi-year partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) that will deliver one of the most comprehensive video streaming of ferings of NBA content -
from live out-of-market games via NBA League Pass to highlights, fantasy basketball, original programm ing and more via Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Fantasy and across Verizon’ s

to deliver premium NBA content and unique fan experiences. V erizon also has rights to deliver leading soccer games, including La Liga and Liga MX, to its customers.
We have also entered into content partnerships to realize syner gies available within the marketplace. In April 2018, we entered into an agreement with Samsung in which our
Gemini adver tising platfor m became the exclusive provider of native digital advertising on Samsung mobile products on the Verizon network. In May 2018, Verizon selected
Amazon Web Services, Inc. as its preferred public cloud provider . Also, in January 2019, Verizon Media entered into a multi-year global native advertising deal with Microsoft
to provide marketers access to 20 percent more native advertising inventory through our Ad Platforms; and an exclusive search advertising partnership in which all search
advertising across V erizon Media properties will be served by Microsoft Bing.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue
the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad.
We also activ ely grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable
them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their produc ts and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage
of the results  of Verizon’ s research and developmen t efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to us, we do not believe that the loss of such
consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material ef fect on our results of operations.
We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We
also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us
directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease
offering the relevant products or services.

Regulatory and Competitive Trends
Regulatory and Competitive Landscape
Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competi tive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless
companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional companies. Many of
these compan ies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our
future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary
regulator . The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act
or Act). Other V erizon services are subject to state and local regulation.
Federal Regulation
Wireless Services
The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally , the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless
communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon
anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for license d spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others,
or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions.
Today , Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC
spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While  the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’ s wireless licenses,
challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that
license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers
to use device s and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including
construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless
tower and antenna facilities.
Broadband
Verizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally , the FCC recognized broadband Internet  access services as "information services" subject to a "light touch"
regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. In 2015, the FCC declared that broadband Internet access services are "telecommunications
services" subject to commo n carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order reversing the 2015 Title II Order to
return to "light touch" regulation of broadband Internet access services. This order is currently being challenged in the courts. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains
committed to the open Internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want,
and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility .verizon.com/broadband-commitment.
Wireline V oice
Verizon offers many different wireline voice services,  including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes,
legacy telephone services are generally considered to be "common carrier" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to
rates, terms and conditions  and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply
with certain rules, such as 91 1 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.
Video
Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also
generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local
authorities.
Privacy and Data Security
We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless,
broadband and the develop ment and roll out of new products, such as those in the media and IoT space. At the federal level, our voice business is subject to the FCC's privacy
requirements. Oversight of broadband Internet access privacy and data security , which had shifted from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the FCC following the FCC's
adoption of its 2015 Title II Order , returned to the FTC as a result of the FCC's repeal of the 2015 Title II Order . Generally , attention to privacy and data security requirements
is increasing at both the state and federal level, and several privacy-related bills have been introduced  or are under considerations at each level. In addition, a new data
protection regulation went into effect in Europe in May 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and a new privacy law is scheduled to take effect in
California in 2020. These laws could have a significant impact on certain of our businesses.

Public Safety and Cybersecurity
The FCC has played a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emer gency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media
(broadcast/cable) and wireless emer gency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurre d or could occur in the future, however , the FCC or other regulators
may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers.
Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access
The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other
aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline "business data services" and other
services and network facili ties. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. In April 2017, the FCC issued an
order , which is currently under appeal, that revised the regulatory structure for business data services, eliminating tariffing obligations and ex ante price regulations in markets
the FCC determined to be competitive. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for
business data services may be appropriate.
State Regulation and Local Regulation
Wireless Services
The Act generally preempt s regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating
the other "terms and condit ions" of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several
states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna
facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.
Wireline Services
State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’ s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an "incumbent local
exchange carrier" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and
requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operati ons that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many states, Verizon has been required to
obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations, as a result.
Environmental Matters
Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to
address conta mination at the site of a former Sylvani a facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army
Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the
contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the
parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The following discussion of "Risk Factors" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect  our business, operations, financial condition or futur e performance.
This information should be read in conjunction with "Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Result of Operations" and the consolidated financial
statements and related notes. The following discuss ion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when
evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our futur e results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in
forwar d-looking statements.
Operational Risks
Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.
Cyber attacks , including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for
obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse
effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable
technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations. Cybe r attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in
frequency , scope and poten tial harm in recent years. Further , the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed
by company employees or external actors operating in any geography , including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or
ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. Cyber attacks may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of
service is an objective of the attacker . While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks which , individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's
operations or financial condition, the preventive actio ns we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be
insuf ficient to repel or mitigate the ef fects of a major cyber attack in the future.
The inability to operate or use our networks and syste ms or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of
time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon
could include  expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their busin ess, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of
alternate resources, lost revenues from business interr uption and litigation. The potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain.
Further , certain of V erizon’ s businesses, such as those of fering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively af fected if our
ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Moreover , our increasing presence in the IoT industry with offerings of
telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to poten tial costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber
attacks impac ting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and
sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation,
adversely impact customer and investor confidence, and could further result in a material adverse ef fect on V erizon’ s results of operation or financial condition.
Natural disasters, terr orist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructur e and r esult in significant disruptions to our operations.
Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could
cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degra dation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain
insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy
may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the
suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide  products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing
significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these
occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.
We depend on key suppliers and vendors to pr ovide equipment that we need to operate our business.
We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment,
smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide produc ts to our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device
suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipset s, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide
equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our
customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one
supplier to another , our business could be substantia lly disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with
products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating
efficiencies and have a material adverse ef fect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The suppliers and vendors  on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent
infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry . We are unable to predict whether our
17
Table of Contents
business will be af fected by any such litigation. W e expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology .
A significant portion of our workfor ce is r epresented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a r esult of the
renegotiation of our labor contracts.
As of December 31, 2018 , approximately 23% of our workf orce was represented by labor unions. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent
negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while less than 1% of the
workforce of our wireless and other businesses outsid e of wireline is represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this
workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations.
Economic and Strategic Risks
We face significant competition that may r educe our pr ofits.
We face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among
wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies,
wireless servi ce providers,  satellite providers, applic ation and device providers and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of
products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own compe titive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively , we could
experience lower than expe cted revenues and earnings. A projected sustained decline in any of our reporting units' revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on its
fair value and cause us to record goodwill impairment charges in the future. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a $4.6 billion ($4.5 billion after-tax)
goodwill impairment charge on our Media reporting unit. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial
condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with
their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting
Verizon Wireless customer s. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality , capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and
services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services , the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our
capital resour ces. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors  affecting our industries, including new technologies and business
models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these
competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits.
If we ar e not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and addr ess changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the
demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience r educed pr ofits.
Our industries  are rapidly changing as new technolog ies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the
markets we serve. In order  to grow and remain comp etitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology , enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings
to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose
customers to our competito rs. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the succes s of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or
regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and
introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely af fected.
In addition to introducing new offerings and technolo gies, such as 5G technology , we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to
do so on a cost-ef fective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.
Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our r esults of operations.
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession  or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our
products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer
higher margin services, dropping down in price plans  or obtaining lower -cost products and services offered  by other companies. Similarly , under these conditions, the business
customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic
conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur , it could have a material
adverse ef fect on our results of operations.

Legal and Regulatory Risks
Changes in the r egulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business pr ospects or r esults of operations.
Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencie s, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign
governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified
products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often
involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the
outcome of pending federa l and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing
laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly , we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in
obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10
years, subject  to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a mate rial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level, such as those described below , could restrict the
ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our Media and Telematics businesses, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and
potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers.
• Privacy and data protection  - we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. A new data protection regulation, which
went into effect in Europe in May 2018, includes significant penalties for non-compliance. A new privacy law scheduled to take effect in California in 2020, also
could have a significant impact on certain of our businesses.
• Regulation of broadband Internet access services  - In its 2015 Title II Order, the FCC nullified its longstanding "light touch" approach to regulating broadband
Internet access services and "reclassified" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The FCC repealed the
2015 Title II Order in December 2017, and returned to its traditional light-touch approach for these servic es. The 2017 order has been appealed to the D.C. Circuit;
the outcome and timing of this appeal or any other challenge remains uncertain. Several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders
that would impose net neutrality and other requiremen ts on some of our services (in some cases different from the FCC’ s 2015 rules). The enforceability and effect of
these state rules is uncertain.
• "Open Access"  - we hold certain wireles s licenses that require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regula tions, which generally require licensees of
particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover , certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the
FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services.
The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return
we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.
We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could r equir e us to pay significant damages or settlements.
We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and
hour class actions, persona l injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also
faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in
defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.
Financial Risks
Verizon has significant debt, which could incr ease further if V erizon incurs additional debt in the futur e and does not r etire existing debt.
As of December 31, 2018 , Verizon had approximately $103.0 billion  of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, as well as approximately $9.4 billion  of unused borrowing
capacity under its existing credit facility . Verizon’ s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:
• requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt, which would reduce
the funds V erizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;
• making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt
refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;
• reducing V erizon’ s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industries and market conditions;
• making V erizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and
19
Table of Contents
• exposing V erizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates.
Adverse changes in the cr edit markets could incr ease our borr owing costs and the availability of financing.
We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets.
Adverse chan ges in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borro wing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our
operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies,
which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing
and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financi ng. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do
business, and such instability could also af fect our access to financing.
Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and r etiree healthcar e benefits may r educe our pr ofitability and incr ease our funding commitments.
With approximately 144,500  employees and approximately 195,000 retirees as of December 31, 2018  eligibl e to participate in Verizon’ s benefit plans, the costs of pension
benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability . Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for
these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding  the potential modification of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality
assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce
our profitability and increase our funding commitments.
Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

buildings or any other buildings that house network equipment, and buildings that are used for administrative and other purposes. Substantially all the switching centers are
located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the network and high set-up relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the U.S. comprised of
administrative and sales offices, customer care center s, retail sales locations, garage work centers, switchin g centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of
telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, of fice equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction and leasehold improvements.
Item 3.    Legal Proceedings
In Octo ber 2013, the California Attorney General’ s Office notified certain Verizon companies of potent ial violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily
arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilitie s. We are cooperating with this investigation and continue to review
our operations relating to the management of hazard ous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties
ultimately incurred will be material.

Item 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
The principal market for trading in the common stock of Verizon is the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "VZ". As of December 31, 2018 , there were 630,756
shareholders of record.
Stock Repurchases
In March 2017, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Company's common stock. The program will
terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches  100 million, or at the close of business on February 28, 2020, whichever is sooner . Under the program,
shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through  plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The
timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any , will depend on market conditions and the Company’ s capital allocation priorities.
During the years ended December 31, 2018  and 2017 , Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’ s common stock under our authorized share buyback programs. At
December 31, 2018, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of V erizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.

Table of Contents
In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended
to ensure an effective internal control environment. During the fourth quarter of 2018 , we implemented certain internal controls in connec tion with the new lease accounting
standard, which we adopted effective January 1, 2019. Other than the above-noted change, there were no changes in the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting
during the fourth quarter of 2018  that have materially af fected, or are reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.

EXHIBIT 10c(ix)
VERIZON COMMUNICA TIONS INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
SPECIAL PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED ST OCK UNIT AGREEMENT
AGREEMENT between V erizon Communications Inc. (“V erizon” or the “Company”) and you (the “Participant”) and your heirs and beneficiaries.
1. Purpose of Agr eement. The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to the Participant.
2. Agr eement. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to the 2017 V erizon Communications Inc. Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and evidences the grant of a
restricted stock unit award in the form of RSUs pursuant to the Plan. In consideration of the benefits described in this Agreement, which Participant acknowledges are good,
valuable and suf ficient consideration, the Participant agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions
set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement and the Participant’ s non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and other obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibit B to
this Agreement, both of which are incorporated into and are a part of the Agreement. The RSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. By
executing this Agreement, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’ s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement. In addition, the Participant agrees to be bound by the actions of the Human Resources Committee
of Verizon Communication’ s Board of Directors or any successor thereto (the “Committee”), and any designee of the Committee (to the extent that such actions are exercised
in accordance with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement). If there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
shall control.
3. Contingency . The grant of RSUs is contingent on the Participant’ s timely acceptance of this Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions contained in it. Acceptance
shall be through execution of the Agreement as set forth in paragraph 21. If the Participant does not accept this Agreement by the close of business on February 12, 2018, the
Participant shall not be entitled to this grant of RSUs regardless of the extent to which the requirements in paragraph 5 (“V esting”) are satisfied. In addition, to the extent a
Participant is on a Company approved leave of absence, including but not limited to short-term disability leave, he or she will not be entitled to this grant of RSUs until such
time as he or she returns to active employment with V erizon or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) and accepts this Agreement within the time period established
by the Company .
4. Number of Units. The Participant is granted the number of RSUs as specified in the Participant’ s account under the Special Performance RSU grant, administered by
Fidelity Investments or any successor thereto (“Fidelity”). A RSU is a hypothetical share of V erizon’ s common stock. The value of a RSU on any given date shall be equal to
the closing price of V erizon’ s common stock on the New Y ork Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) as of such date. A Dividend Equivalent Unit (“DEU”) or fraction thereof shall be
added to each RSU each time that a dividend is paid on V erizon’ s common stock. The amount of each DEU shall be equal to the corresponding dividend paid on a share of
Verizon’ s common stock. The DEU shall be converted into RSUs or fractions thereof based upon the closing price of V erizon’ s common stock traded on the NYSE on the
dividend payment date of each declared dividend on V erizon’ s common stock, and such RSUs or fractions thereof shall be added to the Participant’ s RSU balance. To the
extent that Fidelity or the Company makes an error , including but not limited to an administrative error with respect to the number or value of the RSUs granted to the
Participant under this Agreement, the DEUs credited to the Participant’ s account or the amount of the final award payment, the Company or Fidelity specifically reserves the
right to correct such error at any time and the Participant agrees that he or she shall be legally bound by any corrective action taken by the Company or Fidelity .
5. Vesting.
(a) T ime-Based V esting.  The Participant shall vest in one hundred percent (100%) of the total number of RSUs subject to this grant, including DEUs credited with
respect to such RSUs pursuant to the terms hereof (the “T arget Number of RSUs”), on December 31, 2020. The Participant must be continuously employed by the
Company or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) from the date the RSUs are granted through December 31, 2020 as a condition to vesting of any RSUs
hereunder , except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 (“Early Cancellation/Accelerated V esting of RSUs”) or as otherwise provided by the Committee.
(b) Additional Performance-Based V esting.
(1) General.  If both (x) the T arget Number of RSUs vest pursuant to paragraph 5(a) or Section 7(c)(1) and (y) V erizon’ s Wireless Service Revenue (as defined below)
during the three-year period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending at the close of business on December 31, 2020 meets or exceeds xxx Dollars ($xxx), then an
additional number of RSUs shall vest as of December 31, 2020 equal to fifty percent (50%) of the T arget Number of RSUs.
(2) Definition of W ireless Service Revenue.  As used in this Agreement, the term “W ireless Service Revenue” means revenue generated from access to and usage of
the wireless network, as such terms are used in V erizon’ s consolidated financial statements. The Committee will (to the extent necessary and without duplication)
adjust such revenue to eliminate the financial impact of (i) acquisitions, divestitures or changes in business structure; (ii) changes in legal, tax, accounting or
regulatory policy; and (iii) other
1
items that are extraordinary in nature or not deemed to be in the ordinary course of business. The Committee’ s determination of whether , and the extent to which, any
such adjustment is necessary shall be final and binding.
(c) T ransfer . Transfer of employment from V erizon to a Related Company , from a Related Company to V erizon, or from one Related Company to another Related
Company shall not constitute a separation from employment hereunder , and service with a Related Company shall be treated as service with the Company for purposes of
the continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a).
6. Payment. All payments under this Agreement shall be made in shares of V erizon common stock. Subject to paragraph 7(a), as soon as practicable after December 31, 2020
(but in no event later than March 15, 2021), the number of shares that vested (minus any withholding for taxes) shall be paid to the Participant. The number of shares that shall
be paid (plus withholding for taxes) shall equal the number of RSUs that vested pursuant to the terms hereof. If the Participant dies before any payment due hereunder is made,
such payment shall be made to the Participant’ s beneficiary , as designated under paragraph 1 1. Once a payment has been made with respect to a RSU, the RSU shall be

contained herein shall be made by the arbitrator . To the fullest extent permitted by law , the EB Committee shall have full power , discretion, and authority to interpret the
Plan and this Agreement and to decide all Plan Disputes brought under this Plan and Agreement. Determinations made by the EB Committee shall be final, conclusive and
binding, subject only to review by arbitration pursuant to paragraph (c) below under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review . A Participant’ s failure to refer a Plan

pursuant to the aforesaid rules of the AAA no later than one year from the date that the claim accrues, except where a longer limitations period is required by applicable

of the AAA ’s Commercial Arbitration Rules may be obtained from Human Resources. The Participant agrees that the arbitration shall be held at the of fice of the AAA

by the Company or a Related Company against the Participant, except for breaches of any of the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to
this Agreement, may also be raised in such arbitration proceedings.
(i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether any dispute submitted for arbitration hereunder is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall decide all
issues submitted for arbitration according to the terms of the Plan, this Agreement (except for breaches of any of the Participant’ s obligations and
restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement), existing Company policy , and applicable substantive Delaware State and U.S. federal law and
shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief permitted by such laws. The final decision of the EB Committee with respect to a Plan Dispute shall
be upheld unless such decision was arbitrary or capricious. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive, not subject to appeal, and binding and
enforceable in any applicable court.
(ii) The Participant understands and agr ees that, pursuant to this Agr eement, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company waive
any right to sue each other in a court of law or equity , to have a trial by jury , or to r esolve disputes on a collective, or class, basis (except for
breaches of any of the Participant’ s obligations and r estrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agr eement), and that the sole forum available
for the r esolution of Units A ward Disputes and Units Damages Disputes is arbitration as pr ovided in this paragraph 25. If an arbitrator or court
finds that the arbitration pr ovisions of this Agr eement ar e not enfor ceable, both Participant and the Company or a Related Company understand
and agr ee to waive their right to trial by jury of any Units A ward Dispute or Units Damages Dispute. This dispute r esolution pr ocedur e shall not
prevent either the Participant or the Company or a Related Company fr om commencing an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for the
purpose of obtaining injunctive r elief to pr event irr eparable harm pending and in aid of arbitration her eunder; in such event, both the Participant
and the Company or a Related Company agr ee that the party who commences the action may pr oceed without necessity of posting a bond.
(iii) In consideration of the Participant’ s agreement in paragraph (ii) above, the Company or a Related Company will pay all filing, administrative and
arbitrator ’s fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings. If the AAA requires the Participant to pay the initial filing fee, the Company or a
Related Company will reimburse the Participant for that fee. All other fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including but not
limited to each party’ s attorney’ s fees, will be the responsibility of such party .
(iv) The parties intend that the arbitration procedure to which they hereby agree shall be the exclusive means for resolving all Units A ward Disputes and
Units Damages Disputes (subject to the mandatory EB Committee procedure provided for in paragraph 25(b) above). Their agreement in this regard shall
be interpreted as broadly and inclusively as reason permits to realize that intent.
(v) The Federal Arbitration Act (“F AA”) shall govern the enforceability of this paragraph 25. If for any reason the F AA is held not to apply , or if
application of the F AA requires consideration of state law in any dispute arising under this Agreement or subject to this dispute resolution provision, the
laws of the State of Delaware shall apply without giving ef fect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
(vi) T o the extent an arbitrator determines that the Participant was not terminated for Cause and is entitled to the RSUs or any other benefits under the Plan
pursuant to the provisions applicable to an involuntary termination without Cause, the
5
Participant’ s obligation to execute a release satisfactory to V erizon as provided under paragraph 7(c)(2) shall remain applicable in order to receive the
benefit of any RSUs pursuant to this Agreement.
26. Additional Remedies. Notwithstanding the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, and in addition to any other rights or

this Agreement are not specifically enforced and that monetary damages will not adequately protect the Company and any Related Company from a breach of such
Participant obligations and restrictions;
(e) If any dispute arises concerning the violation or anticipated or threatened violation by the Participant of any of the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in
Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, an injunction may be issued restraining such violation pending the determination of such controversy , and no bond or other security
shall be required in connection therewith;

this Agreement;

the Participant’ s non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality restrictions, shall result in the Participant’ s immediate forfeiture of all rights and benefits, including
all RSUs and DEUs, under this Agreement; and

and any damages (including but not limited to damages resulting in the forfeiture of an award or benefits under this Agreement) that may result from the breach of such
Participant obligations and restrictions shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, but shall instead

EXHIBIT 10c(viii)
VERIZON COMMUNICA TIONS INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
2018 RESTRICTED ST OCK UNIT AGREEMENT
AGREEMENT between V erizon Communications Inc. (“V erizon” or the “Company”) and you (the “Participant”) and your heirs and beneficiaries.
1. Purpose of Agr eement. The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to the Participant.
2. Agreement. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to the 2017 V erizon Communications Inc. Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and evidences the grant of a
restricted stock unit award in the form of RSUs pursuant to the Plan. In consideration of the benefits described in this Agreement, which Participant acknowledges are good,
valuable and suf ficient consideration, the Participant agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions
set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement and the Participant’ s non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and other obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibit B to
this Agreement, both of which are incorporated into and are a part of the Agreement. The RSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. By
executing this Agreement, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’ s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement. In addition, the Participant agrees to be bound by the actions of the Human Resources Committee
of Verizon’ s Board of Directors or any successor thereto (the “Committee”), and any designee of the Committee (to the extent that such actions are exercised in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement). If there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.
3. Contingency . The grant of RSUs is contingent on the Participant’ s timely acceptance of this Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions contained in it. Acceptance
shall be through execution of the Agreement as set forth in paragraph 21. If the Participant does not accept this Agreement by the close of business on June 29, 2018, the
Participant shall not be entitled to this grant of RSUs regardless of the extent to which the requirements in paragraph 5 (“V esting”) are satisfied. In addition, to the extent a
Participant is on a Company approved leave of absence, including but not limited to short-term disability leave, he or she will not be entitled to this grant of RSUs until such
time as he or she returns to work with V erizon or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) and accepts this Agreement within the time period established by the
Company .
4. Number of Units. The Participant is granted the number of RSUs as specified in the Participant’ s account under the 2018 RSU grant, administered by Fidelity Investments
or any successor thereto (“Fidelity”). A RSU is a hypothetical share of V erizon’ s common stock. The value of a RSU on any given date shall be equal to the closing price of
Verizon’ s common stock on the New Y ork Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) as of such date. A Dividend Equivalent Unit (“DEU”) or fraction thereof shall be added to each RSU
each time that a dividend is paid on V erizon’ s common stock with respect to each dividend record date that occurs after the date of grant and prior to the payment of an RSU.
The amount of each DEU shall be equal to the corresponding dividend paid on a share of V erizon’ s common stock. The DEU shall be converted into RSUs or fractions thereof
based upon the closing price of V erizon’ s common stock traded on the NYSE on the dividend payment date of each declared dividend on V erizon’ s common stock, and such
RSUs or fractions thereof shall be added to the Participant’ s RSU balance. DEUs that are credited will be subject to the same vesting, termination and other terms as the RSUs
to which they relate. To the extent that Fidelity or the Company makes an error , including but not limited to an administrative error with respect to the number or value of the
RSUs granted to the Participant under this Agreement, the DEUs credited to the Participant’ s account or the amount of the final award payment, the Company or Fidelity
specifically reserves the right to correct such error at any time and the Participant agrees that he or she shall be legally bound by any corrective action taken by the Company or
Fidelity .
5. Vesting.
(a) General.  The Participant shall vest in the RSUs as follows: one-third of the total number of RSUs subject to this grant (including DEUs credited with respect to such
RSUs) shall vest on April 9, 2019, one-third of the total number of RSUs subject to this grant (including DEUs credited with respect to such RSUs) shall vest on April 9,
2020, and the remaining number of RSUs subject to this grant (including DEUs credited with respect to such RSUs) shall vest on April 9, 2021. The Participant must be
continuously employed by the Company or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) from the date the RSUs are granted through each of the applicable vesting
dates specified in this paragraph 5(a) as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the RSUs, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 (“Early
Cancellation/Accelerated V esting of RSUs”) or as otherwise provided by the Committee.
(b) T ransfer . Transfer of employment from V erizon to a Related Company , from a Related Company to V erizon, or from one Related Company to another Related
Company shall not constitute a separation from employment hereunder , and service with a Related Company shall be treated as service with the Company for purposes of
the continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a). If the Participant transfers employment pursuant to this paragraph 5(b), the Participant will still be required to
satisfy the definition of “Retire” under paragraph 7 of this Agreement in order to be eligible for the accelerated vesting provisions in connection with a retirement.

vesting date (minus any withholding for taxes) shall be paid to the
1
Participant. The amount of cash that shall be paid (plus withholding for taxes) shall equal the number of RSUs that vested on the applicable vesting date times the closing price
of Verizon’ s common stock on the NYSE as of the applicable vesting date (or if the common stock is not traded on such vesting date, last trading date that immediately
precedes the applicable vesting date). If the Participant dies before any payment due hereunder is made, such payment shall be made to the Participant’ s beneficiary , as
designated under paragraph 1 1. Once a payment has been made with respect to a RSU, the RSU shall be cancelled; however , all other terms of the Agreement, including but

of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and ef fect. In the event that any provision, including any of the Participant’ s obligations or restrictions set forth in Exhibits

necessary to make the provision enforceable according to applicable law and shall be enforced as amended. The RSUs are intended not to be subject to any tax, interest or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with such intent.

the enforceability of the waiver in paragraph 25(c)(ii). Decisions about the applicability of the limitations period contained herein shall be made by the arbitrator . A copy
of the AAA ’s Commercial Arbitration Rules may be obtained from Human Resources. The Participant agrees that the arbitration shall be held at the of fice of the AAA
nearest the place of the Participant’ s most recent employment by the Company or a Related Company , unless the parties agree in writing to a dif ferent location. All
claims by the Company or a Related Company against the Participant, except for breaches of any of the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A
and B to this Agreement, may also be raised in such arbitration proceedings.
(i)    The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether any dispute submitted for arbitration hereunder is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall decide all
issues submitted for arbitration according to the terms of the Plan, this Agreement (except for breaches of any of the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions
set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement), existing Company policy , and applicable substantive Delaware State and U.S. federal law and shall have the
authority to award any remedy or relief permitted by such laws. The final decision of the EB Committee with respect to a Plan Dispute shall be upheld unless
such decision was arbitrary or capricious. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive, not subject to appeal, and binding and enforceable in any
applicable court.
(ii)    The Participant understands and agr ees that, pursuant to this Agr eement, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company waive
any right to sue each other in a court of law or equity , to have a trial by jury , or to r esolve disputes on a collective, or class, basis (except for
breaches of any of the Participant’ s obligations and r estrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agr eement), and that the sole forum available
for the r esolution of Units A ward Disputes and Units Damages Disputes is arbitration as pr ovided in this paragraph 25. If an arbitrator or court
finds that the arbitration pr ovisions of this Agr eement ar e not enfor ceable, both Participant and the Company or a Related Company understand
and agr ee to waive their right to trial by jury of any Units A ward Dispute or Units Damages Dispute. This dispute r esolution pr ocedur e shall not
prevent either the Participant or the Company or a Related Company fr om commencing an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for the
purpose of obtaining injunctive r elief to pr event irr eparable harm pending and in aid of arbitration her eunder; in such event, both the Participant
and the Company or a Related Company agr ee that the party who commences the action may pr oceed without necessity of posting a bond.
(iii)    In consideration of the Participant’ s agreement in paragraph (ii) above, the Company or a Related Company will pay all filing, administrative and
arbitrator ’s fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings. If the AAA requires the Participant to pay the initial filing fee, the Company or a
Related Company will reimburse the Participant for that fee. All other fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including but not limited
to each party’ s attorney’ s fees, will be the responsibility of such party .
(iv)    The parties intend that the arbitration procedure to which they hereby agree shall be the exclusive means for resolving all Units A ward Disputes and
Units Damages Disputes (subject to the mandatory EB Committee procedure provided for in paragraph 25(b) above). Their agreement in this regard shall be
interpreted as broadly and inclusively as reason permits to realize that intent.
5
(v)    The Federal Arbitration Act (“F AA”) shall govern the enforceability of this paragraph 25. If for any reason the F AA is held not to apply , or if
application of the F AA requires consideration of state law in any dispute arising under this Agreement or subject to this dispute resolution provision, the laws
of the State of Delaware shall apply without giving ef fect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
(vi)    To the extent an arbitrator determines that the Participant was not terminated for Cause and is entitled to the RSUs or any other benefits under the Plan
pursuant to the provisions applicable to an involuntary termination without Cause, the Participant’ s obligation to execute a release satisfactory to V erizon as
provided under paragraph 7(c)(2) shall remain applicable in order to receive the benefit of any RSUs pursuant to this Agreement.
26. Additional Remedies.  Notwithstanding the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, and in addition to any other rights or
remedies, whether legal, equitable, or otherwise, that each of the parties to this Agreement may have (including the right of the Company to terminate the Participant for Cause
or to involuntarily terminate the Participant without Cause), the Participant acknowledges that—
(a) The Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement are essential to the continued goodwill and profitability of the Company
and any Related Company;
(b) The Participant has broad-based skills that will serve as the basis for other employment opportunities that are not prohibited by the Participant’ s obligations and
restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement;
(c) When the Participant’ s employment with the Company or any Related Company terminates, the Participant shall be able to earn a livelihood without violating any of
the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement;
(d) Irreparable damage to the Company or any Related Company shall result in the event that the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to
this Agreement are not specifically enforced and that monetary damages will not adequately protect the Company and any Related Company from a breach of any of
such Participant obligations and restrictions;
(e) If any dispute arises concerning the violation or anticipated or threatened violation by the Participant of any of the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in
Exhibits A or B, an injunction may be issued restraining such violation pending the determination of such controversy , and no bond or other security shall be required in
connection therewith;
(f) The Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement shall continue to apply after any expiration, termination, or cancellation
of this Agreement;
(g) The Participant’ s breach of any of the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, including, for example, any breach of
the Participant’ s non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality restrictions, shall result in the Participant’ s immediate forfeiture of all rights and benefits, including
all RSUs and DEUs, under this Agreement; and
(h) All disputes relating to the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, including their interpretation and enforceability
and any damages (including but not limited to damages resulting in the forfeiture of an award or benefits under this Agreement) that may result from the breach of such
Participant obligations and restrictions shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, but shall instead
be determined in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(c) Company Policies Regarding Securities T ransactions.  By accepting this award of RSUs, you agree to comply with all Company policies regarding trading in

EXHIBIT 10c(x)
VERIZON COMMUNICA TIONS INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
SPECIAL PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED ST OCK UNIT AGREEMENT
AGREEMENT between V erizon Communications Inc. (“V erizon” or the “Company”) and you (the “Participant”) and your heirs and beneficiaries.
1. Purpose of Agr eement. The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to the Participant.
2. Agr eement. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to the 2017 V erizon Communications Inc. Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and evidences the grant of a
restricted stock unit award in the form of RSUs pursuant to the Plan. In consideration of the benefits described in this Agreement, which Participant acknowledges are good,
valuable and suf ficient consideration, the Participant agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions
set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement and the Participant’ s non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and other obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibit B to
this Agreement, both of which are incorporated into and are a part of the Agreement. The RSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. By
executing this Agreement, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’ s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement. In addition, the Participant agrees to be bound by the actions of the Human Resources Committee
of Verizon’ s Board of Directors or any successor thereto (the “Committee”), and any designee of the Committee (to the extent that such actions are exercised in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement). If there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.
3. Contingency . The grant of RSUs is contingent on the Participant’ s timely acceptance of this Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions contained in it. Acceptance
shall be through execution of the Agreement as set forth in paragraph 21. If the Participant does not accept this Agreement by the close of business on June 29, 2018, the
Participant shall not be entitled to this grant of RSUs regardless of the extent to which the requirements in paragraph 5 (“V esting”) are satisfied. In addition, to the extent the
Participant is on a Company approved leave of absence, including but not limited to short-term disability leave, he will not be entitled to this grant of RSUs until such time as
he returns to work with V erizon or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) and accepts this Agreement within the time period established by the Company .
4. Number of Units. The Participant is granted the number of RSUs as specified in the Participant’ s account under the Special Performance RSU grant, administered by
Fidelity Investments or any successor thereto (“Fidelity”). A RSU is a hypothetical share of V erizon’ s common stock. The value of a RSU on any given date shall be equal to
the closing price of V erizon’ s common stock on the New Y ork Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) as of such date. A Dividend Equivalent Unit (“DEU”) or fraction thereof shall be
added to each RSU each time that a dividend is paid on V erizon’ s common stock with respect to each dividend record date that occurs after the date of grant and prior to the
payment of an RSU. The amount of each DEU shall be equal to the corresponding dividend paid on a share of V erizon’ s common stock. The DEU shall be converted into
RSUs or fractions thereof based upon the closing price of V erizon’ s common stock traded on the NYSE on the dividend payment date of each declared dividend on V erizon’ s
common stock, and such RSUs or fractions thereof shall be added to the Participant’ s RSU balance. DEUs that are credited will be subject to the same vesting, termination and
other terms as the RSUs to which they relate. To the extent that Fidelity or the Company makes an error , including but not limited to an administrative error with respect to the
number or value of the RSUs granted to the Participant under this Agreement, the DEUs credited to the Participant’ s account or the amount of the final award payment, the
Company or Fidelity specifically reserves the right to correct such error at any time and the Participant agrees that he shall be legally bound by any corrective action taken by
the Company or Fidelity .
5. Vesting.
(a) T ime-Based V esting.  The Participant shall vest in one hundred percent (100%) of the total number of RSUs subject to this grant, including DEUs credited with
respect to such RSUs pursuant to the terms hereof (the “T arget Number of RSUs”), on April 9, 2021. The Participant must be continuously employed by the Company or a
Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) from the date the RSUs are granted through April 9, 2021 as a condition to vesting of any RSUs hereunder , except as
otherwise provided in paragraph 7 (“Early Cancellation/Accelerated V esting of RSUs”) or as otherwise provided by the Committee.
(b) Additional Performance-Based V esting.
(1) General.   If both (x) the T arget Number of RSUs vest pursuant to paragraph 5(a) or Section 7(c)(1) and (y) Oath Inc.’ s Revenue (as defined below) during the
three-year period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending at the close of business on December 31, 2020 meets or exceeds xxx Dollars ($xxx), then an additional
number of RSUs shall vest as of April 9, 2021, equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the T arget Number of RSUs.  
(2) Definition of Revenue.   As used in this Agreement, the term “Revenue” has the meaning given to such term under GAAP . The Committee will (to the extent
necessary and without duplication) adjust such revenue to eliminate the financial impact of (i) acquisitions, divestitures or changes in business structure; (ii) changes
in legal, tax, accounting or regulatory policy; and
1
(iii) other items that are extraordinary in nature or not deemed to be in the ordinary course of business. The Committee’ s determination of whether , and the extent to
which, any such adjustment is necessary shall be final and binding.
(c) T ransfer . Transfer of employment from V erizon to a Related Company , from a Related Company to V erizon, or from one Related Company to another Related

this Agreement, may also be raised in such arbitration proceedings.
(i)    The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether any dispute submitted for arbitration hereunder is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall decide all issues

Exhibits A and B to this Agreement), existing Company policy , and applicable substantive Delaware State and U.S. federal law and shall have the authority to award
any remedy or relief permitted by such laws. The final decision of the EB Committee with respect to a Plan Dispute shall be upheld unless such decision was
arbitrary or capricious. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive, not subject to appeal, and binding and enforceable in any applicable court.
(ii)    The Participant understands and agr ees that, pursuant to this Agr eement, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company waive any
right to sue each other in a court of law or equity , to have a trial by jury , or to r esolve disputes on a collective, or class, basis (except for br eaches of any of
the Participant’ s obligations and r estrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agr eement), and that the sole forum available for the r esolution of Units
Award Disputes and Units Damages Disputes is arbitration as pr ovided in this paragraph 25. If an arbitrator or court finds that the arbitration pr ovisions
of this Agr eement ar e not enfor ceable, both Participant and the Company or a Related Company understand and agr ee to waive their right to trial by jury
of any Units A ward Dispute or Units Damages Dispute. This dispute r esolution pr ocedur e shall not pr event either the Participant or the Company or a
Related Company fr om commencing an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining injunctive r elief to pr event irr eparable
harm pending and in aid of arbitration her eunder; in such event, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company agr ee that the party who
commences the action may pr oceed without necessity of posting a bond.
(iii) In consideration of the Participant’ s agreement in paragraph (ii) above, the Company or a Related Company will pay all filing, administrative and arbitrator ’s
fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings. If the AAA requires the Participant to pay the initial filing fee, the Company or a Related Company will
reimburse the Participant for that fee. All other fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including but not limited to each party’ s attorney’ s fees,
will be the responsibility of such party .
(iv) The parties intend that the arbitration procedure to which they hereby agree shall be the exclusive means for resolving all Units A ward Disputes and Units
Damages Disputes (subject to the mandatory EB Committee procedure provided for in paragraph 25(b) above). Their agreement in this regard shall be interpreted as
broadly and inclusively as reason permits to realize that intent.
(v) The Federal Arbitration Act (“F AA”) shall govern the enforceability of this paragraph 25. If for any reason the F AA is held not to apply , or if application of the
FAA requires consideration of state law in any dispute arising under this Agreement or subject to this dispute resolution provision, the laws of the State of Delaware
shall apply without giving ef fect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
(vi) T o the extent an arbitrator determines that the Participant was not terminated for Cause and is entitled to the RSUs or any other benefits under the Plan pursuant
to the provisions applicable to an involuntary termination without Cause, the Participant’ s obligation to execute a release satisfactory to V erizon as provided under
paragraph 7(c)(2) shall remain applicable in order to receive the benefit of any RSUs pursuant to this Agreement.

shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New Jersey without giving ef fect to that jurisdiction’ s choice of law rules; and (c)

6.2    Amount of Payment . Each Unit shall represent the right to receive, subject to any vesting requirements applicable to such Unit, an amount equal to (a) the Company

Units in connection with such event. For example, and without limitation, if V erizon contributed assets valued at $1 Billion to the Company at a time when the value of a Unit
(as determined pursuant to Section 6.2 immediately before giving ef fect to such contribution) was $25, the Administrator could increase the T otal Indicative Units by an
additional Forty Million (e.g., if the then-existing amount was 207,040,000, the increase would be from 207,040,000 to247,040,000; $1 Billion divided by $25 is Forty
Million) ef fective at the time and to account for such contribution. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 6.3 may apply as to any Unit (including A wards then
outstanding) to the extent the Payment Date for such Unit had not occurred prior to the ef fective time of such adjustment.
6.4    Timing and Form of Payment . Any payment of a vested Unit as provided in this Article 6 shall be made on or following the applicable Payment Date of such Unit as
provided in the A ward Agreement. Such payment shall be made in cash; provided, however , that if the Shares are listed or admitted to trade on a national securities exchange

dividing (a) the amount of such payment as determined under Section 6.2, by (b) the Fair Market V alue of a Share at the time such payment is made.
Article 7. Award Agr eements
7.1    In General. Each A ward shall be evidenced by an A ward Agreement that shall include such provisions as the Administrator shall determine and that shall specify the
number of Restricted Stock Units granted and the applicable vesting and payment terms.
7.2    Severance fr om Service. Each A ward Agreement shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have rights, if any , under the A ward following the Participant’ s
severance from service with the Company and its Subsidiaries. The A ward Agreement may make distinctions based on the reason for the Participant’ s severance from service
and may contain obligations that apply beyond the term of the A ward Agreement.

delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due in connection with any A wards. If any such deferral is required or permitted, the Administrator shall establish rules and
procedures for such deferrals in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
Article 10. No Right to Employment or Participation

EXHIBIT 10o(i)
AOL INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
FOUNDERS’ GRANT UNIT AGREEMENT
AGREEMENT between AOL Inc. (the “Company”) and you (the “Participant”) and your heirs and beneficiaries.
1. Purpose of Agr eement. The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a grant of Restricted Share Units (“Units”) to the Participant. This award satisfies in full the
Participant’ s right to receive a “Founders Incentive A ward” with respect to the Company pursuant to the Participant’ s offer letter with V erizon Communications Inc. dated May
12, 2015.
2. Agr eement. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to the AOL Inc. Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and evidences the grant of Units pursuant to the Plan. In
consideration of the benefits described in this Agreement, which Participant acknowledges are good, valuable and suf ficient consideration, the Participant agrees to comply
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement (the “Participant’ s
Obligations”) which are incorporated into and are a part of the Agreement. The Units and this Agreement are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. By executing this
Agreement, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’ s Obligations. In
addition, the Participant agrees to be bound by the actions of the Administrator (to the extent that such actions are exercised in accordance with the terms of the Plan and this
Agreement). If there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.
3. Contingency . The grant of Units is contingent on the Participant’ s timely acceptance of this Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions contained in it. Acceptance
shall be through execution of the Agreement as set forth in paragraph 21. If the Participant does not accept this Agreement by the close of business on September 30, 2015, the
Participant shall not be entitled to this grant of Units regardless of the extent to which the requirements in paragraph 5 (“V esting”) are satisfied. In addition, to the extent a
Participant is on a Company approved leave of absence, including but not limited to short-term disability leave, he or she will not be entitled to this grant of Units until such
time as he or she returns to active employment with the Company or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) and accepts this Agreement within the time period
established by the Company .
4. Number of Units. Effective on the date the Units are granted (the “Grant Date”), the Participant is granted the number of Units as specified in the Participant’ s account
under the “Founders’ 15” grant administered by Fidelity Investments, or any other record keeper appointed by the Company with respect to the Plan or any successor to either
of them (“Fidelity”). A “Unit” is a contingent right to receive a payment as determined under Section 6 of the Plan and the provisions of this Agreement. To the extent that
Fidelity or the Company makes an error , including but not limited to an administrative error with respect to the number of Units granted to the Participant under this
Agreement, the Company or Fidelity specifically reserves the right to correct such error at any time and the Participant agrees that he or she shall be legally bound by any
corrective action taken by the Company or Fidelity .
5. Vesting.
(a) General.  The Units shall vest as to one-half (1/2) of the Units on June 22, 2018, and as to one-half (1/2) of the Units on June 22, 2019 (each such anniversary date, a
“Vesting Date”). Vesting of the Units is subject in each case to the Participant’ s continuous employment by the Company or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph
13) from the Grant Date through the applicable V esting Date, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 (“Early Cancellation/Accelerated V esting of Units”) or as
otherwise provided by the Administrator .
(b) Transfer . Transfer of employment from the Company to a Related Company , from a Related Company to the Company , or from one Related Company to another
Related Company shall not constitute a separation from employment hereunder , and service with a Related Company shall be treated as service with the Company for
purposes of the continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a). If the Participant transfers employment pursuant to this paragraph 5(b), the Participant will still be
required to satisfy the definition of “Retire” under paragraph 7 of this Agreement in order to be eligible for the accelerated vesting provisions in connection with a
retirement.
6. Payment. Any Units that vest pursuant to the terms hereof shall be paid in the amount and manner provided in Section 6 of the Plan. Such payment shall be made as soon as
practicable after the V esting Date for such Units (but in no event later than two and one-half months after the V esting Date). Such payment shall be subject to all applicable tax
withholding. If the Participant dies before any payment due hereunder is made, such payment shall be made to the Participant’ s beneficiary , as designated under paragraph 1 1.
Once a payment has been made with respect to a Unit, the Unit shall be canceled; however , all other terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’ s
Obligations, shall remain in ef fect.
7. Early Cancellation/Accelerated V esting of Units. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, Units may vest or be forfeited before the V esting Date as follows:
1
(a) T ermination for Cause. If the Participant’ s employment by the Company or a Related Company is terminated by the Company or a Related Company for Cause at
any time prior to the date that the Units are paid pursuant to paragraph 6, the Units (whether vested or not) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the
applicable termination date without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant.
(b) Retir ement Mor e Than Six Months After Grant Date, T ermination Due to Death or Disability , Involuntary T ermination without Cause or T ermination for
Good Reason On or Befor e Vesting Date.

(iii) Separates from employment by reason of a termination by the Company or a Related Company without Cause (as defined below) or a termination by the
Participant for Good Reason (as defined below), in each case on or before a V esting Date.
(2) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph 7(g), if the Participant separates from employment on or before the V esting Date under circumstances described in
paragraph 7(b)(1), the continuous employment requirement set forth in paragraph 5(a) shall be deemed satisfied 
in full as if the Participant’ s employment with the Company had continued through the V esting Date.
(3) Any Units that vest pursuant to paragraph 7(b)(2) shall be payable at their regularly scheduled time as specified in paragraph 6.
(c)    Retir ement W ithin Six Months of Grant Date, V oluntary T ermination or Other Separation Not Described in Paragraph 7(a), 7(b) or 7(d). If the Participant
(i) Retires (as defined in paragraph 7(e)(4)) before the date that is six months after the Grant Date, or (ii) otherwise separates from employment on or before a V esting
Date under any circumstances not described in paragraph 7(a), 7(b) or 7(d), all the Units shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable termination
date without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant.
(d) Change in Contr ol. If a Participant’ s employment with the Company or a Related Company is involuntarily terminated without Cause or the Participant voluntarily
terminates employment for Good Reason within twelve (12) months following the occurrence of a Change in Control and before a Vesting Date, then, subject to the
conditions set forth in paragraph 7(g), the Units shall vest and become payable (without prorating the award) and the continuous employment requirement set forth in
paragraph 5(a) shall be deemed satisfied in full as if the Participant’ s employment with the Company had continued through the V esting Date; provided, however , that all
other terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’ s Obligations, shall remain in ef fect. A Change in Control or an involuntary termination without
Cause or a voluntary termination for Good Reason that occurs after a particular V esting Date shall have no ef fect on whether any Units scheduled to vest on the V esting
Date vest or become payable under this paragraph 7. If both paragraph 7(b) and this paragraph 7(d) would otherwise apply in the circumstances, this paragraph 7(d) shall
control. Any Units that vest pursuant to this paragraph 7(d) shall be payable at their regularly scheduled time as specified in paragraph 6.

record with respect to any Shares that may be issued in payment of the Units as provided in Section 6 of the Plan. Except as provided in the Plan or in this Agreement, no
adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs while the Units are outstanding.
9. Amendment of Agr eement.  Except to the extent required by law or specifically contemplated under this Agreement, neither the Administrator (or his or her designee) may ,
without the written consent of the Participant, change any term, condition or provision af fecting the Units if the change would have a material adverse ef fect upon the Units or

purposes of this Agreement.
14. Employment Status. The grant of the Units shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment for a particular term between the Company or a Related Company

15. Tax Matters.
(a) T ax W ithholding . The Participant acknowledges that he shall be responsible for any taxes that arise in connection with this grant of Units, and the Company shall
make such arrangements as it deems necessary for withholding of any taxes it determines are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. In the

(b) Limitation on Acceleration . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan or this Agreement, subject to the terms of any employment agreement between
the Company or any Related Company and the Participant that provides for the treatment of Units that is more favorable to the Participant than this paragraph 15(b), if the
Payment (as hereinafter defined) due to the Participant hereunder as a result of any acceleration of vesting of the Units pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Agreement, either
alone or together with all other Payments received or to be received by the Participant from the Company or any Related Company (collectively , the
3
“Aggregate Payments”), or any portion thereof, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor thereto), the following
provisions shall apply:
(i) If the net amount that would be retained by the Participant after all taxes on the Aggregate Payments are paid would be greater than the net amount that
would be retained by the Participant after all taxes are paid if the Aggregate Payments were limited to the lar gest amount that would result in no portion of
the Aggregate Payments being subject to such excise tax, the Participant shall be entitled to receive the Aggregate Payments.
(ii) If, however , the net amount that would be retained by the Participant after all taxes were paid would be greater if the Aggregate Payments were limited
to the lar gest amount that would result in no portion of the Aggregate Payments being subject to such excise tax, the Aggregate Payments to which the
Participant is entitled shall be reduced to such lar gest amount.
As used herein, the term “Payment” shall mean any transfer of property within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
The determination of whether any reduction of Aggregate Payments is required and the timing and method of any such required reduction in Payments under this
Agreement or in any such other Payments otherwise payable by the Company or any Related Company consistent with any such required reduction, shall be made by the
Participant, including whether any portion of such reduction shall be applied against any cash or any shares of stock of the Company or any other securities or property to
which the Participant would otherwise have been entitled under this Agreement or under any such other Payments, and whether to waive the right to the acceleration of
the Payment due under this Agreement or any portion thereof or under any such other Payments or portions thereof, and all such determinations shall be conclusive and
binding on the Company and the Related Companies. To the extent that Payments hereunder or any such other Payments are not paid as a consequence of the limitation
contained in this paragraph 15(b), then the Units (to the extent not so accelerated) and such other Payments (to the extent not vested) shall be deemed to remain
outstanding and shall be subject to the provisions hereof and of the Plan as if no acceleration or vesting had occurred.
The Company shall promptly pay , upon demand by the Participant, all legal fees, court costs, fees of experts and other costs and expenses which the Participant incurred
in any actual, threatened or contemplated contest of the Participant’ s interpretation of, or determination under , the provisions of this paragraph 15(b).
16. Compliance with Laws. The granting and payment of the Units hereunder is subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any
governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.
17. Administrator Authority . The Administrator shall have complete discretion in the exercise of its rights, powers, and duties under this Agreement. Any interpretation or
construction of any provision of, and the determination of any question arising under , this Agreement shall be made by the Administrator in its discretion, as described in
paragraph 9. The Administrator may delegate ministerial, non-discretionary functions to individuals who are of ficers or employees of the Company or a Related Company or to
third parties.
18. Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, any successor or successors of the Company and the person or entity to whom the Units may
have been transferred by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or beneficiary designation. All terms and conditions of this Agreement imposed upon the Participant shall,
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, be deemed, in the event of the Participant’ s death, to refer to and be binding upon the Participant’ s heirs and beneficiaries.
19. Construction. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be considered separate and apart from the remainder
of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and ef fect. In the event that any provision, including any of the Participant’ s Obligations, is held to be unenforceable for
being unduly broad as written, such provision shall be deemed amended to narrow its application to the extent necessary to make the provision enforceable according to
applicable law and shall be enforced as amended. The Units are intended not to be subject to any tax, interest or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement
shall be construed and interpreted consistent with such intent.
20. Defined T erms. Except where the context clearly indicates otherwise, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions ascribed to them by the Plan, and the
terms of the Plan shall apply where appropriate.
21. Execution of Agr eement. The Participant shall indicate his consent and acknowledgment to the terms of this Agreement (including the Participant’ s Obligations) and the
Plan by executing this Agreement pursuant to the instructions provided and otherwise shall comply with the requirements of paragraph 3. In addition, by consenting to the

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Verizon Comm unications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of communications,
information and entertainm ent products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencie s. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video
services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable network connectivity , security and control.  We have a highly diverse
workforce of approximately  144,500  employees  as of December 31, 2018 .
To compete effectively in today’ s dynamic marketplace, we are focused on transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks with a goal of future growth
based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. During 2018, we focused on leveraging our network leadership, retaining and growing our high-
quality custom er base while balancing profitability , enhancing ecosystems in growth businesses, and driving monetization of our networks and solutions. Our strategy requires
significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber-
optic network that supports  our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system
capabilities. W e believe that steady and consistent investments in our networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth.
We are consistently deploy ing new network architectu re and technologies to extend our leadership in both fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks.
Our Intelligent Edge Netw ork design allows us to realize significant efficiencies by utilizing common infrastructure within the core and providing flexibility at the edge of the
network to meet customer requirements. In addition, protecting the privacy of our customers’ information and the security of our systems and networks will continue to be a

Highlights of Our 2018 Financial Results
(dollars in millions)

Business Overview
We have two report able segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services, and customer
groups, respectively .
Revenue by Segment
———
Note: Excludes eliminations.
Wireless
Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications products and services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the
United States ( U.S.). We provide these services and equipment sales to consumer , business and government customers across the U.S. on a postpaid and prepaid basis. A retail
postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in
return for access to and usage of network services.  Our prepaid service enable s individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in
advance.  Our wireless customers also include other companies  who resell network services to their end-users  using our network. Our reseller customers are billed for services
in arrears.
We are focusing our wireless capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-T erm Evolution (LTE) network. We are densifying our 4G LTE network by
utilizing smal l cell technology , in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification not only enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile
video consumption and the growing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) products and services, but also positions us for the deployment of 5G technology . Over the past
several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services.  We believe
5G technology can provid e users with eight capabilities, or currencies. The eight currencies are peak data rates, mobile data volumes, mobility , connected devices, energy
efficiency , service deployment, latency and reliability . We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G requirements and standards
and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4G LTE technology , lower
latency and enable our network to handle more traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows . During 2018, we commercially launched 5G Home, our alternative
to wired home broadband, on proprietary standards in four U.S. markets; Sacramento, Los Angeles, Hous ton and Indianapolis. Total Wireless segment operating revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2018  totaled $91.7 billion , an increase of  $4.2 billion, or 4.8%,  compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 .
Wireline
Our Wireline segm ent provides  communications products and enhanced services, including video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed
network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and government
customers both in the U.S. and around the world.
In our Wireline business, to compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper -based products (such as voice services), we continue to build our Wireline business
around a fiber-based network supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We continue to seek
ways to increase revenue, further realize operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability across the segment. We are reinventing our network architecture around a
common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline businesses. W e expect our "multi-use fiber" Intelligent Edge Network initiative will create opportunities
to generate revenue from fiber-based services in our Wireline business.  Total Wireline segment operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018  totaled $29.8 billion ,
a decrease of  $0.9 billion, or 3.0%,  compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 .
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other includes the results of our Media business, Verizon Media, which operated in 2018  under the "Oath" brand, our telematics business, branded Verizon
Connect, and other businesses, investments in unconsolidated businesses, unallocated corporate expenses, pension and other employee benefit related costs and interest and
financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing
segment performance due to their nature. Although
such transactions are exclu ded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolid ated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not
individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
Verizon Media, our organiz ation that combined  Yahoo! Inc.'s (Yahoo ) operating business with our pre-existing Media business, includes diverse media and technology brands
that engage users around the world . Our strategy  is built on providing consumers with owned and operated search properties and finance,  news, sports and entertainment
offerings and providing other businesses and partners access to consumers through digital advertising platforms. T otal operating revenues for our Media business, branded Oath
and included in Corporate  and other , were $7.7 billion for the year ended, December 31, 2018 . This was an increase of 28.8% from the year ended December 31, 2017 ,
primarily due to the acquisition of Y ahoo's operating business in June of 2017.
We are also building our growth capabilities in the emer ging IoT market by developing business models  to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and platform
layers. During  the years ended December 31, 2018  and 2017 , we recogniz ed IoT revenues (including Verizon Connect) of $1.6 billion  and $1.5 billion , an 11% and 52%
increase, respectively , compared to the prior year .
Capital Expenditur es and Investments
We continue to invest in our wireless network, high-s peed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future. During the
year ended December 31, 2018 , these investments included $16.7 billion  for capital expenditures. See "Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities" and "Operating Environment
and Trends" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient,
reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy .
Recent Developments
In September 2018, Verizon announced a voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees. Approximately 10,400 eligible employees will separate
from the Com pany under this program by the end of June 2019, with nearly half of these employees having exited in December of 2018. Principally as a result of this program
but also as a result of other headcount reduction initiatives, the Company recorded a severance charge of $1.8 billion  ($1.4 billion  after-tax) during the year ended December
31, 2018, which was record ed in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. During 2018, we also recorded  $0.3 billion  in severance
costs under our other existing separation plan.
In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business. We are modifying our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls to
accommodate the new structure and expect to transition to the new segment reporting structure during the second quarter of 2019. W e continue to report operating results to our
chief operating decision maker under our current operating segments.
Consolidated Results of Operations
In this section, we discuss  our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not includ ed in our segment results. In "Segment Results of Operations," we
review the performance of our two reportable segments in more detail.

2018  Compar ed to 2017
Consolidated revenues increased $4.8 billion, or 3.8%,  during 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to an increa se in revenues at our Wireless segment, partially offset by a
decline in revenues at our Wireline segment. Also contributing to the increase in consolidated revenues during 2018  was an increase within Corporate and other . In addition,
$0.4 billion  of the increase in consolidated revenues was attributable to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606).
Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."
Corporate and other revenues increased $1.6 billion, or 16.6%,  during 2018  compa red to 2017  primarily due to an increase of $1.7 billion in revenues within our Media
business, branded Oath, as a result of the acquisition of Y ahoo's operating business on June 13, 2017, partially of fset
by the sale of 23 customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America in our Wireline segment  (Data Center Sale) in May 2017 and other insignificant transactions
(see "Operating Results From Divested Businesses" below).
2017  Compar ed to 2016
Consolidated revenues remained consistent during 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to a decline in revenues at our Wireless segment, offset by an increase in revenues
within Corporate and other .
Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."
Corporate and other revenues increased $1.6 billion, or 20.7%,  during 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to an increa se in revenue as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's
operating business on June 13, 2017, as well as fleet service revenue growth in our telematics business. These increases were partially offset by the sale (Access Line Sale) of
our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and
high-speed internet (HSI) services and long distance voice accounts in these three states, to Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) on April 1, 2016 and the Data
Center Sale on May 1, 2017, and other insignificant transactions (see "Operating Results From Diveste d Businesses" below). During 2017 , Oath genera ted $6.0 billion in
revenues which represented approximately 64% of revenues in Corporate and Other .

Operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."
2018  Compar ed to 2017
Cost of Services
Cost of services includes the following costs directly  attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted services, network
access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems support, and costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities. Aggregate customer
care costs, which include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense.
Cost of services increased $1.3 billion, or 4.1%,  during 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to an increase in expenses as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's operating
business and an increase in rent expense at our Wireless segment and an increase in content costs associat ed with continued programming license fees and other direct costs at
our W ireline segment.
Wireless Cost of Equipment
Wireless cost of equipment increased $1.2 billion, or 5.3%,  during 2018  compared to 2017  primarily as a result of shifts to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold,
partially of fset by declines in the number of smartphones sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gener al and administrative expense includes: salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributab le to a service or product, bad debt charges, taxes other than income
taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, customer billing, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service fees, and rent and utilities for
administrative space. Also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed in "Cost of Services" above.
Selling, gener al and administrative expense increased $2.5 billion, or 8.7%,  during 2018  primarily due to a net gain on the sale of divested businesses in 2017 (see "Special
Items"), as well as an increase in severance expenses in 2018 primarily a result of the voluntary separation program for selected U.S.-based management employees (see
"Severance, pension and benefit charges (credits)" under "Special Items"). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition and integration related charges
primarily related to the acquisition of Yahoo's opera ting business (see "Special Items") and a decrease in commission expense at both our Wireless and Wireline segments
following the adoption of T opic 606.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.4 billion, or 2.6%,  during 2018  primarily due to an increase in depreciable assets at our W ireless segment.
Oath Goodwill Impairment
The goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2018 related to our Media business, branded Oath, and was a result of the company's annual goodwill impairment test performed
in the fourth quarter (see "Critical Accounting Estimates").
2017  Compar ed to 2016
Cost of Services
Cost of services increased $0.5 billion, or 1.5%,  during 2017  primar ily due to an increas e in expenses as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's operating business, an increase in
content costs associated with continued programming license fee increases and an increase in access costs as a result of the acquisition of XO Holdings' wireline business (XO)
at our Wireline segment. These increases were partia lly offset by the completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016, the Data Center Sale on May 1, 2017 and other
insignificant transactions (see "Operating Results From Divested Businesses"), the fact that we did not incur incremental costs in 2017 as a result of the union work stoppage
that commenced on April 13, 2016 and ended on June 1, 2016 (2016 W ork Stoppage).
Wireless Cost of Equipment
Wireless cost of equipment decreased $0.1 billion, or 0.4%,  during 2017 , primarily as a result of a decline in the number of smartphone and Internet units sold, substantially
offset by a shift to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gener al and administrative expense increased $0.5 billion, or 1.7%,  during  2017  primarily due to an increase in expenses as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's
operating business on June 13, 2017, acquisition and integration charges primarily in connection with the acquisition of Yahoo's operating business, product realignment
charges (see "Special Items") and an increase in expenses as a result of the acquisition of XO. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the net gain on sale of
divested businesses (see "Special Items"), a decline at our Wireless segment in sales commission expense, employee related costs, bad debt expense, non-income taxes and
advertising expense, and a decrease due to the Access  Line Sale on April 1, 2016 and the Data Center Sale on May 1, 2017, and other insignificant transactions (see "Operating
Results From Divested Businesses").
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.0 billion, or 6.4%,  during 2017  primarily due to the acquisitions of Y ahoo's operating business and XO.
Operating Results Fr om Divested Businesses
In April 2016, we completed the Access Line Sale. In May 2017, we completed the Data Center Sale. The results of operations related to these divestitures and other
insignificant transactions are included within Corporate and other for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the information
regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker . The results of operations related to these divestitures included within Corporate and other are as follows:

nm - not meaningful
The change in Other income (expense), net during  the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared to the similar period in 2017 , was primarily driven by pension and benefits
credits of $2.1 billion  recorded during 2018, compared with pension and benefit charges of approximately $0.9 billion  record ed in 2017 (see "Special Items") as well as early
debt redemption costs of $0.7 billion  recorded during 2018, compared to $2.0 billion  recorded during 2017 (see "Special Items"). The change in Other income (expense), net
during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the similar period in 2016, was primarily driven by a decrease in components of net periodic benefit cost. The change
was partially offset by early debt redemption costs of $2.0 billion , compared to $1.8 billion  recorded during 2016 (see "Special Items"), as well as a net loss on foreign
currency translation adjustments compared to a net gain in the 2016 period.

Effective interest rate 4.8% 4.7% 4.8%        
Total interest costs on debt balances increased  during 2018  primarily due to an increase in our effective interest rate. Total interest costs on debt balances increased  during 2017
primarily due to higher average debt balances.

       Increase/(Decr ease)
Years Ended December 31, 2018  2017  2016  2018 vs. 2017  2017 vs. 2016
Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 3,584  $ (9,956 ) $ 7,378  $ 13,540  nm $(17,334 ) nm
Effective income tax rate 18.3% (48.3 )% 35.2%        
nm - not meaningful
The effective  income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision (benefit) for income taxes by income before income taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2018  was
18.3%  compared to (48.3)%  for 2017 . The increase  in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the non-recurring,  non-cash income
tax benefit of $16.8 billion recorded in 2017  for the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the
enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)  on December 22, 2017. In addition, the current perio d provision for income taxes includes the tax impact of the Oath goodwill
impairment charge not deductible for tax purposes, offset by the current year reduction in the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective
January 1, 2018 under the TCJA and a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within the
Wireless business.
In December  2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 to provide guidance for companies that had not
completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB 118 allowed for a
provisional estimate of the impacts of the TCJA in our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as up to a one year measurement period that ended on
December 22, 2018, for any subsequent adjustments to such provisional estimate.  Pursuant to SAB 118, Verizon recorded a provisional estimate of $16.8 billion for the
impacts of the TCJA, primarily due to the re-
measurement of its U.S. deferred income tax liabilities at the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate incom e tax rate, with no significant impact from the transition  tax on
repatriation, the implementation of the territorial tax system, or limitations on the deduction of interest expense.  Verizon has completed its analysis of the impacts of the  TCJA ,
including analyzing the effects of any Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  and U.S. Treasury guidance issued, and state tax law changes enacted, within the maximum one year
measurement period resulting in no significant adjustments to the $16.8 billion  provisional amount previously recorded.
The effective income tax rate for 2017  was (48.3)%  compa red to 35.2%  for 2016 . The decrease  in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was
primarily due to a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit recorded in 2017 as a result of the enactment of the TCJA described above.
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the ef fective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12  to the consolidated financial statements.
Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA
Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below ,
are non-GAAP measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more
variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in
evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon’ s competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculate d by adding back interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization
expenses to net income.
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses of unconsolidated
businesses and other incom e and expense, net, as well as the effect of special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our
financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’ s evaluation of business
performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company’ s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing
impacts caused by differen ces in capital structure, taxes and depreciation policies. Further , the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to
prior period performance and trend analysis. See "Special Items" for additional information.
It is management’ s intent to provide non-GAAP finan cial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’ s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by
the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAA P. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the
corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that non-GAAP measures provide relevant and
useful information, which is used by management, investors and other users of our financial information  as well as by our management in assessing both consolidated and
segment perfo rmance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to
that of other companies.

Segment Results of Operations
We have two report able segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services, and customer
groups, respectively . We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief
operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA), which is presented below , is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an
alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial
information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital
expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by
adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income (loss). Segment EBITDA mar gin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment
operating revenues.
You can find additional information about our segments in Note 13  to the consolidated financial statements.

2018  Compared to 2017
Wireless’ total operating revenues increased $4.2 billion, or 4.8%,  during 2018  compared to 2017 , primarily as a result of increases in equipment and other revenues, partially
offset by a decrease in service revenues.
Accounts and Connections
Retail postpa id accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services.
Accounts include unlimited plans, shared data plans and corporate accounts, as well as legacy single conne ction plans and family plans. A single account may include monthly
wireless services for a variety of connected devices.
Retail connections represent our retail customer device postpaid and prepaid connections. Churn is the rate at which service to connections is terminated on a monthly basis.
Retail connections under an account may include those from smartphones and basic phones (collective ly, phones) as well as tablets and other Internet devices, including
wearables and retail IoT devices. The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth
for the industry . Retail postpaid connection net additions increased  during 2018  compared to 2017 , primarily due to an incre ase in retail postpaid connection gross additions,
including wearables.
Retail Postpaid Connections per Account
Retail postpai d connection s per account is calculated by dividing the total number of retail postpaid conne ctions by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of the end of the
period. Retail  postpaid connections per account increased  2.2%  as of December 31, 2018  compared to December 31, 2017 . The increas e in retail postpaid connections per
account is primarily due to an increase in Internet devices, including tablets and other connected devices, which represented 19.7%  of our retail postpaid connection base as of
December 31, 2018  compared to 19.0% as of December 31, 2017 . The increase in Internet devices is primarily driven by other connected devices, primarily wearables, as of
December 31, 2018  compared to December 31, 2017 .
Service Revenue
Service revenue, which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased $0.1 billion, or 0.2%,  during 2018
compared to 2017 , primarily due to a lower amount of revenue allocat ed to service revenue following the adoption of Topic 606, as well as decreased overage revenue. This
decrease was partially offset by an increase in access revenue. Overage revenue pressure began in 2017, following the introduction of unlimited pricing plans, and has subsided
now that the pace of transition to consumer plans with features that limit overages has reduced.
Customer migration to unsubsidized service pricing was driven in part by an increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program. Phone
activations under the Verizon device payment program represented approximately 78% of retail postpaid phones activated for both 2018  and 2017 . At December 31, 2018 ,
approximately 85% of our retail postpaid phone connections were on unsubsidized service pricing compared to approximately 80% at December 31, 2017 . At
December 31, 2018 , approximately 48% of our retail postpaid phone connections had a current participation in the Verizon device payment program compared to
approximately 49% at December 31, 2017 . The pace of migration to unsubsidized price plans is approaching steady state, as the majority of customers are on such plans at
December 31, 2018 .
Service revenue plus recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, which represents the total value invoiced from our wireless
connections, increased $1.5 billion, or 2.0%, during 2018  compared to 2017 .
Retail postpai d ARPA (the average service revenue per account from retail postpaid accounts), which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the
Verizon device payment program, decreased  1.1%  during 2018  compared to 2017 , as a result of a lower amount of revenue allocated to service revenue following the adoption
of Topic 606, partially offset by an increase in service revenue driven by customers shifting to higher access plans. Retail postpaid I-ARP A (the average service revenue per
account from retail postpaid accounts plus recurring device payment plan billings), which represents the monthly recurring value received on a per account basis from our retail
postpaid accounts, increased  1.4%  during 2018  compa red to 2017 . This increas e was driven by an increase in recurring device payment plan billings, partially offset by a
decline in service revenue, primarily as a result of a lower amount of revenue allocated to service revenue following the adoption of T opic 606.
Equipment Revenue
Equipment revenue increased $3.4 billion, or 17.8%,  during 2018  compared to 2017 , as a result of a shift to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold and a higher amount
of revenue allocated to equipment revenue following the adoption of Topic 606. See Notes 1 and 2 to the consol idated financ ial statements for additional information. These
increases were partially of fset by overall declines in device sales.
Other Revenue
Other revenue includes non-service revenues such as regulatory fees, cost recovery surchar ges, revenues associated with our device protection package, sublease rentals and
financing revenue. Other revenue increased $1.0 billion, or 17.4%,  during 2018  compared to 2017 , primarily due to volume and rate-driven increases in revenues related to our
device protection package.
2017  Compared to 2016
Wireless’ total operating revenues decreased $1.7 billion, or 1.9%,  during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily as a result of a decline in service revenues, partially offset by an
increase in equipment revenues.
Accounts and Connections
Retail postpai d connection net additions decreased  8.9%  during 2017  compared to 2016 , prima rily due to an increase in disconnects of Inter net devices, partially offset by a
decline in phone disconnects.
Retail Postpaid Connections per Account
Retail postpaid connections per account increased  2.0%  as of December 31, 2017  compared to December 31, 2016 , prima rily due to an increase in Internet devices, including
tablets and other connected devices, which represented 19.0%  of our retail postpaid connection base as of December 31, 2017  compared to 18.3%  as of December 31, 2016 .
Service Revenue
Service revenue, which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased $3.5 billion, or 5.2%,  during 2017
compared to 2016 , primarily due to lower postpaid service revenue, including decreased overage revenue and decreased access revenue. Overage revenue pressure was
primarily related to the introduction of unlimited pricing plans in 2017 and the ongoing migration to the pricing plans introduced in 2016 that feature safety mode and
carryover data. Service revenue was also negatively impacted as a result of the ongoing customer migration to plans with unsubsidized service pricing.
Customer migration to unsubsidized service pricing was driven in part by an increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program. For
2017 , phone activations under the Verizon device payment program represented approximately 78% of retail postp aid phones activated compared to appro ximately 77% during
2016 . At December 31, 2017 , approximately 80% of our retail postpaid phone connections were on unsubsidized service pricing compared to approx imately 67% at
December 31, 2016 . At December 31, 2017 , approximately 49% of our retail postpaid phone connections participate d in the Verizon device payment program compared  to
approximately 46% at December 31, 2016 .
Service revenue plus recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, which represents the total value invoiced from our wireless
connections, decreased $0.6 billion, or 0.8%, during 2017  compared to 2016 .
Retail postpaid ARP A, which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the V erizon device payment program, decreased  5.8%  during 2017  compared to
2016  as a result of customer migration to plans with unsubsidized service pricing, including our new price plans launched during 2016, which feature safety mode and
carryover data, and the introduction of unlimited data plans in 2017 . Retail postpaid I-ARP A, which represents the monthly recurring value received on a per account basis
from our retail postpaid accounts, decreased  0.8%  during 2017  compared to 2016 . The decreas e was driven by service revenue decline, partially offset by increasing recurring
device payment plan billings.
Equipment Revenue
Equipment revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 7.8%,  during 2017  compared to 2016 , as a result of an increase in the Verizon device payment program take rate and an increase
in the price of devices, partially of fset by an overall decline in device sales.
Other Revenue
Other revenue increased $0.4 billion, or 8.1%,  during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily due to a $0.3 billion increase in financing revenues from our device payment program
and a $0.2 billion volume-driven increase in revenues related to our device protection package.

Cost of Services
Cost of servic es increased $0.4 billion, or 4.1%,  during 2018  compared to 2017 , primarily due to higher rent expense as a result of adding capacity to the network to support
demand, as well as new pricing and a volume-driven  increase in costs related to the device protection package offered to our customers. Partially offsetting these increases
were decreases in costs related to roaming and long distance.
Cost of services decreased $0.1 billion, or 1.6%,  during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily due to decreases in costs related to roaming, long distance and cost of data. Partially
offsetting these decreases were higher rent expense as a result of an increase in macro and small cell sites supporting network capacity expansion and densification, as well as a
volume-driven increase in costs related to the device protection package of fered to our customers.
Cost of Equipment
Cost of equipment increased $1.2 billion, or 5.3%,  during 2018  compared to 2017 , primarily as a result of shifts to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold, partially of fset
by declines in the number of smartphones sold.
Cost of equipment decreased $0.1 billion, or 0.4%,  during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily as a result of a decline in the number of smartphone and Internet units sold,
substantially of fset by a shift to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and admin istrative expense decreased $1.3 billion, or 7.1%,  during 2018  compa red to 2017 , primarily due to a $1.2 billion decline in sales commission
expense, as well as a declin e of approximately $0.1 billion in employee related costs, primarily due to lower headcount and a decrease in bad debt expense. The decline in sales
commission expense durin g 2018  compa red to 2017 , was driven by decreased selling-related costs primarily arising from the deferral of commission costs following the
adoption of T opic 606.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $1.0 billion, or 5.3%,  during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily due to a $0.6 billion decline in sales commission expense
as well as a decline of approximately $0.2 billion in employee related costs primarily due to lower headcount, as well as a decline in bad debt expense, non-income taxes and
advertising expense. The decline in sales commission expense was driven by an increase in the proportion of activations under the Verizon device payment program, which has
a lower commission per unit than activations under traditional fixed-term service plans, as well as an overall decline in activations.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.3 billion, or 3.6%,  during 2018  compared to 2017 , and increased $0.2 billion, or 2.3%,  during 2017  compared to 2016 ,
primarily driven by an increase in depreciable assets.

Wireline
In 2017, Verizon reorganiz ed the customer groups within its Wireline segment. Previously , the customer groups in the Wireline segment consisted of Mass Markets (which
included Consumer Retail and Small Business subgro ups), Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale. Pursuant to the reorganization, there are now four customer groups within
the Wireline segment: Consumer Markets, which includes the customers previously included in Consum er Retail; Enterprise Solutions, which includes the large business
customers, including multinational corporations, and federal government customers previously included in Global Enterprise; Partner Solutions, which includes the customers
previously included in Global Wholesale; and Busin ess Markets, a new customer group, which includes U.S.-based small business customers previously included in Mass
Markets and U.S.-based medium business customers, state and local government customers, and educational institutions previously included in Global Enterprise.
The operating  revenues from XO are included in the Wireline segment results beginning in February 2017 , following the completion of the acquisition, and are included with
the Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets customer groups.
The operating results and statistics for all periods presented below exclude the results of the Data Cente r Sale in 2017 and other insignificant transactions (see "Operating
Results From  Divested Businesses"). The results were  adjusted to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief

(1) As of end of period
Wireline’ s revenues decreased $0.9 billion, or 3.0%,  during 2018  compared to 2017 , primarily due to decreases in traditional voice, network and HSI services as a result of
technology substitution and competition as well as decreases in demand for traditional linear video within  our customer groups. The year ended 2018  includes one additional
month of operating revenues from XO compared to the similar period in 2017 .
Fios revenues were $11.9 billion , during 2018  compared to $11.7 billion  during 2017 . During 2018 , our Fios Internet subscriber base increased  by 3.7% and our Fios Video
subscriber base decreased  by 3.6%, compared to 2017 , reflec ting increased dema nd in higher broadband speeds and the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-
top of ferings.
Service reven ues attributab le to voice, Fios Video and HSI services declined, during 2018  compared to 2017 , related to declines of 8.5% , 3.6%  and 19.4%  in connections,
respectively . The decline in voice connections is prim arily a result of competition and technology substitution with wireless, competing voice over Internet Protocol (IP) and
cable telepho ny service. The decline in video connec tions continues to result from the shift in traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings. The increase in Fios Internet
connections was driven by the continuing demand for higher speed Internet connectivity which of fset the decline in HSI connections.
Consumer Markets
Consumer Markets operations provide broadband Internet and video services (including Fios Internet, Fios V ideo and HSI services) and local and long distance voice services
to residential subscribers.
2018  Compar ed to 2017
Consumer Markets revenues decreased $0.2 billion, or 1.5%,  during 2018  compared to 2017 , due to the continued decline of Fios Video, voice and HSI services, partially
offset by increases in Fios Internet revenues due to subscriber growth and higher value customer mix.
Consumer Fios revenues increased $0.2 billion , or 1.5% , during 2018  compa red to 2017 . Fios represented approximately 88% of Consumer Markets revenue during 2018
compared to approximately 85% during 2017 .
The decline in voice service revenues was primarily due to an 8.5%  declin e in voice connecti ons resulting primarily from competition and technology substitution with
wireless and competing voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and cable telephony services. Total voice conn ections include traditional switched access lines in service, as well as
Fios digital voice connections.
2017  Compar ed to 2016
Consumer Markets revenues increased 0.2%,  during 2017  compared to 2016 , due to increa ses in Fios revenues as a result of subsc riber growth for Fios Internet services fueled
by the introduction of gigabit speed data services, as well as higher pay-per -view sales due to marquee events during the third quarter of 2017 , partially offset by the continued
decline of voice service and HSI revenues.
Consumer Fios revenues increased $0.4 billion , or 3.7% , during 2017  compa red to 2016 . Fios represented approximately 85% of Consumer Markets revenue during 2017
compared to approximately 82% during 2016 .
The decline in voice service revenues was primarily due to an 8.0%  decline in voice connections resulting primarily from competition and technology substitution with
wireless and competing VoIP and cable telephony services. Total voice connections include tradition al switched access lines in service, as well as Fios digital voice
connections.

Cost of Services
Cost of services decreased $0.2 billion, or 1.2%,  during 2018  compared to 2017 , primarily due to decrease s in personnel costs, cost of equipment and access costs, which were
partially of fset by increases in content costs associated with continued increases in the cost of programming license fees and other direct costs.
Cost of services decreased $0.4 billion, or 2.3%,  during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily due to the fact that we did not incur increm ental costs in 2017 that were incurred in
2016 as a result of the 2016  Work Stoppage, as well as a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit costs primarily driven by collective bargaining agreements ratified in

Severance, Pension and Benefits Charges (Credits)
During 2018,  we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.1 billion  in accordanc e with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period
in whic h they occur . The pension and benefits remeasurement credits of $2.3 billion , which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of
income, were primarily driven by an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans
from a weighted-average of 3.7%  at December 31, 2017 to a weighted-average of 4.4%  at December 31, 2018 ( $2.6 billion ), and mortality and other assumption adjustments of
$1.7 billion , $1.6 billion  of which related to health care claims and trend adjustments, offset by the difference between our estima ted return on assets of 7.0%  and our actual
return on assets of (2.7)%  ($1.9 billion ). The credits were partial ly offset by $0.2 billion  due to the effects of participants retiring under the voluntary separation program.
During 2018, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $2.2 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense, primarily driven by the voluntary separation
program for select U.S.-ba sed management employees and other headcount reduction initiatives, which resulted in a severance charge of $1.8 billion  ($1.4 billion  after-tax),
and $0.3 billion  in severance costs recorded under other existing separation plans.
During 2017,  we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges of $1.4 billion , exclusive of acquisition related severance charges, in accordance with our
accounting policy to recog nize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur . The pension  and benefits remeasurement charges of approximately $0.9 billion ,
which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our conso lidated statem ents of income, were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to
determine the current year liabilities of our pension and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 4.2%  at December 31, 2016 to a weighted-average of 3.7%  at
December 31, 2017 ($2.6 billion ). The charges were partially offset by the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0%  and our actual return on assets of 14.0%
($1.2 billion ), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven  by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2017) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.2 billion ) and other
assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion ). As part of these charges, we also recorded severance costs of $0.5 billion  under our existing separation plans, which were recorded in
Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
During 2016,  we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges of $2.9 billion  in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses
in the period in which they occur . The pension and benefits remeasurement charges of $2.5 billion , which were recorded in Other income (expense), net, in our conso lidated
statements of income, were  primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determi ne the current year liabilities of our pension and other postretirement
benefit plans from a weigh ted-average of 4.6%  at December  31, 2015 to a weighted-average of 4.2%  at December  31, 2016 ($2.1 billion ), upda ted health care trend cost
assumptions ($0.9 billion ), the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0%  and our actual return on assets of 6.0%  ($0.2 billion ) and other assumption
adjustments ( $0.3 billion ). These charges were partially offset by a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2016) issued
by the Society of Actuarie s ($0.5 billion ) and lower negotiated prescription drug pricing ($0.5 billion ). As part of these charges, we also recorded severa nce costs of $0.4
billion  under our existing separation plans, which were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
The net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges during 2016 were comprised of a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.2 billion  measu red as of March 31,
2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in one of our define d benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension and benefits remeasurement
charge of $0.8 billion  measu red as of April 1, 2016 related to curtailment s in three  of our defined benefit pension and one of our other postretirement plans, a net pre-tax
pension and benefits remeasurement charge of $2.7 billion  measured as of May 31, 2016 in two defined benefit pension plans and three  other postretirement benefit plans as a
result of our accounting for the contractual healthcare caps and bar gained for changes, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement char ge of $0.1 billion  measured as of May 31, 2016
related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in three  of our define d benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.6
billion  measured as of August 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in five of our define d benefit pension plans, and a net pre-tax
pension and benefits credi t of $1.9 billion  as a result of our fourth quarter remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement assets and liabilities based on updated
actuarial assumptions.
Due to the presentation of the other components of net periodic benefit cost, we recognize a portion of the pension and benefits charges (credits) in Other income (expense),
net, in our conso lidated statements of income. The Conso lidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA discussion (see "Consolidated Results of Operations") excludes the amount of the severance, pension and benefits charges (credits) recorded
in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
Gain on Spectrum License Transactions
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed a license exchange transaction with affiliates of T-Mobile USA Inc. (T-Mobile USA) to exchange certain Advanced Wireless
Services (AWS) and Personal Communication Servic es (PCS) spectrum licenses. As a result of this agreement, we received $0.4 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum  licenses at
fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.1 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31,
2017.
During the first quarter of 2017, we completed a license exchange transaction with affiliates of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. As a
result of this non-cash exchange, we received $1.0 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.1 billion  in Selling, general and
administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
During the first quarter of 2016, we completed a license exchange transaction with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. As a result of this
non-cash exch ange, we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.1 billion in Selling, general
and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The net gain on the sale of divested businesses of $1.0 billion  recorded during 2016 related to the Access Line Sale. The gain recorded included a $0.5 billion pension and
postretirement benefit curtailment gain due to the elimination of the accrual of pension and other postretirement benefits for some or all future services of a significant number
of employees covered in three of our defined benefit pension plans and one of our other postretirement benefit plans.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA discussion
(see "Consolidated Results of Operations") excludes the gains on the Data Center Sale and other insignificant transactions and the Access Line Sale described above.
Early Debt Redemption Costs
During 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recorded losses on early debt redemptions of $0.7 billion , $2.0 billion , and $1.8 billion  respectively .
 
We recognize losses on early debt redemptions in Other income (expense), net  in our consolidated statements of income. See Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information related to our early debt redemptions.
Operating Environment and Trends
The industrie s that we operate in are highly competitive, which we expect to continue particularly as traditional and non-traditional service providers seek increased market
share. We believe that our high-quality customer base and networks differentiate us from our competi tors and give us the ability to plan and manage through changing
economic and competitive  conditions. We remain focused on executing on the fundamentals of the business: maintaining a high-quality customer base, delivering strong
financial and operating results and strengthening our balance sheet. We will continue to invest for growth, which we believe is the key to creating value for our shareholders.
We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance while building momentum for our 5G network. We believe that our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments
in our Intelligent Edge Network that enable ef ficiencies throughout our core infrastructure and deliver flexibility to meet customer requirements at the edge of the network.
The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry . We expect future
revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer relationships, increasing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and
services and increasing the penetration of other connected devices including wearables, tablets and IoT devices. We expect 5G technology will provide a significant
opportunity for growth in the industry in 2020 and beyond. Current and potential competitors in the U.S. wireless market include other national wireless service providers,
various regional wireless service providers, wireless resellers and cable companies, as well as other communications and technology companies providing wireless products
and services.
Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we
believe they will regard as the best available value for the price. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow , we and other wireless service providers are offering
service plans at competitiv e prices that include voice services, data access and text messaging, in some cases on an unlimited basis.  These service offerings will vary from time
to time as part of promotional of fers or in response to market circumstances.
Many wireless servi ce providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, also offer device payment options, which provide consumers with the ability to pay for their device over
a perio d of time, and devic e leasing arrangements.  We expect future service revenue growth opportunit ies to arise from increased access revenue as customers shift to higher
access plans, as well as from increased connections per account. Future service revenue growth opportun ities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services
and increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our network and services and the development of new ecosystems.
Current and potential competitors to our Wireline businesses include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite
television companies, Internet service providers, over -the-top providers and other companies that of fer network services and managed enterprise solutions.
In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service
providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large
contracts to provide integra ted services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong marke t presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all
of which contribute to intensifying competition that may af fect our future revenue growth.
Despite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our Wireline segment by providing network reliability , offering consumers
products, including broadband Internet access, digita l television and voice services, offering business and government customers more robust IP products and services, and
accelerating our IoT strategies.
The online advertising market continues to evolve as online users are migrating from traditional desktop to mobile and multiple-device usage. Also, there is a continued shift
towards programmatic advertising which presents opportunities to connect online advertisers with the appropriate online users in a rapid environment. Our Media business
competes with other online search engines, advertising platforms, digital video services and social networ ks. We are experiencing pressure from search and desktop usage and
believe the pressure in these sectors will continue. We will implement initiatives to realize syner gies across all of our media assets and build services around our core content
pillars to diversify revenue and return to growth.
We will also continue to focus on cost ef ficiencies to attempt to of fset adverse impacts from unfavorable economic conditions and competitive pressures.
2019 Connection Trends
In our Wireless segment, we expect to continue to attract and maintain the loyalty of high-quality retail postpaid customers, capitalizing on demand for data services and
bringing our customers new ways of using wireless services in their daily lives. We expect that future connection growth will be driven by smartphones, tablets and other
connected devices such as wearables. We believe the overall customer experience of matching the unlimited plan with our high-quality network continues to attract and retain
higher value retail postpaid connections, contributes to continued increases in the penetration of data services and helps us remain competitive with other wireless carriers. We
expect to manage churn by providing a consistent, reliable experience on our wireless network and focusi ng on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing
and better execution in our distribution channels.
In our Wireline segment, we have experienced conti nuing access line losses as customers have disconn ected both primary and secondary lines and switched to alternative
technologies such as wireless, VoIP and cable for voice and data services. We expect to continue to experience access line losses as customers continue to switch to alternate
technologies. We expect to continue to grow our Fios Internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas. In Fios video, the business
continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market. We expect to expand our existing business through our Intelligent Edge Network, our
multi-use platform.
2019 Operating Revenue Trends
In our Wireless segment, we expect to see a continuation of the service revenue trends from 2018 as customers shift to higher access plans and increase the number of ways
they connect with our network and services. Equipme nt revenues are largely dependent on wireless device  sales volumes, the mix of devices, promotions and upgrade cycles,
which are subject to device lifecycles, iconic device launches and competition within the wireless industry .
In our Wireline segment, we expect segment revenu e pressures as growth in our high-quality fiber-base d products continues to be offset by technology shifts and ongoing
secular declin es from legacy technologies and compe tition. We expect Consumer Markets revenue to experience near‑term declines to be driven by legacy core declines and
cord-cutting only partially  offset by Fios broadband growth. We expect a continued decline in core revenues for our Business Markets, Enterprise Solutions and Partner
Solutions customer offerings; however , we expect revenue growth from advanced business and fiber-based services, including the expansion of our fiber footprint, to partially ,
and in some cases fully , mitigate these declines for the customer groups.
Our Media business, Verizon Media, which operate d in 2018 under the "Oath" brand, is primarily made up of digital advertising products. We are experiencing revenue
pressure from search and desktop usage and believe the pressure in those sectors will continue. We are focused on returning to revenue growth by implementing initiatives to
realize syner gies across all of our media assets and building services around our core content pillars. W e are experiencing positive growth in mobile usage and video products.
2019 Operating Expense and Cash Flow from Operations Trends
We expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin to remain strong as we continue to undertake initiatives to reduce our overall
cost structure by improvin g productivity and gaining efficiency in our operations throughout the business in 2019  and beyond.  Business Excellence initiatives include the
adoption of the zero-based  budgeting methodology , driving capital efficiencies from network restructuring, evolving our Information Technology strategy and offering the
voluntary separation program. The goal of the Business Excellence initiative is to take $10 billion of cumulative cash outflows out of the business over four years, beginning
with 2018. As part of this initiative, we are focusing on both operating expenses and capital expenditures.  Our Business Excellence initiatives have produced cumulative cash
savings of $2.3 billion in 2018 from a mix of capital and operational expenditure activities. The progra m remains on track to achieve our goal. Expenses related to newly
acquired businesses and programs funded through the reinvestment of program savings are expected to apply of fsetting pressures to our mar gins.
The implementation of Topic 606, resulted in the deferral of commission expense in both our Wireless and Wireline segments. In 2019 and 2020, we expect a smaller benefit
from the adoption of the standard due to the deferral of commissions costs as compared to 2018.
Due to the implementation of Accounting Standard Codification Topic 842 related to leasing on January 1, 2019, we estimate the impact to operating expense for the full year
2019 will be an increase due to certain initial direct costs that can no longer be deferred under the new accounting guidance.
We create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable growth, thereby
increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In addition, we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to shareholders.
Verizon’ s Board of Directors increased the Company’ s quarterly dividend by 2.1%  during 2018, making this the twelfth consecutive year in which we have raised our dividend.
Our goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help us to grow the business,
strengthen our balance sheet, acquire spectrum licenses (see "Cash Flows from Investing Activities"), pay dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back
shares of our outstanding common stock (see "Cash Flows from Financing Activities").
Capital Expenditures
Our 2019  capita l progr am includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding our core networks, adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE
network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and deploying our 5G network , transforming our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network
while reducing the cost to deliver services to our customers and pursuing other opportunities to drive operating efficiencies. We expect that the new network architecture will
simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology , deliver high-speed Fios broadband to
homes and businesses, and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market. The level and the timing of the Company’ s capital expenditures within these broad
categories can vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors outside of our control, such as material weather events. Capital expenditures for 2019  are expected  to be in
the range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion, including the continued investment in our 5G network. Capita l expenditures were $16.7 billion  in 2018  and $17.2 billion  in 2017 .
We believe that we have significant discretion over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures on a Company-wide basis as we are not subject to any agreement that
would require significant capital expenditures on a designated schedule or upon the occurrence of designated events.

We use the net cash generated from our operations to fund network expansion and modernization, service and repay external financing, pay dividends, invest in new businesses
and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstan ding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary , from external financing
arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements. We expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily
through intern ally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities or to maintain an appropriate capital
structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally , and are invested to maintain principal and provide
liquidity . See "Market Risk" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.
Our available external financing arrangements include an active commercial paper program, credit available under credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, vendor
financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other capital market securities that are privately-placed or offered
overseas. In addition, we monetize our device payment plan agreement receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-18 and ASU 2016-15. As required by ASU 2016-18, we included restricted cash in the statement of cash flows for all periods
presented. In addition, as required by ASU 2016-15, we retrospectively reclassified approximately $0.6 billion of collections of deferred purchase price related to off-balance
sheet securitization from Cash flows from operating activities to Cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December
31, 2017, and $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities
Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operati ng activities during 2018  increased by $10.0 billion  primarily due to
an improvement in working capital which includes a decrease in cash income taxes, an increase of $4.0 billion in earnings, and a lower amount of discretionary contributions to
qualified employee benefit plans in 2018 compared to 2017. We made $1.7 billion and $3.4 billion in discretionary employee benefits contributions during 2018 and 2017,
respectively , primarily to our defined benefit pension plan. As a result of the discretionary pension contributions in 2018 and a $0.3 billion discretionary contribution in January
2019, we expect that there will be no required pension funding until 2024, which will benefit future cash flows. Further , the funded status of our qualified pension plan
improved as a result of the contributions.
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2017  increased by $2.6 billion  primarily due to an increase in earnings and changes in working capital, partially offset by our
discretionary contributions  to qualified pension plans of $3.4 billion (approximately $2.1 billion, net of tax benefit) and the change in the method in which we monetize device
payment plan receivables, as discussed below .
During 2016, we changed the strategic method by which we monetize device payment plan receivables from sales of device payment plan receivables, which were recorded
within cash flows provided by operating activities, to asset-backed debt transactions that are recorded in cash flows from financing activities. During 2016, we received
proceeds related to sales of wireless device payme nt plan agreement receivables of approximately $2.0 billion. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information . During 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , we received proceeds from asset-backed debt transactions of approximately  $4.8 billion , $4.3 billion  and $5.0 billion ,
respectively . See Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements and "Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities" for additional information.
Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities
Capital Expenditur es
Capital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to facilitate the intro duction of new products and services, enhance responsiveness to
competitive challenges, maintain the existing infrastructure and increase the operating ef ficiency and productivity of our networks.
Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were as follows:
(dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2018  2017  2016
Wireless $ 8,486  $ 10,310  $ 11,240
Wireline 6,255  5,339  4,504
Other 1,917  1,598  1,315
 $ 16,658  $ 17,247  $ 17,059
Total as a percentage of revenue 12.7% 13.7% 13.5%
Capital expenditures decreased at Wireless in 2018  primarily due to capital efficiencies from our business excellence initiatives. Capital expenditures increased at Wireline in
2018 , primarily due to an increase in investments to support multi-use fiber assets, which support the densification of our 4G LTE network and a continued focus on 5G
technology deployment. Our investments primarily related to network equipment to support the business. Capital expenditures decreased at Wireless in 2017  primarily due to
the shift in investments to fiber assets. Capital expen ditures increased at Wireline in 2017  primarily as a result of an increase in investments to support our multi-use fiber
deployment.
Acquisitions
During 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , we invested $1.4 billion , $0.6 billion  and $0.5 billion , respectively , in acquisitions of wireless licenses. During 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , we also
invested $0.2 billion , $5.9 billion  and $3.8 billion , respectively , in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired.
In January 2018, Verizon acquired NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink) from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO for approximately $0.5 billion , subject to certain adjustments,
of which $0.3 billion , an option exercise price to acquire NextLink, was prepaid in the first quarter of 2017. The option exercise price represented the fair value of the option.
The remaining cash consideration was paid at the closing of the transaction. The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction is being used for our 5G technology deployment.
In February 2018, Verizon  acquired Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path) , a holder of millimeter wave spectrum configured for 5G wireless services for total
consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion , which  was primarily settled with Verizon shares but also included transaction costs payable in cash
of approximately $0.7 billion , consis ting primarily of a fee paid to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction is being
used for our 5G technology deployment.
In February 2017, Verizon acquired XO, which owne d and operated one of the largest fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks, for total cash consideration of approximately $1.5
billion , of which  $0.1 billion  was paid in 2015.
In June 2017, V erizon acquired Y ahoo's operating business for cash consideration of approximately $4.7 billion , including cash acquired of $0.2 billion .
In December 2017, Verizo n purchased certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from WideOpenW est, Inc. (WOW!) for cash consideration of approximately
$0.2 billion .
In July 2016, we acquired T elogis, Inc. (T elogis), a global cloud-based mobile enterprise management business, for $0.9 billion of cash consideration.
In November 2016, we acquired Fleetmatics Group PLC (Fleetmatics), a leading global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions, for $60.00 per ordinary
share in cash. The aggregate mer ger consideration was approximately $2.5 billion, including cash acquired of $0.1 billion.
During 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , we acquired various other businesses and investments for cash consideration that was not significant.
See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for additional information on our acquisitions.
Dispositions
During 2017,  we received net cash proceeds of $3.5 billion in connection with the Data Center Sale on May 1, 2017. We also completed other insignificant transactions during
2017.
During 2016, we received cash proceeds of $9.9 billion in connection with the completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016.
See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for additional information on our dispositions.
Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities
We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility
resulting from changes in market conditions. During 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , net cash used in financing activities was $15.4 billion , $6.2 billion  and $13.4 billion , respectively .
2018
During 2018 , our net cash used in financing activities of $15.4 billion  was primarily driven by:
• $14.6 billion  used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations, which included $3.6 billion  used for
prepayments and repayments of asset-backed long-term borrowings; and
• $9.8 billion  used for dividend payments.
These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $10.8 billion , which included $4.8 billion  of proceeds from our asset-backed debt
transactions.
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-T erm Borrowings
At December 31, 2018 , our total debt decreased to $113.1 billion  as compared to $117.1 billion  at December 31, 2017 . Our ef fective interest rate was 4.8%  and 4.7%  during the
years ended December 31, 2018  and 2017 , respectively . The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest
rates do not have a material ef fect on our interest payments. See also "Market Risk" and Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
At December 31, 2018 , approximately $17.1 billion  or 15.1%  of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily the
Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on a majority of our foreig n denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal
payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.
Verizon may continue to repurchase debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates in the future throu gh open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender
offers, exchange of fers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as V erizon may from time to time determine for cash or other consideration.
Other , net
Other , net financing activit ies during 2018  includ ed early debt redemption costs, see "Special Items" for additional information, as well as cash paid on debt exchanges and
derivative-related transactions.
Dividends
The Verizon Board of Directors assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such factors as long-term growth opportunities, internal
cash requirements and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2018 , the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 2.1%  to $0.6025  from
$0.5900  per share in the prior period. This is the twelfth consecutive year that V erizon’ s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend increase.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2018 , we paid $9.8 billion  in dividends.
2017
During 2017 , our net cash used in financing activities of $6.2 billion  was primarily driven by:
• $24.2 billion  used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations, which included $0.4 billion  used for
prepayments of asset-backed long-term borrowings; and
• $9.5 billion  used for dividend payments.
These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $32.0 billion, which included $4.3 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt
transactions.
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-T erm Borrowings
At December 31, 2017 , our total debt increased to $117.1 billion  as compared to $108.1 billion  at December  31, 2016. Our effective interest rate was 4.7%  and 4.8% during the
years ended December 31, 2017  and 2016, respectively . The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest
rates did not have a material ef fect on our interest payments. See also "Market Risk" and Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
At December 31, 2017 , approximate ly $18.0 billion or 15.3% of the aggrega te principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily the
Euro and British Pound Sterling. W e have entered into cross currency swaps on a majority of our foreign
denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market
Risk" for additional information.
Other , net
Other , net financing activi ties during 2017 , included early debt redemption costs. See "Special Items" for additional information related to the early debt redemption costs

Dividends
During the third quarter of 2017 , the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 2.2% to $0.5900 from $0.5775 per share in the prior period.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2017 , we paid $9.5 billion in dividends.
2016
During 2016 , our net cash used in financing activities of $13.4 billion  was primarily driven by:
• $19.2 billion  used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations; and
• $9.3 billion  used for dividend payments.
These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $18.0 billion, which included $5.0 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt
transactions.
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-T erm Borrowings
At December  31, 2016 , our total debt decreased to $108.1 billion  as compared to $109.7 billion at December 31, 2015. Our effective interest rate was 4.8% during the year
ended December 31, 2016 . The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest rates did not have a material
effect on our interest payments. See also "Market Risk" for additional information.
At December 31, 2016 , appro ximately $11.6 billio n or 10.7% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consis ted of foreign denominated debt, primarily the
Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on a majority of our foreig n denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal
payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.

Dividends
During the third quarter of 2016 , the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 2.2% to $0.5775 from $0.565 per share in the prior period.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2016 , we paid $9.3 billion in dividends.
Asset-Backed Debt
As of December 31, 2018 , the carrying  value of our asset-backed debt was $10.1 billion . Our asset-ba cked debt includes notes (the Asset-Ba cked Notes) issued to third-party
investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt
bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively , the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection
with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, we transfer device payment plan agreement receivables from Cellco Partnership (Cellco) and
certain other affiliates of Verizon (collectively , the Originators) to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt.
Verizon entiti es retain the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other
related payments and expenses.
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment plan agreement
receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses
related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed
debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’ s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied.
The Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to Verizon with
respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, V erizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and
the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreem ent receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into
segregated accounts. Depo sits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other , and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-
backed debt issued and the assets securing this debt are included in our consolidated balance sheets.
During September 2016 and May 2017, we entered into loan agreements through an ABS Entity with a number of financial institutions. Under these ABS loan agreements, we
have the right to prepay all or a portion of the loans at any time without penalty , but in certain cases, with breakage costs. The two year revolving period of the two loan
agreements ended in September 2018. In 2018, we made a $1.5 billion  drawdown and an aggregate amount of $3.0 billion  of prepayments and repayments . We made a $0.4
billion prepayment in December 2017.
In May 2018, we entered into a second device payment plan agreement financing facility with a number of financial institutions (2018 ABS Financing Facility). Under the
terms of the 2018 ABS Financing Facility , the financi al institutions made advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement receivables of business
customers for proceeds of $0.5 billion .
Credit Facilities
In April 2018, we amended our $9.0 billion  credit facility to increase the capacity to  $9.5 billion  and extend its maturity to April 4, 2022. As of December 31, 2018, the unused
borrowing capacity under our $9.5 billion  credit facility  was approximately $9.4 billion . The credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain
specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. We use the credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit
and for general corporate purposes.
In March 2016, we entere d into a $1.0 billion  credit facility insured by Eksportkreditnamnden Stockholm, Sweden, the Swedish export credit agency . As of December 31,
2018, the outstanding balance was $0.7 billion . We used this credit facility to finance network equipment-related purchases.
In July 2017, we entered into credit facilities insured by various export credit agencies providing us with the ability to borrow up to $4.0 billion  to finance equipment-related
purchases. The facilities have borrowings available, portions of which extend through October 2019, contingent upon the amount of eligible equipment-related purchases that
we make. During 2018, we drew down $3.0 billion  from these facilities , and $2.8 billion  remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, we drew down an
additional $0.4 billion  from these facilities.
Common Stock
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the years ended December 31, 2018 ,
2017  and 2016 , we issued 3.5 million , 2.8 million  and 3.5 million  common shares from T reasury stock, respectively , which had an insignificant aggregate value.
In March 2017, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million  shares of the Company's common stock. The program will
terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches  100 million , or at the close of business on February 28, 2020, whichever is sooner . The program permits
Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. There were no repurchases of
common stock during 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Credit Ratings
Verizon’ s credit ratings did not change in 2018 , 2017  or 2016 .
Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendat ions to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating or ganization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Covenants
Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely
fashion, pay taxes, maintai n insurance with responsib le and reputable insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial
transactions, maintain our properties, provide financ ial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and consolidations, and other
similar covenants.
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.
Change In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018  totaled $2.7 billion , a $0.7 billion  increase  compared to Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017  primarily as a
result of the factors discussed above. Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017  totaled $2.1 billion , a $0.8 billion  decrease  compared to Cash and cash equivalents
at December 31, 2016  primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.
Restricted cash at December 31, 2018  totaled $1.2 billion , a $0.4 billion  increase  compared to restricted cash at December 31, 2017  primarily due to cash collections on the
device payme nt plan agreement receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Restricted cash at December 31, 2017  totaled $0.8
billion , a $0.5 billion  increase  compared to restricted cash at December 31, 2016  primarily related to cash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables that
are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GA AP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete
understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities. We
believe it is a more conserv ative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it
does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations
or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to Free cash flow:
 (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2018  2017  2016
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 34,339  $ 24,318  $ 21,689
Less Capital expenditures (including capitalized software) 16,658  17,247  17,059
Free cash flow $ 17,681  $ 7,071  $ 4,630
The changes in free cash flow during 2018 , 2017  and 2016  were a result of the facto rs described in connection  with net cash provided by operating activities and capital
expenditures. The change in free cash flow during 2018  was primarily due to an improvement in working capital which includes a decrease in cash income taxes, an increase of
$4.0 billion in earnings, and a lower amount of discretionary contributions to qualified employee benef it plans in 2018 compared to 2017. We made $1.7 billion and $3.4
billion in discretionary employee benefits contributi ons during 2018 and 2017, respectively , primarily to our defined benefit pension plan. As a result of the discretionary
pension contributions in 2018 and a $0.3 billion discretionary contribution in January 2019, we expect that there will be no required pension funding until 2024, which will
benefit future cash flows. Further , the funded status of our qualified pension plan improved as a result of the contributions. Capital expenditures decreased during 2018
compared to 2017 , primarily due to capital expenditure ef ficiencies from our Business Excellence initiatives.
The change in free cash flow during 2017  was primarily due to an increase in earnings and changes in working capital, partially offset by our discretionary contributions to
qualified pension plans of $3.4 billion (approximately $2.1 billion, net of tax benefit) and the change in the method in which we monetize device payment plan receivables, as
discussed below .
During 2016, we changed the strategic method by which we monetize device payment plan receivables from sales of device payment plan receivables, which were recorded
within cash flows provided by operating activities, to asset-backed debt transactions that are recorded in cash flows from financing activities. During 2016, we received
proceeds related to sales of wireless device payme nt plan agreement receivables of approximately $2.0 billion. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information . During 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , we received proceeds from asset-backed debt transactions of approximately  $4.8 billion , $4.3 billion  and $5.0 billion ,
respectively . See Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements and "Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities" for additional information.
Employee Benefit Plan Funded Status and Contributions
Employer Contributions
We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units. During
2018 , 2017  and 2016 , contributions to our qualified pension plans were $1.0 billion , $4.0 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively . We made no contribution to our nonqualified
pension plans in 2018 , and contributed $0.1 billion in both 2017  and 2016 . In January 2019, we made a $0.3 billion  discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans.
The company’ s overall investment strategy is to achie ve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. In an
effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match cash flows
from investments with projected benefit payments. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to
as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries; however , we also expect the strategy to result in lower
asset returns. Nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately $0.1 billion  in 2019 .
Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not
have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $0.7 billion , $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2018 , 2017  and
2016 , respectively . Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $0.5 billion  in 2019 .

(1) Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements.
(2) See Note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(3) Items included in purchase  obligations are primarily commitments to purchase content and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be
used or sold in the ordinar y course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the
subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented in this table alone do
not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash position. See Note 16 to the consolidated financ ial statements for
additional information.
(4) Other long-te rm liabilities represent estimated postr etirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions. Estimated qualified pension plan contributions include
expected minimum funding contributions, which commence in 2024  based on the plan's current funded status. Estimated postretirement benefit payments include expected
future postretirement benefit payments. These estimated amounts: (1) are subject to change based on changes to assumptions and future plan performance, which could
impact the timing or amoun ts of these payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts. See Note 1 1 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information .
(5) Represents future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement for our tower transaction. See Note 6 to the consolidated finan cial statements for additi onal
information.
We are not able to make a reasonable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $2.9 billion  and related interest and penalties will be settled with the respective
taxing authorities until issues or examinations are further developed. See Note 12  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Guarantees
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telepho ne company subsidiaries as well as the debt obligations of GTE LLC, as successor in interest to GTE Corporation, that
were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003. See Note 7  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
As a result of the closing of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016, GTE Southwest Inc., Verizon California Inc. and Verizon Florida LLC are no longer wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Verizon, and the guarantees of $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of debentures and first mortgage bonds of those entities have terminated pursuant to their
terms.
In connection  with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers
pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses. See Note 16  to the consol idated financ ial statements
for additional information.
As of December 31, 2018 , letters of credit totaling approximately $0.6 billion , which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing
arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. See Note 16  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Market Risk
We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
changes in investment, equity and commodity prices  and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of
derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward  starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold
derivatives for trading purposes.
It is our gener al policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing
exposure to various marke t risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to
protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely
eliminate the ef fect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings.
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support
annex (CSA)  agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. Our CSA agreements entered into prior to the fourth quarter of 2017 generally require collateralized
arrangements with our counterparties in connection with uncleared derivatives. During 2017, we paid an insignificant amount of cash to extend amendments to certain of our
collateral exchange arrangements, which eliminated the requirement to post collateral for a specified period of time. Additionally , during the fourth quarter of 2017, we began
negotiating and executing new ISDA master agreeme nts and CSA agreements with our counterparties. The negotiations and executions of new agreements continued in 2018.
The newly executed CSA agreements contain rating  based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in
outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. At December 31, 2018 , we posted collateral of approximately  $0.1 billion  related to
derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Prepaid expenses  and other in our consolidated balance sheet. We did not post any
collateral at  December 31, 2017 . While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that
any such nonperformance would result in a significan t effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.  See Note 9  to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to change s in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term  debt that carries floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2018 ,
approximately 78% of the aggregate principal amou nt of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements
designated as hedges. The impact of a 100-basis-poin t change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, including our
interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges, of approximately $0.3 billion. The interest  rates on our existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by
changes to our credit ratings.
The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2018  and 2017 . The
table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield curve.
Our sensitivity analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not significantly affected by changes in market
interest rates.

Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principa lly receive fixed rates and pay variable rates based on the London
Interbank Of fered Rate, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expe nse. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure
of designated debt issuances.  At December 31, 2018 , the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was insignificant and $0.8 billion , respectively . At
December 31, 2017 , the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts were $0.1 billion  and $0.4 billion , respectively . At December 31, 2018  and 2017 , the total notional
amount of the interest rate swaps was $19.8 billion  and $20.2 billion , respectively .
Forward Starting Inter est Rate Swaps
We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on future forecasted
transactions.  At December 31, 2018 , the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $0.1 billion . At December 31, 2018 , the total notional amount of the forward starting
interest rate swaps was $4.0 billion .
Inter est Rate Caps
We also have  interest rate caps which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate
our interest exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financing Facility and Asset-Backed Note s. The fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts were
insignificant at both December 31, 2018  and 2017 . At December 31, 2018  and 2017 , the total notional value of these contracts was $2.2 billion  and $2.8 billion , respectively .
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency . The translation of incom e statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into
U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and
losses on foreign currency  transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income in Other income (expense), net. At December 31, 2018 , our primary translation
exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Y en.
Cross Curr ency Swaps
We have entered into cross currency swaps designate d as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Australian Dollar -denominated cash
flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.  The fair value of the asset
of these contracts was $0.2 billion  and $0.5 billion  at December 31, 2018  and 2017 , respectively . At December 31, 2018  and 2017 , the fair value of the liability of these
contracts was $0.5 billion  and insignificant respectively . At both December 31, 2018  and 2017 , the total notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $16.6 billion .
Foreign Exchange Forwards
We also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We enter into British
Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of
international subsidiaries.  At December 31, 2018 , the total notional amount of the foreign exchange forwards was $0.6 billion.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Critical Accounting Estimates
A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements is as follows:
•Wireless licenses and Goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wirele ss licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible
assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter , unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or
changes in circumstances during an interim period providing impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent
appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologie s in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair
value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by natur e, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is
possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing  and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market
participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates. Significant and
adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units.
Wireless Licenses
The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $94.1 billion  as of December 31, 2018 . We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting,
as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize
certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless  communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors
that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses.
In 2018 , our quantitative impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate  wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test
date.
In 2017 and 2016, we perfo rmed a qualitative impairm ent assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than
the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of Wireless, macroeconomic conditions
(including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin projections), the projected
financial performance of W ireless, as well as other factors.
Our impairment tests in 2018, 2017 and 2016 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses significa ntly exceeded their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in
an impairment.
Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation
approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except
the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplac e participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated
wireless licen ses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were required to make significant estimates about future cash flows specifically associated with our wireless
licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows and assumed terminal value and growth rates. We considered current and
expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless network technology and infrastructure and related
equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash flows. The disco unt rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of
capital (WACC), or expected return, that a marketpla ce participant would have required as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our consideration
of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date. Accordingly , our discount rate incorporated our estimate of the expected return a
marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date, including the risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the
valuation date. The terminal value growth rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’ s long-term growth rate.
Goodwill
At December 31, 2018, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $24.6 billion , of which $18.4 billion  was in our Wireless reporting unit, $3.9 billion  was in our
Wireline reporting unit, $0.2 billion  was in our Media reporting unit and $2.1 billion  was in our Connect report ing unit. To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we
have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we
elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires the
determination of the fair value of each respective reporting unit.
We performed  a quantitative impairment assessment for all of our reporting units in 2018 and for all of our reporting units, except for our Wireless reporting unit, in 2017
and 2016 for which a qualitative assessment was completed.  For 2018, 2017 and 2016, our impairment tests indic ated that the fair value for each of our Wireless, Wireline
and Connect reporting units exceeded their respectiv e carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. For details on our Media reporting unit, refer to the
discussion below .
Under our quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market approach
includes the use of comparative multiples to corrobo rate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-
projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the
discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present
value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the WACC, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the
valuation date. The application of our goodwill impa irment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factored in
assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA growth relative
to history and market trends and expectations. The market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in the selection comparable public company
multiples and benchmarks.  The selection of companies was influenced by differences in growth and profi tability , and volatility in market prices of peer companies. Similar
assumptions were made by management for all of our reporting units. These valuation inputs are inherently uncertain, and an adverse change in one or a combination of
these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future.
The fair value of our Wireless and Connect reportin g units significantly exceeded their respective carrying value for the impairment tests performed for 2018, 2017 and
2016.
Our Wireline reporting unit has experienced increasi ng market pressures that have resulted in lower than expected revenues and earnings and these pressures may persist
over the near term. A projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have  a significant negative impact on its fair value and may result in
impairment charges in the future. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) further anticipated decreases in service pricing, sales volumes and long-term
growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes
to macroeconomic factors, such as increases to long-term interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit.
At the goodwill impairment measurement date of October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Wireline reporting  unit had fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by 5%, 14%
and 20%, respectively . See Note 4 to the consolidated  financial statements for additional information. As a result of our goodwill assessment, management believes there is
an increasing risk that our W ireline reporting unit may be required to recognize an impairment char ge in the future.
Our Media business, which  operated under the "Oath" brand during 2018 and is now referred to as Verizon Media, experienced increased competitive and market pressures
throughout 2018 that resulted in lower than expected revenues and earnings. These pressures are expected to continue and have resulted in a loss of market positioning to our
competitors in the digital advertising business. Oath also achieved lower than expected benefits from the integration of the Y ahoo Inc. and AOL Inc. (AOL) businesses.
As of August 2018, Hans Vestber g became Chief Executive Officer of Verizon, and as of October 2018, K. Guru Gowrappan was appointed Chief Executive Officer of our
Media business. In connection with Verizon’ s annual budget process in the fourth quarter of 2018, the new leadership at both Oath and Verizon completed a comprehensive
five-year strategic planning  review of Oath’ s business prospects resulting in unfavorable adjustments to Oath’ s financial projections. These revised projections were used as
a key input into Oath's annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter .
Consistent with our accounting policy , we applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs,
including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted determination  that the fair value of the Media reporting unit was less than its
carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $4.6 billion  ($4.5 billion  after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2018 in our
consolidated statement of income. The goodwill balance
of the Media reporting unit was approximately $4.8 billion prior to the incurre nce of this impairment charge. For 2017 and 2016, our impairment test indicated that the fair
value of our Media reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
Pension and Other Postr etirement Benefit Plans
•We maintain benefit plans  for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2018 , in the
aggregate, pension plan benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets, which will result in future pension plan expense. Other postretirement benefit
plans have larger benefit obligations than plan assets,  resulting in expense. Significant benefit plan assump tions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate of return
on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updat ed and impact the amount of benefit plan income, expense, assets
and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. A sensitivity analysis
of the impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefit obligations and expense (income) recorded, as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in
the actual versus expected  return on plan assets as of December 31, 2018  and for the year then ended pertaining to Verizon’ s pension and postretirement benefit plans, is
provided in the table below .

 -1.00 9
Health care trend rates +1.00 462
 -1.00 (485)
* In determin ing its pension and other postretireme nt obligation, the Company used a weighted-average discount rate of 4.4% . The rate was selected to approximate the
composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2018 . The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with
the time periods during which benefits payments are expected to occur , were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $0.3 billion
par outstanding).
The annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted the full yield curve approach to
estimate the interest cost component of net periodic  benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. We accounted for this change as a change in accounting
estimate and, accordingly , accounted for it prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Prior to this change, we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a
single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.
The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from  a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred
high-quality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit
payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.
Income T axes
•Our current and deferred income taxes and associate d valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in
connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items. As a global
commercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of
deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benef its taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance
with the accounting standa rd relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-s tep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances and
information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact
income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax
payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unan ticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances. See
Note 12  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Property , Plant and Equipment
•Our Property , plant and equipment  balance represents a signi ficant component of our consolidated assets. We record Property , plant and equipment  at cost. We depreciate
Property , plant and equipment  on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We expect that a one-year increase in estimated useful lives of our Property ,
plant and equipment  would result in a decrease to our 2018  depreciation expense of $2.9 billion  and that a one-year decrease would result in an increase of approximately
$4.9 billion  in our 2018  depreciation expense.
Accounts Receivable
•We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses resulting from
the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment loans are considered financial instruments and are initially recorded at
fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses are recorded as incurred. However , loan balances are assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance is recorded if
the loan is considered impaired. Our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on management’ s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts
and includes consideration  of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is
reasonably believed to be collectible. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the
general economic environment and the aging of such receivables. Similar to traditional service revenue, we record direct device payment plan agreement bad debt expense
based on an estimate of the percentage of equipme nt revenue that will not be collected. This estimate is based on a number of factors including historical write-of f
experience, credit quality of the customer base and other factors such as macroeconomic conditions.  If there is a deterioration of our customers’ financia l condition or if
future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect
earnings in the period the adjustments are made.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
See Note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standard updates not yet adopted as of December 31, 2018 .
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Wireless
Spectrum License T ransactions
From time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance
the reliability of our network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. See Note 3  to the consol idated financial statements for additiona l information regarding
our spectrum license transactions.
Straight Path
In May 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Straight Path , a holder of millimeter wave spectrum configured for 5G wireless services, for total consideration
reflecting an enterprise value of approximately  $3.1 billion . Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we agreed to pay: (1) Straight Path shareholders  $184.00  per share,
payable in Verizon shares; and (2) certain transaction  costs payable in cash of approximately  $0.7 billion , consisting primarily of a fee to be paid to the FCC.  The transaction
closed in February 2018 at which time we issued approximately  49 million shares of Verizon common stock, valued at approximately  $2.4 billion , and paid the associated cash
consideration. See Note 3  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Wireline
Access Line Sale
In February 2015, we enter ed into a definitive agreement with Frontier  pursuant to which Verizon sold its local exchange business and related landline activities in California,
Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these
three states, for approxima tely $10.5 billion  (approximately $7.3 billion  net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion  of
indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier . The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange carriers in
California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The transaction closed on April 1, 2016.  See Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.
XO Holdings
In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire  XO, which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based  IP and Ethernet networks in the U.S.
Concurrently , we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings,  NextLink , that held its wireless
spectrum. The agreement included an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy NextLink. In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of XO for total cash consideration
of approximately  $1.5 billion , of which  $0.1 billion  was paid in 2015, and we prepaid  $0.3 billion  in connection with the NextLink option which repres ented the fair value of
the option.
In April 2017, we exercise d our option to buy NextL ink for approximately  $0.5 billion , subject to certain adjustme nts, of which  $0.3 billion  was prepaid in the first quarter of
2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired
spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion  of wireless licenses, $0.1 billion  of a deferred tax liability and $0.1 billion  of other liabilities. The spectrum
acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment . See Note 3  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Data Center Sale
In December  2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in Marc h 2017, with Equinix  Inc. pursuant to which we agreed to sell 23
customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately  $3.6 billion , subject to certain adjustments . The transaction closed in May 2017.
WideOpenW est, Inc.
In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from  WOW! , a leading provider of
communications services. The transaction closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! will complete the
build-out of the network assets in 2019. The total cash consideration for the transactions is approximately  $0.3 billion , of which  $0.2 billion  was received in December 2017.
Other
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
In May 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AOL Inc. pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of AOL at a price of  $50.00  per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary  of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the
closing of these transaction s was approximately  $3.8 billion . Holders of approximately  6.6 million  shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law. In September 2018,
we obtained court approval to settle this matter for total cash consideration of  $0.2 billion , of which an insignificant amount relates to interest, resulting in an insignificant gain.
We paid the cash consideration in October 2018.
Acquisition of Y ahoo! Inc.’ s Operating Business
In July 2016, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo . Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms  and subject to the
conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’ s operating business for approximately  $4.83 billion  in cash,
subject to certain adjustments (the T ransaction).
In February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Transaction purchase price was reduced by $350 million  to
approximately  $4.48 billion  in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties also agreed that certain user security and data breaches incurred by
Yahoo (and the losses arising therefrom) were to be disregarded: (1) for purposes of specified condit ions to Verizon’ s obligations to close the Transaction; and (2) in
determining whether a "Business Material Adverse Ef fect" under the Purchase Agreement had occurred.
In June 2017, we complete d the Transaction. The aggregate purchase consideration at the closing of the Transaction was approximately  $4.7 billion , including cash acquired of
$0.2 billion .
Concurrently with the amendment of the Purchase Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo that Verizon agreed to purchase pursuant
to the Transaction, also entered into an amendment to the related reorganization agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo (which has changed its name to Altaba Inc. following the
closing of the Transaction) retains  50% of certa in post-closing liabilities arising out of governmental or third-party investigations, litigations or other claims related to certain
user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo prior to its acquisition by Verizon, including an August 2013 data breach disclosed by Yahoo on December 14, 2016. At that
time, Yahoo disclosed that more than one billion of the approximately three billion accounts existing in 2013 had likely been affected. In accordance with the original
Transaction agreements, Yahoo will continue to retain  100%  of any liabili ties arising out of any shareholder lawsuits (including derivative claims) and investigation s and
actions by the SEC.
Prior to the closing of the Transaction, pursuant to a related reorganization agreement, Yahoo transferred all of the assets and liabilities constituting Yahoo’ s operating business
to the subsidiaries that we acquired in the Transactio n. The assets that we acquired did not include Yahoo’s ownership interests in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan and certain other
investments, certain undeveloped land recently divested by Yahoo, certain non-core intellectual proper ty or its cash, other than the cash from its operating business we
acquired. We received for our benefit and that of our current and certain future affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to all of Yahoo’ s
intellectual property that was not conveyed with the business.
In October 2017, based upon information that we received in connection with our integration of Yahoo's operating business, we disclosed that we believe that the August 2013
data breach previously disclosed by Y ahoo af fected all of its accounts.
Fleetmatics Gr oup PLC

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Dir ectors and Shar eholders of V erizon Communications Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in
Internal Cont rol-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our
opinion, V erizon maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have  audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of
Verizon as of December 31, 2018  and 2017 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2018 , and the related notes and our report dated February 15, 2019  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
Verizon’ s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon's
internal control over finan cial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtainin g an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting  is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accord ance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the mainten ance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit prepar ation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provi de reasonabl e assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisit ion, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a
material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

suggest evide nce of control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as variable
interest entitie s (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary . For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in
Net income and Total equity . Investments in businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are
accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are included in Investments in unconso lidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Basis of Presentation
We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
Use of Estimates
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could dif fer from those estimates.
Examples of significant estimates include the allowa nce for doubtful accounts, the recoverability of property , plant and equipment, the recoverability of intangible assets and
other long-lived assets, fair value measurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwil l, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits,
valuation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
in connection with business combinations.
Revenue Recognition
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. We
account for these revenues under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (T opic 606) , which we adopted on January 1, 2018 ,
using the modified retrospective approach. This standard update, along with related subsequently issued updates, clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a
common revenue standard U.S. GAAP . The standard update also amends current guidance for the recognition of costs to obtain and fulfill contracts with customers such that
incremental costs of obtaining and direct costs of fulfilling contracts with customers will be deferred and amortized consistent with the transfer of the related good or service.
We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements
primarily related to wirele ss device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized
agent.
Wireless
Our Wireless segment earns revenue primarily by providing access to and usage of our telecommunications network and selling equipment. Performance obligations in a
typical contract, as determined in accordance with Topic 606 , with a customer include service and equipment.
Service
We offer our wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the
service allow ance units are used or as time elapses,  because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy  our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the
customer . Monthly service is generally billed in adva nce, which results in a contract liability . See Note 2  for additional information. For postpaid plans where monthly usage
exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises
the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).
Wireless Equipment
We sell wirele ss devices and accessories. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer , as this is when control
passes to the customer . In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device,
in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans.
Under a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discou nted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract
(typically for a term of 24 months  or less).
Under a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer , typically over a
24-month  term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-mon th contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a
specified term, contingent upon the customer maintai ning service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on
their relative selling price, and are recognized when earned.
A financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term,
differs from the satisfactio n of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon trans fer of device to the customer . We periodically assess, at the contract
level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations related to
our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the
marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined
that the financ ing compone nt in our existing Wireless direct channel device payments and fixed-term contracts with customers is not significant and therefore is not accounted
for separately . See Note 8  for additiona l information  on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized
agent in our indirect channel.
Wireless Contracts
Total contract  revenue, which represents the transacti on price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their
estimated standalone sellin g prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessor y to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase
discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to custo mers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time
without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess
whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to
early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights
and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures.
From time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified
portion of their device payment plan agreement amou nt and trading in their device in good working order . We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full
amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The guarantee
obligation was insignificant  at December 31, 2018  and 2017 . The total transaction price is reduced by the guarantee obligation, which is accounted for outside the scope of
Topic 606, and the remaining transaction price is allocated between the performance obligations within the contract.
Our fixed-term  plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at subsidized prices. This results in the creation of a contract asset at the time of sale, which represents the
recognition of equipment revenue in excess of amounts billed.
For our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting
in a contract liability .
We may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the
transaction price, and accordingly we recognize revenue based on the estimated amount to which we expect to be entitled after considering expected returns. Returns and
credits are estimated at contract inception and upda ted at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We also may provide credits or
incentives on our products and services for contracts with resellers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.
These amounts have not been significant.
For certain bundled offerings/transactions involving  third-party service providers, we evaluate gross versus net considerations by assessing indicators of control. These
offerings have not been significant.
Wireline
Our Wireline segment earns revenue primarily by providing our customers with services involving access to our telecommunications network and facilities. These services
include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our consumer and business customers and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their
customers, as well as profe ssional and integrated managed services for our large enterprises and governmen t customers. We offer these services to customers that we categorize
in the following customer groups: Consumer Markets, Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets.
Service
For Wireline service, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the
service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our
Wireline service revenues are the result of providing access to our network, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally
billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.
For communication and connectivity services provid ed to our residential customers, which are sold to these customers on a standalone basis or as part of a bundle, we
recognize service revenue over time since control over these services passes to the customer as the service is rendered. Service revenue is recognized ratably each month.
Wireline Contracts
Total consideration, for services that are bundled in a single contract, is allocated to each performance obligation based on our standalone selling price for each service. While
many contracts include one or more service performance obligations, the revenue recognition pattern is generally not impacted by the allocation since the services are generally
satisfied over the same period of time. We estimate the standalone selling price to be the price of the services when sold on a standalone basis without any promotional
discount. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers such as penalties
that a customer would have to pay to early terminate  a fixed-term contract. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts
our determination of transaction price and related disclosures.
We may provide performa nce-based credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with our Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and some Business
Markets custo mers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the transaction price. Credits are estimated at contract inception and are updated at the
end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.
For certain bundled offerings/transactions involving  third-party service providers, we evaluate gross versus net considerations by assessing indicators of control. These
offerings have not been significant.
Other
Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising  revenue is generated by the display of graphical advertisements and
other performance-based advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated when a consumer clicks on a text-based advertisement on their screen. Our Media business,
Verizon Media, which operated in 2018 under the "Oath" brand, primarily earns revenue through display advertising on Verizon Media properties, as well as on third-party
properties through our advertising platforms, search advertising and subscription arrangements. We recognize revenue at a point in time for our display and search advertising
contracts and over time for our subscription contrac ts. We determined that we are generally the principal in transactions carried out through our advertising platforms, and
therefore report gross revenue based on the amount billed to our customers. Where we are the principal, we concluded that while the control and transfer of digital advertising
inventory occurs in a rapid, real-time environment, our proprietary technology enables us to identify , enhance, verify and solely control digital advertising inventory that we
then sell to our customers. Our control is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers for fulfillment and the fact that we can exercise a level of
discretion over pricing.
Verizon Connect primarily earns revenue through subscription services. W e recognize revenue over time for our subscription contracts.
We report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions on a net basis.
Maintenance and Repairs
We char ge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services as these costs
are incurred.
Advertising Costs
Costs for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the periods in
which they are incurred. See Note 15  for additional information.
Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per common share
include the dilutive ef fect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans.
There were a total of approximately 4 million , 5 million  and 6 million  outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the computation
of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively .
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates quoted market value and includes amounts held in money market funds.
Cash collecti ons on the device payment plan agree ment receivables collateralizing asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into
segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in the following line items on the consolidated balance sheets:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2018  2017  Increase
Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,745  $ 2,079  $ 666
Restricted cash:      
Prepaid expenses and other 1,047  693  354
Other assets 124  116 8
Cash, cash equivalents and r estricted cash $ 3,916  $ 2,888  $ 1,028
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
Investments in equity securities that are not accounted  for under equity method accounting or result in consolidation are to be measured at fair value. For investments in equity
securities without readily determinable fair values, Verizon elects the measurement alternative permi tted under GAAP to measure these investments at cost, less any
impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer . For investments in
debt securities without quoted prices, Verizon uses an alternative matrix pricing method. Investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation of the investee are
included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt securities are included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at cost net of an allowance for credit losses, with the exception of indirect-channel device payment
plan loans. We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses
resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment loans are considered financial instruments and are initially
recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses are recorded as incurred. However , loan balances are assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance is
recorded if the loan is considered impaired. Our allow ance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on management’ s assessment of the collectability of specific customer
accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is
reasonably believed to be collectible. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general
economic environment and the aging of such receivables. Similar to traditional service revenue, we record direct device payment plan agreement bad debt expense based on an
estimate of the percentage of equipment revenue that will not be collected. This estimate is based on a number of factors including historical write-of f experience, credit quality
of the custom er base and other factors such as macroeconomic conditions.  We monitor the aging of our accounts with device payment plan agreement receivables and write-of f
account balances if collection ef forts are unsuccessful and future collection is unlikely .
Inventories
Inventory consists of wirel ess and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost (determined principally on either an average cost or first-in, first-out
basis) or net realizable value.
Plant and Depreciation
Property , Plant and Equipment
We record property , plant and equipment at cost. Property , plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the time the asset
was placed in service.
When depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the property , plant and equipment accounts and
any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in income.
We capitalize  and depreciate network software purch ased or developed along with related property , plant and equipment assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the
acquisition or construction  of network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-related
assets.
In connection  with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property , plant and equipment during 2018 , we determined that the average useful lives of certain assets
would be increased. These changes in estimates were applied prospectively and resulted in a decrease to depreciation expense of $0.3 billion  for the year ended 2018 . In
addition, during 2016 we determined that the average  useful lives of certain leasehold improvements would be increased from 5 to 7 years. This change resulte d in decreases to
depreciation expense of $0.1 billion , $0.1 billion  and $0.2 billion  in 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively . We determined that changes were also necessary to the remaining
estimated useful lives of certain assets as a result of technology changes, enhancements and planned retirem ents. These changes resulted in increases in depreciation expense of
$0.5 billion , $0.3 billion  and $0.3 billion  in 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively . While the timing and extent of current deployment plans are subject to ongoing analysis and
modification, we believe that the current estimates of useful lives are reasonable.
Computer Software Costs
We capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software that has a useful life in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to
internal-use network and non-network software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Planning,
software main tenance and training costs are expense d in the period in which they are incurred. Also, we capitalize interest associated with the development of internal-use
network and non-network software. Capitalized non-network internal-use software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 3 to 7 years and are
included in Other intangib le assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. For a discussion of our impair ment policy for capitalized software costs, see "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" below . Also, see Note 4  for additional information of internal-use non-network software reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of busin esses over the fair value of the identifiable net asset s acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually in
the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present.
To determine  if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and
perform an impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist. The quantitative impa irment test for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level and
compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method) to its carrying value. Estimated fair
values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy , see Fair V alue Measurements discussion below for additional information.
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider severa l qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the
excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations
(including industry revenue and Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)  margin projections), the recent and projected financial performance
of the reporting unit, as well as other factors.
The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based
on the present value of two components, a projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting
unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from
the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate  of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a
marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value
over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of 2018 , the Company updated its five-year strategic planning review for
each of its reporting units. Those plans considered current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, the Company’ s view of growth-rates and-
anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.
See Note 4  for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing.
Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization
A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to
provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover , we have determined that there are currently no legal,
regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived
intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determ ination for wireless licenses each year to determine  whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite
useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless
network.
We test our wireless licen ses for potential impairme nt annually or more frequently if impairment indic ators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and
proceed directly to perform ing the quantitative impair ment test. Our quantitative assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to
the aggregate d carrying amount as of the test date. Using a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach.
The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up
company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant
would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the
aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses,  then an impairment charge is recognized. As part of our qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors
including the business enterprise value of our Wireless segment, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market
considerations (including industry revenue and EBITD A), margin projections, the recent and projected financial performance of our Wireless segment, as well as other factors.
See Note 4  for additional information regarding our impairment tests.
Interest expen se incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization
period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets
Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal- use software) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All of
our intangible assets subjec t to amortization, and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recov erability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the
net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generate d from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the
next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any . We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to
determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.
For informati on related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other
acquired intangible assets, see Note 4 .
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the
methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3—No observable pricing inputs in the market
Financial assets and financ ial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their
categorization within the fair value hierarchy .
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we
operate.
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are
recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce
our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is
more likely than not that a tax position will be sustain ed upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of
the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate
taxing authori ty that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is
measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50
percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will
generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax
asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability .
Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our ef fective tax rate.
Verizon has completed its analysis of the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) , including analyzing the effects of any Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  and U.S.
Treasury guidance issued, and state tax law changes enacted, within the maximum one year measurement period resulting in no significant adjustments to the $16.8 billion
provisional amount previously recorded.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure and recognize  compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See Note 10  for
additional information.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency . For these foreign entities, we translate income statement amounts at average exchange rates
for the period, and we translate assets and liabilities at end-of-period exchange rates. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive income, a
separate component of Equity , in our consolidated balance sheets. We report exchange gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency transactions of a long-term nature in
Accumulated other comprehensive income. Other exchange gains and losses are reported in income.
Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year, as well as interest on projected benefit obligations, are accrued currently . Prior
service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive
benefits. Expected return on plan assets is determin ed by applying the return on assets assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognized in operating results in the year in which they occur . These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon
management employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the company retiree medical subsidy . See Note 1 1 for additional information.
We recognize a pension or a postretirement plan’ s funded status as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we measure any unrecognized prior
service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income tax.
Derivative Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We employ risk management
strategies, which may inclu de the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and
foreign exchange forwards. W e do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. See Note 9  for additional information.
We measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities on our consolida ted balance sheets. Our derivative instruments are valued primarily
using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of
derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized in earnings in the current period . For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments is recognized in earnings, along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments, along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item, are reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. For net investment hedges of certain of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is reported in Other
comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially of fset the impact of foreign currency changes on the value of our net investment.
Variable Interest Entities
VIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additio nal subordinated financial support from other parties, have equity
investors that do not have the ability to make signifi cant decisions relating to the entity’ s operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected
losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual  returns of the entity . We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary .
The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to
absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
The following ASUs were issued by Financial Accounting Standards Board (F ASB), and have been recently adopted by V erizon.
 DescriptionDate of
AdoptionEffect on Financial Statements
 ASU 2014-09, Revenue fr om Contracts with Customers (T opic 606)
 This standard update, along with related subsequently issued updates, clarifies the
principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for
U.S. GAAP . The standard update amends current guidance for the recognition of
costs to obtain and fulfill contracts with customers such that incremental costs of
obtaining and direct costs of fulfilling contracts with customers will be deferred and
amortized consistent with the transfer of the related good or service. The standard
update intends to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues;
improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries,
jurisdictions, and capital markets; and provide more useful information to users of
financial statements through improved disclosure requirements.1/1/2018 We recorded the pre-tax cumulative ef fect of $3.9 billion ($2.9 billion
net of tax) as an adjustment to the January 1, 2018 opening balance of
Retained earnings. W e adopted this standard using the modified
retrospective method. The cumulative after -tax ef fect of the changes
made to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of this standard
are reflected in the table below .
  
See Note 2 for additional information related to revenues and contract
costs, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures required under
Topic 606, as well as a reconciliation of the adjustments from the
adoption of T opic 606 relative to T opic 605 on certain impacted
financial statement line items. 
 
 ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10)
 The amendments in this update make tar geted improvements to GAAP by requiring
most equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in net income. For investments in equity securities without readily
determinable fair values, the cost method is eliminated. A practicability exception is
available for investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable
fair values. These investments may be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus
or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions
for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer .
This update simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without
readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify
impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates impairment exists, an entity is
required to measure the investment at fair value1/1/2018 We adopted this standard update on a prospective basis resulting in an
insignificant adjustment to our opening retained earnings. The
amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable
fair values are applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as
of the date of adoption.
 
 
 ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (T opic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments
 This standard update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of
reducing the existing diversity in practice for these issues. This standard update
requires, among other things, that cash receipts from payments on a transferor ’s
beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables be classified as cash inflows
from investing activities.
The amendment relating to beneficial interests in securitization transactions
impacted our presentation of collections of certain deferred purchase price from
sales of wireless device payment plan agreement receivables in our consolidated
statements of cash flows.1/1/2018 We retrospectively reclassified approximately $0.6 billion of deferred
purchase price collections from Cash flows from operating activities to
Cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statement of
cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $1.1 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no other significant
impacts as a result of adopting this standard.

 ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (T opic 230): Restricted Cash
 The amendments in this update require that cash and cash equivalent balances in a
statement of cash flows include those amounts deemed to be restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents.1/1/2018  We have provided a reconciliation from Cash and cash equivalents as
presented in our consolidated balance sheets to Cash, cash equivalents
and restricted cash as reported in our consolidated statements of cash
flows. W e adopted the amendments in this accounting standard update
on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this standard update for the
year ended December 31, 2017 resulted in an increase in cash flow used
in financing activities of $0.6 billion, a decrease in cash flow provided
by operating activities of $0.1 billion and an insignificant increase in
cash flow used in investing activities. There was an insignificant impact
to our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2016.
See "Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash" for additional
information, as well as a discussion of the nature of our restricted cash
balances. 
 ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retir ement Benefits (T opic 715)
 The amendments in this update require an employer to report the service cost
component arising from employer sponsored pension and other postretirement plans
in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services
rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net
benefit cost, including the recognition of prior service credits, will be presented in
the consolidated statements of income separately from the service cost component
and outside the subtotal of income from operations. The amendments in this update
also allow only the service cost component of pension and other postretirement
benefit costs to be eligible for capitalization when applicable. V erizon previously
recorded service cost and other components of net periodic benefit cost in operating
expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The amendments in this update
allow a practical expedient that permits an employer to use the amounts disclosed in
its employee benefits footnote for the prior comparative periods as the estimation
basis for applying the retrospective presentation. 1/1/2018 As required by the amendments in this update, the presentation of the
service cost component and other components of net periodic benefit
cost in the consolidated statements of income were applied
retrospectively , and the updates for the capitalization of the service cost
component of net periodic benefit cost in assets were applied
prospectively on and after the ef fective date. V erizon reclassified the
other components of net periodic benefit costs from Cost of services
and Selling, general and administrative expense to Other income
(expense), net, which is part of non-operating expenses. The
retrospective adoption of this standard update had an insignificant
impact to consolidated operating income for the year ended
December 31, 2017 and an increase to consolidated operating income of
approximately $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.
These impacts to consolidated operating income were fully of fset by an
insignificant decrease and a $2.2 billion decrease to Other income
(expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively . There was no impact to consolidated Net income for the
years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.
Verizon utilized the practical expedient to estimate the impact on the
prior comparative period information presented in the consolidated
statements of income. 
 ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Compr ehensive Income (T opic 220)
 The amendments in this update allow a reclassification from accumulated other
comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax ef fects resulting from
TCJA. The stranded tax ef fects result from the change in the federal tax rate for
deferred taxes recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income. This standard
update is ef fective as of the first quarter of 2019; however , early adoption is
permitted. V erizon has elected to early adopt this update ef fective January 1, 2018
and record the ef fects of adoption at the beginning of the period of adoption.1/1/2018 The adoption of this standard update resulted in a char ge to Retained
earnings of $0.7 billion which consists primarily of stranded tax ef fects
related to deferred taxes for pensions and postretirement benefits. It is
Verizon’ s policy to release income tax ef fects from accumulated other
comprehensive income at the same time that the related unit of account
affects net income. The cumulative after -tax ef fect of the changes made
to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of this standard are
reflected in the table below . 
The cumulative after -tax ef fect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of T opic 606, ASU 2018-02 and other ASUs was as follows:

AdoptionEffect on Financial Statements
 ASU 2016-02, Leases (T opic 842)
 In February 2016, the F ASB issued this standard update to increase transparency
and improve comparability by requiring entities to recognize assets and liabilities
on the balance sheet for all leases, with certain exceptions. In addition, through
improved disclosure requirements, the standard update will enable users of financial
statements to further understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows
arising from leases. This standard update allows for a modified retrospective
application and is ef fective as of the first quarter of 2019; however , early adoption
is permitted. Entities are allowed to apply the modified retrospective approach: (1)
retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements
with the cumulative-ef fect adjustment recognized at the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented; or (2) retrospectively at the beginning of the period
of adoption (January 1, 2019) through a cumulative-ef fect adjustment. The ef fective
date of this standard is January 1, 2019, at which time V erizon will adopt the
standard using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-ef fect
adjustment to opening retained earnings recorded at the beginning of the period of
adoption. Therefore, upon adoption, V erizon will recognize and measure leases
without revising comparative period information or disclosure. The modified
retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that
entities may elect to apply .1/1/2019 We have established a cross-functional coordinated team to implement
the standard update. W e have completed our assessment of the
transition practical expedients of fered by the standard. These practical
expedients lessen the transitional burden of implementing the standard
update by not requiring a reassessment of certain conclusions reached
under existing lease accounting guidance. Accordingly , we will apply
these practical expedients and will not reassess: (1) whether an expired
or existing contract is a lease or contains an embedded lease; (2) lease
classification of an expired or existing lease; (3) initial direct costs for
an existing lease; and (4) whether an existing or expired land easement
is or contains a lease if it has not historically been accounted for as a
lease. W e have identified and implemented a new system solution to
meet the requirements of the new standard and have identified and
implemented processes and internal controls to meet the standards
reporting and disclosure requirements. 
Upon adoption of this standard, there will be a significant impact in our
consolidated balance sheet as we expect to recognize a right-of-use
asset and liability related to substantially all operating lease
arrangements, which we currently estimate will range between $21.0
billion and $23.0 billion. V erizon’ s current operating lease portfolio
included in this range is primarily comprised of network equipment
including towers, distributed antenna systems, and small cells, real
estate, connectivity mediums including dark fiber , and equipment
leases. In addition, pre-tax deferred gains of approximately $0.6 billion
arising from prior period sales-leaseback transactions, which would
have been recognized to income over an average period of nine years,
will be adjusted through opening retained earnings on January 1, 2019.
Lastly , we expect a lower amount of lease costs to qualify as initial
direct costs under the new standard which will result in an immediate
recognition of expense instead of recognition of expense over time.

 ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Cr edit Losses (T opic 326)
 In June 2016, the F ASB issued this standard update which requires certain financial
assets be measured at amortized cost net of an allowance for estimated credit losses
such that the net receivable represents the present value of expected cash collection.
In addition, this standard update requires that certain financial assets be measured at
amortized cost reflecting an allowance for estimated credit losses expected to occur
over the life of the assets. The estimate of credit losses must be based on all relevant
information including historical information, current conditions and reasonable and
supportable forecasts that af fect the collectability of the amounts. An entity will
apply the update through a cumulative ef fect adjustment to retained earnings as of
the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is ef fective. A
prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other -
than-temporary impairment has been recognized before the ef fective date. Early
adoption of this standard is permitted.1/1/2020 We are currently evaluating the impacts that this standard update will
have on our various financial assets which we expect to include, but is
not limited to, our device payment plan agreement receivables and
service receivables.  W e have established a cross-functional coordinated
team to address the potential impacts to our systems, processes and
internal controls in order to meet the standard update's accounting and
reporting requirements. 
 
Note 2. Revenue and Contract Costs
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. We
account for these revenues under Topic 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach. We also earn revenues that are not accounted for
under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance  arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the
interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent.
We applied the new revenue recognition standard to customer contracts not completed at the date of initial adoption. For incomplete contracts that were modified before the
date of adoption, the Company elected to use the practical expedient available under the modified retrospective method, which allows us to aggregate the effect of all
modifications when identifying satisfied and unsati sfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating transaction price to the satisfied and
unsatisfied performance obligations for the modified contract at transition. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while
amounts reported for prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under accounting standards in ef fect for those periods.
In our Wireless business, prior to the adoption of Topic 606, we were required to limit the revenue recognized when a wireless device was sold to the amount of consideration
that was not contingent on the provision of future services, which was typically limited to the amount of consideration received from the customer at the time of sale. Under
Topic 606, the total consideration in the contract is allocated between wireless equipment and service based on their relative standalone selling prices. This change primarily
impacts our arrangements that include sales of wireless devices at subsidized prices in conjunction with a fixed-term plan, also known as the subsidy model, for service.
Accordingly , under Topic 606, generally more equipment revenue is recognized upon sale of the equipm ent to the customer and less service revenue is recognized over the
contract term than was previously recognized under the prior "Revenue Recognition" (Topic 605) standa rd. At the time the equipment is sold, this allocation results in the
recognition of a contract asset equal to the difference between the amount of revenue recognized and the amount of consideration received from the customer . As of January
2017, we no longer offer consumers new fixed-term plans with subsidized equipment pricing; however , we continue to offer fixed-term plans to our business customers. At
December 31, 2018  and December 31, 2017 , approximately 14% and 19% of retail postpaid connections were under fixed-term plans, respectively .
Topic 606 also requires the deferral of incremental costs incurred to obtain a customer contract, which are then amortized to expense, as a component of Selling, general and
administrative expense, over the respective periods of expected benefit. As a result, a significant amount of our sales commission costs, which were historically expensed as
incurred by our W ireless and W ireline businesses under our previous accounting, are now deferred and amortized under T opic 606.
Finally , under  Topic 605, at the time of the sale of a device, we imputed risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement receivables. We recorded the imputed
interest as a reduction to the related accounts receivable and interest income was recognized over the finan ced device payment term. Under Topic 606, while there continues to
be a financing  component in both the fixed-term plans and device payment plans, also known as the instal lment model, we have determined that this financing component for
our customer classes in the Wireless direct channel plans is not significant and therefore we no longer impute interest for these contracts. This change results in additional
revenue recognized upon the sale of wireless devices and no interest income recognized over the device payment term.
A reconciliation of the adjustments from the adoption of Topic 606 relative to Topic 605 on certain impacted financial statement line items in our consolidated statements of
income and balance sheet were as follows:

Revenue by Category
We operate and manage our business in two reportable segments, W ireless and W ireline. Revenue is disaggregated by products and services, and customer groups, respectively ,
which we view as the relevant categorization of revenues for these businesses. See Note 13  for additional information on revenue by segment.
Corporate and other includes the results of our Media business, Verizon Media, which operated in 2018 under the "Oath" brand, and our telematics business, branded Verizon
Connect. Oath generated revenues from contracts with customers under Topic 606 of approximately $7.7 billion  for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Verizon Connect
generated revenues from contracts with customers under T opic 606 of approximately $1.0 billion  for the year ended December 31, 2018 .
We also earn revenues, that are not accounted for under Topic 606, from leasing arrangements (such as towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily
related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent. Revenues
from arrangements that were not accounted for under T opic 606 were approximately $4.5 billion  for the year ended December 31, 2018 .
Remaining Performance Obligations
When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price may relate to service performance obligations
which were not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period. Below we disclose information relating to these unsatisfied performance obligations. We
have elected to apply the practical expedient available under Topic 606, that provides the option to exclude the expected revenues arising from unsatisfied performance
obligations related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. This situati on primarily arises with respect to certain month-to-month service
contracts. At December 31, 2018 , month-to-month service contracts represented approximately 86% of Wireless postpaid contracts and approximately 56% of Wireline
consumer and small business contracts.
Additionally , certain Wireless and Wireline contracts provide customers the option to purchase additional services. The fee related to the additional services is recognized when
the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).
Wireless customer contract s are generally either month-to-month and cancellable at any time (typically under a device payment plan) or contain terms greater than one month
(typically under a fixed-term plan). Additionally , customers may incur charges based on usage or may purchase additional optional services in conjunction with entering into a
contract which can be cancelled at any time and there fore are not included in the transaction price. When a service contract is longer than one month, the service contract term
will generally  be two years or less. The transaction price allocated to service performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the
reporting period, are generally related to our fixed-term plans.
Our wireless customers also include other telecommunications companies who utilize Verizon's network to resell wireless service to their respective end customers. Reseller
arrangements occur on a month-to-month basis or include a stated contract term, which generally extends longer than two years. Arrangements with a stated contract term
generally include an annual minimum revenue commitment over the term of the contract for which revenues will be recognized in future periods.
At December 31, 2018 , the transaction price related to Wireless unsatisfied performance obligations expected to be recognized for 2019 , 2020  and thereafter was $10.9 billion ,
$5.5 billion  and $2.2 billion , respectively .
Wireline customer contracts are either month-to-month, include a specified term with fixed monthly fees, or contain revenue commitments, and may also contain usage based
services. Consumer Markets customers under contract generally have a service term of two years; however , this term may be shorter at month-to-month. Certain Enterprise
Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets service contracts with customers extend into future periods, contain fixed monthly fees and usage-based fees, and can
include annual commitments per each year of the contract or commitments over the entire specified contract term. A significant number of contracts within these businesses
have a contract term that is twelve months or less.
At December 31, 2018 , the transaction price relating to Wireline unsatisfied performance obligations expected to be recognized for 2019 , 2020  and thereafter was $7.7 billion ,
$3.2 billion  and $0.9 billion , respectively .
In certa in Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets service contracts within Wireline and certain telematics service contracts within Corporate and other ,
there are customer contrac ts that have a contractual minimum fee over the total contract term. We cannot predict the time period when revenue will be recognized related to
those contrac ts; thus they are excluded from the time bands above. These contracts have varying terms spanning over five years ending in June 2023  and have aggregate
contract minimum payments totaling $3.9 billion .
Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our customers. Receivables presented in our consolidated balance sheet represent an unconditional
right to consideration. Contract balances represent amounts from an arrangement when either Verizon has performed, by transferring goods or services to the customer in
advance of receiving all or partial consideration for such goods and services from the customer , or the customer has made payment to Verizon in advance of obtaining control
of the goods and/or services promised to the customer in the contract.
Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for goods or services provided to the customers but for which we do not have an unconditional right at the
reporting date. Under a fixed-term plan, the total contract revenue is allocated between wireless services and equipment revenues, as discussed above. In conjunction with these
arrangements, a contract asset is created, which represents the difference between the amount of equipm ent revenue recognized upon sale and the amount of consideration
received from the customer . The contract asset is reclassified as accounts receivable as wireless services are provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as
service is provided over time, which results in our right to the payment being unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as
Prepaid expen ses and other and Other assets. We assess our contract assets for impairment on a quarterly basis and will recognize an impairment charge to the extent their
carrying amount is not recoverable. The impairment charge related to contract assets was $0.1 billion  for the year ended December 31, 2018 , and is includ ed in Other in the
table below .
Contract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive consideration in advance of providing the goods or services promised in the contract. We typically bill service
one month in advance, which is the primary component of the contract liability balance. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when services are provided to the
customer . The contract liability balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities.
The following table presents information about receivables from contracts with customers:

Total $ 4,943
Contract Costs
Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, which are then amortized to expense, over the respective periods of expected
benefit. We recognize an asset for incremental commission expenses paid to internal sales personnel and agents in conjunction with obtaining customer contracts. We only
defer these costs when we have determined the commissions are, in fact, incremental
and would not have been incurred absent the customer contract. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as commission expense over the period
representing the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Wireless costs to obtain contracts are amortized over our customers' estimated device upgrade cycles, as
such costs are typically incurred each time a customer upgrades.  Wireline costs to obtain contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer relationship period for
our Consumer Markets customers. Incremental costs to obtain contracts for our Enterprise Solutions, Partn er Solutions and Business Markets are insignificant. These costs are
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense.
We also defer costs incurr ed to fulfill contracts that: (1) relate directly to the contract; (2) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy our performance
obligation under the contract; and (3) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Contract fulfillment costs are expensed to Cost of services as
we satisfy our performance obligations. These costs principally relate to direct costs that enhance our W ireline business resources, such as costs incurred to install circuits.
We determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract at a portfolio level due to the similarities within these customer contract
portfolios.
Other costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as incurred.
Collectively , costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as Deferred contract costs, which were as follows:
  At December  31,
(dollars in millions) Amortization Period 2018
Wireless 2 to 3 years $ 2,989
Wireline 2 to 5 years 850
Corporate 2 to 3 years 56
Total  $ 3,895
Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets, respectively . The balances of Deferred contract costs
included in our consolidated balance sheet were as follows:
At December  31,
(dollars in millions) 2018
Assets  
Prepaid expenses and other $ 2,083
Other assets 1,812
Total $ 3,895
For the year ended December 31, 2018 , we recognized expense of $2.0 billion , associated with the amor tization of Deferred contra ct costs, primarily within Selling, general
and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
We assess our Deferred contract costs for impairment  on a quarterly basis. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the
remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those
goods and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been no impairment char ges recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 .
Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Wireless
Spectrum License T ransactions
Since 2016 , we have entered into or completed several strategic spectrum transactions including:
• During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain Advanced Wireless Services
(AWS) and Personal Comm unication Services (PCS) spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in March 2016. As a result, we received $0.4 billion
of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.1 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
• During the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of Sprint Corporation (Sprint) to exchange certain AWS and PCS
spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in September 2016. As a result, we received $0.3 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value
and recorded an insignificant gain in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
• During the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T  to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. This
non-cash exchange was completed in February 2017. As a result, we received $1.0 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum  licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain
of $0.1 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
• During the first quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of Sprint to exchange certain PCS spectrum licenses. This non-cash
exchange was completed in May 2017. As a result, we received $0.1 billion  of PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded an insignificant gain in Selling,
general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
• During the third quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of T-Mob ile USA Inc. to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum
licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in December 2017. As a result, we received $0.4 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and
recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.1 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
• During 2018, we entered into and completed various  wireless license transactions, including the purchase of Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path)  and
NextLink W ireless LLC ( NextLink ).
Straight Path
In May 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Straight Path , a holde r of millimeter wave spectrum configured for fifth-generation (5G) wireless services, for
total consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approximately  $3.1 billion . Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we agreed to pay: (1) Straight Path shareholders
$184.00  per share, payable in V erizon shares; and (2) certain transaction costs payable in cash of approximately  $0.7 billion , consisting primarily of a fee to be paid to the FCC.
The transaction closed in Febru ary 2018 at which time we issued approximately  49 million shares of Verizon common stock, valued at approximately  $2.4 billion , and paid the
associated cash consideration.
The acquisiti on of Straight Path was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded
approximately $4.5 billion  of wireless licenses and $1.4 billion  of a deferred tax liability . The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction is being used for our 5G techn ology
deployment. See Note 4  for additional information.
Wireline
Access Line Sale
In February 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier  Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon sold its local exchange business and
related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and
long distance voice accounts in these three states, for approximately  $10.5 billion  (approximately $7.3 billion  net of income taxes), subje ct to certain adjustments and including
the assumption of $0.6 billion  of indebtedne ss from Verizon by Frontier . The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s
incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs ) in California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The transaction closed on
April 1, 2016.
The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million  voice connections, 1.6 million  Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million  Fios video subscribers and the
related ILEC businesses from Verizon. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these businesses generated revenues of approximately $1.3 billion  and operating income of $0.7
billion  for Verizon. The operating  results of these businesses are excluded from our Wireline segment for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results
consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .
During April 2016, Verizon  used the net cash proceeds received of $9.9 billion  to reduce its consolidated indebtedness. See Note 7  for additional information. As a result of the
closing of the transaction, we derecognized property , plant and equipment of $9.0 billion , goodwill of $1.3 billion , $0.7 billion  of defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefit plan obligations and $0.6 billion  of indebtedness assumed by Frontier .
We recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2016. The pre-tax gain included a $0.5 billion  pension and postretirement benefit curtailment gain due to the elimination of the accrual of pension and other
postretirement benefits for some or all future services of a significant number of employees covered by three  of our defined benefit pension plans and one of our other
postretirement benefit plans.
XO Holdings
In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire  XO Holdings' wireline business (XO), which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based  Internet
Protocol and Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently , we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO
Holdings,  NextLink, that held its wireless spect rum. The agreement includ ed an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy NextLink. In February 2017, we completed our
acquisition of XO for total cash consideration of approximately  $1.5 billion , of which  $0.1 billion  was paid in 2015, and we prepaid  $0.3 billion  in connection with the
NextLink option which represented the fair value of the option.
In April 2017, we exercise d our option to buy NextL ink for approximately  $0.5 billion , subject to certain adjustme nts, of which  $0.3 billion  was prepaid in the first quarter of
2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired
spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion  of wireless licenses, $0.1 billion  of a deferred tax liability and $0.1 billion  of other liabilities. The spectrum
acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment .
The consolidated financial statements include the results of XO's operations from the date the acquisition closed. If the acquisition of XO had been completed as of January 1,
2016, the results of operations of V erizon would not have been significantly dif ferent than our previously reported results of operations.
The acquisition of XO was accounted for as a busines s combination. The consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as
of the close of the acquisit ion. We recorded approximately $1.2 billion  of property , plant and equipment, $0.1 billion  of goodwill and $0.2 billion  of other intangible assets.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
included within our W ireline segment, represents future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. See Note 4  for additional information.
Data Center Sale
In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2017, with Equinix , Inc. (Equinix)  pursuant to which we agreed to sell
23 customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately  $3.6 billion , subject to certain adjustments  (Data Center Sale) . The transaction closed in
May 2017.
For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, these sites generated an insignificant amount of revenues and earnings. As a result of the closing of the transaction, we
derecognized assets with a carrying value of $1.4 billion , primarily consisting of goodwill, property , plant and equipment and other intangible assets. The liabilitie s associated
with the sale were insignificant.
In connection with the Data Center Sale and other insignificant divestitures, we recorded a net gain on sale of divested businesses of approximately $1.8 billion  in Selling,
general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
WideOpenW est, Inc.
In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreem ent to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from  WideOpenW est, Inc. (WOW! ), a leading
provider of communicatio ns services. The transactio n closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! will
complete the build-out of the network assets in 2019 . The total cash consideration for the transactions is approximately  $0.3 billion , of which  $0.2 billion  was received in
December 2017.
Other
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
In May 2015, we entered into  an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AOL Inc. ( AOL ) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares
of common stock of AOL at a price of  $50.00  per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary  of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the
closing of these transaction s was approximately  $3.8 billion . Holders of approximately  6.6 million  shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law. In September 2018,
we obtained court approval  to settle this matter for total cash consideration of $0.2 billion  of which an insignificant amount relates to interest, resulting in an insignificant gain.
We paid the cash consideration in October 2018.
Acquisition of Y ahoo! Inc.’ s Operating Business
In July 2016, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’ s operating business for approximately  $4.83 billion
in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the T ransaction).
In February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Transaction purchase price was reduced by $350 million  to
approximately  $4.48 billion  in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties also agreed that certain user security and data breaches incurred by
Yahoo (and the losses arising therefrom) were to be disregarded: (1) for purposes of specified condit ions to Verizon’ s obligations to close the Transaction; and (2) in
determining whether a "Business Material Adverse Ef fect" under the Purchase Agreement had occurred.
Concurrently with the amendment of the Purchase Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo that Verizon agreed to purchase pursuant
to the Transaction, also entered into an amendment to the related reorganization agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo (which has changed its name to Altaba Inc. following the
closing of the Transaction) retains  50% of certa in post-closing liabilities arising out of governmental or third-party investigations, litigations or other claims related to certain
user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo prior to its acquisition by Verizon, including an August 2013 data breach disclosed by Yahoo on December 14, 2016. At that
time, Y ahoo disclosed that more than one billion of the approximately three billion accounts existing in 2013 had likely been af fected. In accordance with the original
Transaction agreements, Yahoo will continue to retain  100%  of any liabili ties arising out of any shareholder lawsuits (including derivative claims) and investigation s and
actions by the SEC.
In June 2017, we complete d the Transaction. The aggregate purchase consideration at the closing of the Transaction was approximately  $4.7 billion , including cash acquired of
$0.2 billion .
Prior to the closing of the Transaction, pursuant to a related reorganization agreement, Yahoo transferred all of the assets and liabilities constituting Yahoo’ s operating business
to the subsidiaries that we acquired in the Transactio n. The assets that we acquired did not include Yahoo’s ownership interests in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan and certain other
investments, certain undeveloped land recently divested by Yahoo, certain non-core intellectual proper ty or its cash, other than the cash from its operating business we
acquired. We received for our benefit and that of our current and certain future affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to all of Yahoo’ s
intellectual property that was not conveyed with the business.
In October 2017, based upon information that we received in connection with our integration of Yahoo's operating business, we disclosed that we believe that the August 2013
data breach previously disclosed by Y ahoo af fected all of its accounts.
The acquisitio n of Yahoo’ s operating business has been accounted for as a business combination. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined
using the income, cost, market and multiple period excess earnings approaches. The fair value measuremen ts were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable
in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, other than long-term
debt assumed in the acquisition. The income approach was primarily used to value the intangible assets, consisting primarily of acquired technology and customer
relationships. The income approach indicates value for an asset based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flow is
discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money . The cost approach, which estimates value by
determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility , was used, as appropriate, for property , plant and equipment. The cost to replace a
given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property , less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.
In June 2018, we finalized the accounting for the Yahoo acquisition. The following table summarizes the final accounting for of the assets acquired, including cash acquired of
$0.2 billion , and liabilities assumed as of the close of the acquisition, as well as the fair value at the acquisition date of Y ahoo’ s noncontrolling interests:

(1) Adjustments to the fair value measurements to reflec t new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would
have af fected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. The most significant adjustments related to an increase in goodwill and the recognition of liabilities
per certain pre-acquisition contingencies.
On the closing date of the Transaction, each unvested and outstanding Yahoo restricted stock unit award that was held by an employee who became an employee of Verizon
was replaced with a Verizon restricted stock unit award, which is generally payable in cash upon the applicable vesting date. The value of those outstanding restricted stock
units on the acquisition date was approximately $1.0 billion .
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill was
primarily attributable to increased syner gies that were expected to be achieved from the integration of Yahoo’ s operating business into our Media business. The goodwill
related to this acquisition is included within Corporate and other . See Note 4  for additional information.
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Yahoo’ s operating business from the date the acquisition closed. If the acquisition of Yahoo’ s operating business
had been completed as of January 1, 2016, the results of operations of V erizon would not have been significantly dif ferent than our previously reported results of operations.
Acquisition and Integration Related Charges
Related to the Yahoo Transaction, we recorded $0.5 billion  of acquisition  and integration related charges during the year ended December 31, 2018 , of which $0.3 billion , $0.2
billion  and an insig nificant amount are related to Severance, Integration costs and Transaction costs, respectively . In connection with the Yahoo Transaction, we recorded
acquisition and integration related charges of approximately $0.8 billion  during  the year ended December 31, 2017 , of which $0.5 billion , $0.2 billion  and $0.1 billion  related
to Seve rance, Integration costs and Transaction costs, respectively . These charges were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements
of income.
Fleetmatics Gr oup PLC
In July 2016,  we entered into an agreement to acquire  Fleetmatics Group PLC, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland (Fleetmatics ). Fleetmatics was a leading
global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions. Pursuant to the terms of the agreem ent, we acquired Fleetmatics for $60.00  per ordinary share in cash.
The aggregate mer ger consideration was approximately  $2.5 billion , including cash acquired of $0.1 billion . We completed  the acquisition on November 7, 2016.  As a result of
the transaction, Fleetmatics became a wholly-owned subsidiary of V erizon.
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Fleetmatics’ operations from the date the acquisition closed. Had this acquisition been completed on January 1,
2016, the results of operations of Verizon would not have been significantly different than our previously reported results of operations. Upon closing, we recorded
approximately $1.4 billion  of goodwill and $1.1 billion  of other intangibles.
The acquisitio n of Fleetmatics was accounted for as a business combination. The consideration was alloca ted to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair
values as of the close of the acquisition.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
recorded as a result of the Fleetmatics transaction represents future economic benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill related to this
acquisition is included within Corporate and other . See Note 4  for additional information.
Other
In July 2016, we acquired Telogis , Inc., a global cloud-based mobile enterprise manageme nt software business, for $0.9 billion  of cash consideration.  Upon closing, we
recorded $0.5 billion  of goodwill that is included within Corporate and other .
During 2018 , we entered into and completed various other transa ctions for $0.1 billion  of cash consideration. During 2017  and 2016 , we entered into and completed various
other transactions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.
Note 4. Wireless Licenses, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Wireless Licenses
The carrying amounts of W ireless licenses are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2018  2017
Wireless licenses $ 94,130  $ 88,417
For the year ended December 31, 2018 , we recorded approximately $4.5 billion  of wireless licenses in connection with the Straight Path acquisition and $0.7 billion  in
connection with the NextLink acquisition. See Note 3  for additional information.
At December 31, 2018  and 2017 , approximately $8.6 billion  and $8.8 billion , respec tively , of wireless licenses were under development for commercial service for which we
were capitalizing interest costs. We recorded approximately $0.5 billion  of capitalized  interest on wireless licenses for each of the years ended December 31, 2018  and 2017 ,
respectively .
The average remaining renewal period of our wireless license portfolio was 4.6 years as of December 31, 2018 . See Note 1  for additional information.
As discussed in Note 1, we test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indic ators are present. In 2018 , our quantitative
impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses estimated using the Greenfield approach to the aggregated carrying amount
of the licenses as of the test date. In 2017  and 2016 , we performe d a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless
licenses was less than the carrying amount. Our assessments in 2018 , 2017  and 2016  indica ted that the fair value of our wireless licenses  exceeded the carrying value and,
therefore, did not result in impairment.
Goodwill
Changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill are as follows:

Balance at December  31, 2018 $ 18,397  $ 3,871  $ 2,346  $ 24,614
We recognized goodwill of $2.1 billion  within the Media reporting unit (included within Other in the table above) as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's operating business
and $0.1 billion  in W ireline as a result of the acquisition of XO. See Note 3  for additional information.
In the fourth quarter of 2018 , we performed a quantitative impairment test for our Wireless, Wireline, Connect and Media reporting units. Based on our assessment, it was
determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying amount of each of our reporting units except for our Media reporting unit. Our Media business, Verizon Media, which
operated in 2018  under the "Oath" brand, has continued to experience increased competitive and market pressures through out 2018  that have resulted in lowe r than expected
revenues and earnings. These pressures are expected to continue and have resulted in a loss of market positioning to our competitors in the digital advertising business. Oath
has also achieved lower than expected benefits from the integration of the Y ahoo and AOL businesses.
In connection  with Verizon’ s annual budget process in the fourth quarter , the new leadership at both Oath and Verizon completed a comprehensive five-year strategic planning
review of Oath’ s business prospects resulting in unfavorable adjustments to Oath’ s financial projections. These revised projections were used as a key input into the Company’ s
annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter .
Consistent with our accounting policy , we applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including
our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the fair value of the Media reporting unit being less than its carrying amount. As a result, we
recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $4.6 billion  ($4.5 billion  after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2018  in our consolidated statement of income.
The goodwill balance of the Media reporting unit was approximately $4.8 billion  prior to the incurrence of this impairment char ge.
We performed a quantitativ e impairment assessment for all of our reporting units in 2018 and for all of our reporting units, except for our Wireless reporting unit, in 2017 and
2016 for which a qualitativ e assessment was completed.  For 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , our impairment tests indicated that the fair value for each of our Wireless, Wireline and
Connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value and therefore, did not result in a goodwill  impairment. For 2017  and 2016 , our impairm ent tests indicated that
the fair value for our Media reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore, did not result in goodwill impairment.

Tower Monetization T ransaction
During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to
lease and operate approximately 11,300  of our wirele ss towers and corresponding ground leases for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion . We have subleased capacity on the
towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew . Under  this agreement, total rent payments for the towers amounted to
$0.3 billion  for both the years ended December 31, 2018  and 2017 . We expect to make minimum future lease payments of approximately $1.8 billion . We continue to include
the towers in Property , plant and equipment , net in our consolidated balance sheets and deprecia te them accordingly . Towers related to this transaction that were included in
Property , plant and equipment, net, amounted to $0.4 billion  for both the years ended December 31, 2018  and 2017 . In addition, the minimum  future payments for the ground
leases of approximately $2.5 billion  is included in our operatin g lease commitments. As part of the rights obtained during the transaction, American Tower is responsible for
the payment of the leases, and we do not expect to be required to make payments unless American T ower defaults.

Asset-Backed Debt
As of December 31, 2018 , the carrying  value of our asset-backed debt was $10.1 billion . Our asset-ba cked debt includes notes (the Asset-Ba cked Notes) issued to third-party
investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt
bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively , the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection
with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, we transfer device payment plan agreement receivables from Cellco Partnership (Cellco) and
certain other affiliates of Verizon (collectively , the Originators) to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt.
Verizon entiti es retain the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other
related payments and expenses.
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment plan agreement
receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses
related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed
debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’ s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied.
The Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to Verizon with
respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, V erizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and
the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreem ent receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into
segregated accounts. Depo sits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other , and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-
backed debt issued and the assets securing this debt are included in our consolidated balance sheets.

December 31, 2018  was 2.520%
Under the terms of each series of Asset-Backed Notes, there is a two year revolving period during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity . The two
year revolvin g period of the Asset-Backed Notes we issued in July 2016 and November 2016 ended in July 2018 and November 2018 respectively , and we began to repay
principal on the 2016-1 Class A senior Asset-Backed Notes and the 2016-2 Class A senior Asset-Backed Notes in August 2018 and December 2018, respectively . During 2018,
we made aggregate repayments of $0.6 billion .
ABS Financing Facility
In May 2018, we entered into a second device payment plan agreement financing facility with a number of financial institutions (2018 ABS Financing Facility). Under the
terms of the 2018 ABS Financing Facility , the financi al institutions made advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement receivables of business
customers for proceeds of $0.5 billion . The loan agreement enter ed into in connection with the 2018 ABS Financing Facility has a final maturi ty date in December 2021 and
bears interest at a floating rate. There is a one year revolving period beginning from May 2018 during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity . Subject
to certain conditions, we may also remove receivable s from the ABS Entity . Under the loan agreement, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time
without penalty , but in certain cases, with breakage costs. If we choose to prepay , the amount prepaid shall be available for further drawdowns until May 2019, except in
certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2018 , the 2018 ABS Financing Facility is fully drawn and the outstanding borrowing under the 2018 ABS Financing Facility was
$0.5 billion .
We entered into an ABS Financing Facility in Septe mber 2016 with a number of financial institutions (2016 ABS Financing Facility). Under the terms of the 2016 ABS
Financing Facility, the financial institutions made advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement receivables of consumer customers. Two loan
agreements were entered into in connection with the 2016 ABS Financing Facility in September 2016 and May 2017. The loan agreements have a final maturity date in March
2021 and bear interest at floating rates. The two year revolving period of the two loan agreements ended in September 2018. Under the loan agreements, we have the right to
prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time without penalty , but in certain cases, with breakage costs. Subject to certain conditions, we may also remove receivables
from the ABS Entity . As a result of a $1.5 billion  drawdown and an aggrega te amount of $3.0 billion  of prepaymen ts and repayments , aggregate outstanding borrowings under
the two loans agreements were $0.9 billion  as of December 31, 2018.
Variable Inter est Entities
The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary as we have both the power to direct the activities of the entity
that most significantly impact the entity’ s performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity . Therefore, the assets, liabilities and
activities of the ABS Entities are consolidated in our financial results and are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated balance sheets.
The assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2018  2017

See Note 8  for additional information on device payment plan agreement receivables used to secure asset-backed debt.
Credit Facilities
In April 2018, we amended our $9.0 billion  credit facility to increase the capacity to  $9.5 billion  and extend its maturity to April 4, 2022. As of December 31, 2018, the unused
borrowing capacity under our $9.5 billion  credit facility  was approximately $9.4 billion . The credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain
specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. We use the credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit
and for general corporate purposes.
In March 2016, we entere d into a $1.0 billion  credit facility insured by Eksportkreditnamnden Stockholm, Sweden, the Swedish export credit agency . As of December 31,
2018, the outstanding balance was $0.7 billion . We used this credit facility to finance network equipment-related purchases.
In July 2017, we entered into credit facilities insured by various export credit agencies providing us with the ability to borrow up to $4.0 billion  to finance equipment-related
purchases. The facilities have borrowings available, portions of which extend through October 2019, contingent upon the amount of eligible equipment-related purchases that
we make. During 2018, we drew down $3.0 billion  from these facilities , and $2.8 billion  remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, we drew down an
additional $0.4 billion  from these facilities.
Non-Cash Transaction
During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , we financed, primarily through vendor financing arrangements, the purchase of approximately $1.1 billion , $0.5
billion , and $0.5 billion  respectively , of long-lived assets consisting primarily of network equipment. At December 31, 2018  and December 31, 2017 , $1.1 billion  and $1.2
billion , respectively , relating to these financing arrangements, including those
entered into in prior years  and liabilities assumed through acquisitions, remained outstanding. These purchases are non-cash financing activities and therefore not reflected
within Capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Early Debt Redemptions
During 2018  and 2017 , we recorded losses on early debt redemptions of $0.7 billion  and $2.0 billion , respectively .
We recognize losses on early debt redemptions in Other income (expense), net , in our consolidated statements of income and within our Net cash used in financing activities in
our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Guarantees
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018 , $0.8 billion  aggregate principal amount of these obligations remained
outstanding. Each guarantee will remain in place for the life of the obligation unless terminated pursuant to its terms, including the operating telephone company no longer
being a wholly-owned subsidiary of V erizon.
We also guarantee the debt obligations of GTE LLC, as successor in interest to GTE Corporation, that were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003. As of
December 31, 2018 , $0.4 billion  aggregate principal amount of these obligations remain outstanding.
Debt Covenants
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.
Note 8. Wireless Device Payment Plans
Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate service
on devices purchased unde r the device payment program pay lower service fees as compared to those unde r our fixed-term service plans, and their device payment plan charge
is included on their wireless monthly bill. As of January 2017, we no longer of fer consumers new fixed-term subsidized service plans for phones; however , we continue to of fer
subsidized plans to our business customers, and we also continue to service existing fixed-term subsidiz ed plans for consumers who have not yet purchased and activated
devices under the V erizon device payment program.
Wireless Device Payment Plan Agreement Receivables
The following table displays device payment plan agreement receivables, net, that continue to be recognized in our consolidated balance sheets:
 (dollars in millions)

Other assets 5,546  5,037
Device payment plan agr eement r eceivables, net $ 18,170  $ 16,101
Included in our device payment plan agreement receivables, net at December 31, 2018  and December 31, 2017 , are net device payment plan agreement receivables of $11.5
billion  and $10.7 billion , respectively , that have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be reported in our consolidate d balance sheet. See Note 7 for additional
information. W e believe the carrying value of our installment loans receivables approximate their fair value using a Level 3 expected cash flow model.
We may offer certain prom otions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the purchase of a new device. Under these types of promotions, the
customer receives a credit  for the value of the trade-in device. In addition, we may provide the customer with additional future credits that will be applied against the
customer ’s monthly bill as long as service is maintained. We recognize a liability for the trade-in device measured at fair value, which is determined by considering several
factors, including the weig hted-average selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices eligible for trade-in. Future credits are recognized when earned by the
customer . Device payment  plan agreement receivable s, net does not reflect the trade-in device liability . At December 31, 2018  and December 31, 2017 , the amount of trade-in
liability was $0.1 billion  and insignificant , respectively .
From time to time, we offer certain marketing promotions that allow our customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a certain specified portion of the required
device payment plan agreement amount as well as trading in their device in good working order . When a
customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation.
For Wireless indirect channel contracts with customer s, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement receivables. We record the imputed interest as a
reduction to the related accounts receivable. Interest income, which is included within Service revenues and other in our consolidated statements of income, is recognized over
the financed device payment term. See Note 2  for additional information on financing considerations with respect to W ireless direct channel contracts with customers.
When origina ting device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk score to measure the credit quality of a customer and to
determine eligibility for the device payment program. If a customer is either new to Verizon Wireless or has less than 210 days of customer tenure with Verizon Wireless (a
new customer ), the credit decision process relies more heavily on external data sources. If the customer has 210 days or more of customer tenure with Verizon Wireless (an
existing customer), the credit decision process relies on internal data sources. V erizon W ireless’ experience has been that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are
highly predictive for estim ating their reliability to make future payments. External data sources include obtaining a credit report from a national consumer credit reporting
agency , if available. Verizon Wireless uses its interna l data and/or credit data obtained from the credit reporting agencies to create a custom credit risk score. The custom credit
risk score is generated automatically (except with respect to a small number of applications where the information needs manual intervention) from the applicant’ s credit data
using Verizon  Wireless’ proprietary custom credit models, which are empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound. The credit risk score measures the likelihood
that the poten tial customer  will become severely delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of new customer applications, a traditional credit report
is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient credit history . In those instances, alternate credit data
is used for the risk assessment.
Based on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer to a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit including an account level spending limit and
either a maximum amount of credit allowed per device or a required down payment percentage. During the fourth quarter of 2018 Verizon Wireless moved all customers, new
and existing, from a required down payment percentage, between zero and 100% , to a maximum amount of credit per device.
Subsequent to origination, Verizon Wireless monitors delinquency and write-of f experience as key credit quality indicators for its portfolio of device payment plan agreements
and fixed-term  service plans. The extent of our collection efforts with respect to a particular customer are based on the results of proprietary custom empirically derived
internal behav ioral scoring  models that analyze the customer ’s past performance to predict the likelihood of the customer falling further delinquent. These customer scoring
models assess a number of variables, including origination characteristics, customer account history and payment patterns. Based on the score derived from these models,
accounts are grouped by risk category to determine the collection strategy to be applied to such accoun ts. We continuously monitor collection performance results and the
credit quality  of our device payment plan agreement receivables based on a variety of metrics, including aging. Verizon Wireless considers an account to be delinquent and in
default status if there are unpaid char ges remaining on the account on the day after the bill’ s due date.
The balance and aging of the device payment plan agreement receivables on a gross basis was as follows:

Sales of Wireless Device Payment Plan Agreement Receivables
In 2015 and 2016, we established programs pursuant to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (RPA) to sell from time to time, on an uncommitted basis, eligible device payment
plan agreement receivables to a group of primarily relationship banks (Purchasers) on both a revolving and non-revolving basis, collectively the Programs. In December 2017,
the RPA and all other related transaction documents were terminated. Under the Programs, eligible device payment plan agreement receivables were transferred to the
Purchasers for upfront cash proceeds and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, referred to as the deferred purchase price.
There were no sales of device payment plan agreement receivables under the Programs during 2017. During 2016, we sold $3.3 billion  of receivables, net of allowance and
imputed interest, under the Revolving Program. We received cash proceeds from new transfers of $2.0 billion  and cash proceeds from reinvested collections of $0.9 billion  and
recorded a deferred purchase price of $0.4 billion .
The sales of receivables under the RPA did not have a significant impact on our consolidated statement s of income. The cash proceeds received from the Purchasers were
recorded within Cash flows provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Deferr ed Pur chase Price
The deferred purchase price was initially recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as an Other asset at fair value, based on the remaining device payment amounts expected
to be collected, adjusted, as applicable, for the time value of money and by the timing and estimated value of the device trade-in in connection with upgrades. The estimated
value of the device trade-in considered prices expected to be offered to us by independent third parties.  This estimate contemplated changes in value after the launch of a
device. The fair value measurements were considered to be Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy . The collection of the deferred purchase price was contingent
on collections from customers. During 2017, we repurchased all outstanding receivables previously sold to the Purchasers in exchange for the obligation to pay the associated
deferred purchase price to the wholly-owned subsidiaries that were bankruptcy remote special purpose entities (Sellers). At December 31, 2017 , our deferred purchase price
receivable was fully satisfied.
Collections following the repurchase of receivables were $0.2 billion  during both 2018  and 2017 . Collections of deferred purchase price were $1.4 billion  during 2017 and $1.1
billion  during 2016. These collections were recorded in Cash flows used in investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Variable Inter est Entities
As the Programs were terminated in December 2017, VIEs related to the sale of wireless device payment plan receivables did not exist at December 31, 2018  or
December 31, 2017 .
During 2017,  under the RPA, the Sellers’ sole business consisted of the acquisition of the receivables from  Cellco and certain other affiliates of Verizon and the resale of the
receivables to the Purchasers. The assets of the Seller s were not available to be used to satisfy obligations of any Verizon entities other than the Sellers. We determined that the
Sellers were VIEs as they lack sufficient equity to finance their activities. Given that we had the power to direct the activities of the Sellers that most significantly impact the
Sellers’ economic performance, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the Sellers. As a result, we consolidated the assets and liabilities of the Sellers into our
consolidated financial statements.
Continuing Involvement
At December 31, 2018  and 2017 , the total portfolio of device payment plan agreement receivables that we were servicing was $19.3 billion  and $17.8 billion , respectively .
There were no derecognized device paym ent plan agreement receivables outstanding at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we have collected and remitted
approximately $10.1 billion , net of fees and no amounts remained to be remitted to the Purchasers.
During the year ended December 31, 2017 , Verizo n had continuing involvement with the sold receivables as it serviced the receivables. We continue d to service the customer
and their related receivables on behalf of the Purchasers, including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. While servicing the
receivables, the same policies and procedures were applied to the sold receivables that applied to owned receivables, and we continued to maintain normal relationships with
our customers. The credit quality of the customers we continued to service was consistent throughout the periods presented.
In addition, we had continuing involvement related to the sold receivables as we were responsible for absorbing additional credit losses pursuant to the agreements. Credit
losses on receivables sold were $0.1 billion  during 2017 .

offered by ASU 2016-01. Such investments are meas ured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions
for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer and are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. As of
December 31, 2018 , the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values was $0.2 billion . During 2018 , there were insignificant adjustments due to
observable price changes and we recognized an insignificant impairment char ge.
Fixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. For fixed income securities that do not have quoted prices in active markets, we use alternative
matrix pricing resulting in these debt securities being classified as Level 2.
Derivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substa ntial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified within
Level 2. W e use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis.
We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2018  and
2017 .
Fair V alue of Short-term and Long-term Debt
The fair value  of our debt is determined using variou s methods, including quoted prices for identical terms and maturities, which is a Level 1 measurement, as well as quoted
prices for similar terms and maturities in inactive markets and future cash flows discounted at current rates, which are Level 2 measurements. The fair value of our short-term
and long-term debt, excluding capital leases, was as follows:

Short- and long-term debt, excluding capital leases $ 112,159  $ 118,535  $ 116,075  $ 128,658
Derivative Instruments
The following table sets forth the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments:
   (dollars in millions)
At December 31, 2018  2017
Interest rate swaps $ 19,813  $ 20,173
Cross currency swaps 16,638  16,638
Forward starting interest rate swaps 4,000  —
Interest rate caps 2,218  2,840
Foreign exchange forwards 600  —
Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates based on the LIBOR,
resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt
issuances.  We record the interest rate swaps at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are
recorded to Interest expense, which are of fset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates.
During 2018,  we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.7 billion  and settled interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $1.1 billion . During
2017, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $7.5 billion  and settled interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.5 billion .
The inef fective portion of these interest rate swaps was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2018  and 2017 .
The following amounts were recorded in Long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2018  2017
Carrying amount of hedged liabilities $ 18,903  $ 19,723
Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the hedged liabilities (785) (316)
Cross Curr ency Swaps
We have entered into cross currency swaps designate d as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Australian Dollar -denominated cash
flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.
During 2018, a pre-tax loss of $0.7 billion  was recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) with respect to these swaps.
During 2017,  we entered into cross currency swaps with a total notional value of $14.0 billion  and settled $10.2 billion  notional amount of cross currency swaps. A pre-tax
gain of $1.4 billion  was recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) with respect to these swaps.
A portion of the gains and losses recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) was reclassified to Other income (expense), net to offset the related pre-tax foreign
currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying hedged item.
Forward Starting Inter est Rate Swaps
We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on future forecasted
transactions.
During 2018, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $4.0 billion . During 2018, a pre-tax loss of $0.1 billion  was recognized in Other
comprehensive income (loss).
We hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows of based on the expected maturities of the related forecasted debt issuance.
Net Investment Hedges
We have designated certain foreign currency instrum ents as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain
foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. The notional amount of the Euro-denomina ted debt as a net investment hedge was $0.8 billion  and $0.9 billion
at December 31, 2018  and 2017 , respectively .
Undesignated Derivatives
We also have the following derivative contracts which we use as economic hedges but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting.
Inter est Rate Caps
We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate our interest exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financing Facility and Asset-Backed Notes.  During 2017, we entered into
interest rate caps with a notional value of $0.3 billion . During both 2018  and 2017 , we recognized an insignificant amount in Interest expense.
Foreign Exchange Forwards
We enter into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchang e rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated monetary
assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries.  During 2018, we entered  into foreign exchange forwards with a total notional value of $2.8 billion  and settled foreign
exchange forwards with a total notional value of $2.2 billion .
Treasury Rate Locks
We entered into treasury rate locks with a total notion al value of $2.0 billion  to hedge the tender offers conducted in September 2018 for eight  series of notes issued by Verizon
with coupon rates ranging  from 3.850%  to 5.012%  and maturity dates ranging from 2039 to 2055 (September Tender Offers). Upon the early settlement of the September
Tender Of fers, we settled these hedges. During 2018, we recognized an insignificant loss related to treasury rate locks in Other income (expense), net .
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, short-term and long-term investments, trade receivables,
including device payment plan agreement receivables, certain notes receivable, including lease receivables and derivative contracts.
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support
annex (CSA)  agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. Our CSA agreements entered into prior to the fourth quarter of 2017 generally require collateralized
arrangements with our counterparties in connection with uncleared derivatives. During 2017, we paid an insignificant amount of cash to extend amendments to certain of our
collateral exchange arrangements, which eliminated the requirement to post collateral for a specified period of time. Additionally , during the fourth quarter of 2017, we began
negotiating and executing new ISDA master agreeme nts and CSA agreements with our counterparties. The negotiations and executions of new agreements continued in 2018.
The newly executed CSA agreements contain rating  based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in
outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. At December 31, 2018 , we posted collateral of approximately  $0.1 billion  related to
derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Prepaid expenses  and other in our consolidated balance sheet. We did not post any
collateral at  December 31, 2017 . While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that
any such nonperformance would result in a significant ef fect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.
Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation
Verizon Long-Term Incentive Plan
In May 2017, Verizon’ s shareholders approved the 2017 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated Verizon's authority to grant new awards under the Verizon
2009 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of
stock options, stock apprec iation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, perform ance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan,
Verizon reserved the number of shares that were remaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are
canceled or
otherwise terminated will also be available for the awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2018 , 89 million  shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017
Plan.
Restricted Stock Units
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three  equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock
upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting
period. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classifi ed as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs granted
under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units, which will be paid to participants at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.
In February 2018, Verizon announced a broad-based employee special award of RSUs under the 2017 Plan to eligible full-time and part-time employees. These RSUs will vest
in two equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date, and will be paid in cash.
In connection  with our acquisition of Yahoo’ s operati ng business, on the closing date of the Transaction each unvested and outstanding Yahoo RSU award that was held by an
employee who became an employee of Verizon was replaced with a Verizon RSU award, which is generall y payable in cash upon the applicable vesting date. These awards are
classified as liability awards and are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Performance Stock Units
The 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the
Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directo rs determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals
have been achieved over the three -year perform ance cycle. The PSUs are classified as liability awards because the PSU awards are paid in cash upon vesting. The PSU award
liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Verizon common stock as well as performance
relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units, which will be paid to participants at the time that PSU award is determined and
paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance goals achieved.
The following table summarizes V erizon’ s Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Stock Unit activity:

As of December 31, 2018 , unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’ s RSUs and PSUs was approximately $1.1 billion  and is expected to
be recognized over approximately two years.
The equity RSUs granted in 2018  and 2017  have weighted-average grant date fair values of $49.19  and $49.93  per unit, respectively . During 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , we paid
$0.8 billion , $0.8 billion  and $0.4 billion , respectively , to settle RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
After -tax compensation expense for stock-based comp ensation related to RSUs and PSUs described above included in Net income attributable to Verizon was $0.7 billion , $0.4
billion  and $0.4 billion  for 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively .
Note 11. Employee Benefits
We maintain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans for certain employees. In addition, we main tain postretirement health care and life insurance plans for certain
retirees and their dependents, which are both contributory and non-contributory , and include a limit on our share of
the cost for certain recent and future retirees. In accordance with our accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits, operating expenses include pension and
benefits relate d credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates, an estimated return on plan assets, and health care trend rates. These
estimates are updated in the fourth quarter to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions or upon a remeasurement. The adjustment is recognized in
the income statement during the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Pension and other postretirement benefits for certain  employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Modifications in benefits have been bargained from time to
time, and we may also periodically amend the benefi ts in the management plans. The following tables summarize benefit costs, as well as the benefit obligations, plan assets,
funded status and rate assumptions associated with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $19.6 billion  and $21.5 billion  at December 31, 2018  and 2017 , respectively .
2018 Collective Bargaining Negotiations
The extension agreement ratified in August 2018 extended our collective bargaining agreements with the Communications Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that were due to expire on August 3, 2019 for four years  until August 5, 2023.  The collective bargaining agreements cover approximately
34,000  employees. Amendments triggered by the collective  bargaining negotiations were made to certain pensio n plans for certain union represented employees and retirees.
The impact of the plan amendments was an increase in our defined benefit pension plans plan obligations and a net decrease to Accumulated other comprehensive income  of
$0.2 billion  (net of taxes  of $0.2 billion ). The annual  impact of the amount recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income  that will be reclassified to net periodic
benefit cost is minimal.
2017 Postretirement Plan Amendments
During 2017, amendments were made to certain postretirement plans related to retiree medical benefits for management and certain union represented employees and retirees. 
The impact of the plan amendments was a reduction in our postretirement benefit plan obligations of approximately $0.5 billion , which  has been recorded as a net increase to
Accumulated other comprehensive income of $0.3 billion  (net of taxes of $0.2 billion ).  The impac t of the amou nt recorded in Accumulate d other comprehensive income that
will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost is insignificant. 
2016 Collective Bargaining Negotiations
During 2016, we adopted changes to our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to reflect the agreed upon terms and conditions of the collective
bargaining agreements ratified in June 2016. The impact includes a net increase to Accumulated other comprehensive income of $2.9 billion  (net of taxes of $1.8 billion ). The
amount record ed in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period
of the respective plans’ participants, which, on a weighted-average basis, is 12.2 years  for defined benefit pension plans and 7.8 years  for other postretirement benefit plans.
The above-noted reclassification resulted in a decrease to net periodic benefit cost and increase to pre-tax  income of approximately $0.7 billion , $0.7 billion  and $0.4 billion ,
respectively , during 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Amounts reclassified to net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the reclassification to Selling, general and administrative expense of a pre-tax pension and
postretirement benefit curtailment gain of $0.5 billion  ($0.3 billion  net of taxes) due to the transfer of employees to Frontier , which caused the elimination of a significant
amount of future service in three  of our defined benefit pension plans and one of our other postretirement benefit plans requiring us to recognize a portion of the prior service
credits. See Note 3  for additional information.
The estimated prior service  cost for the defined benef it pension plans that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit (income)
cost over the next fiscal year is $0.1 billion . The estimat ed prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from Accumulated other
comprehensive income into net periodic benefit income over the next fiscal year is $1.0 billion .

The weighted-average assumptions used in determining benefit obligations follow:
 Pension   Health Car e and Life  
At December 31, 2018  2017  2018  2017
Discount Rate 4.40% 3.70% 4.30% 3.60%

The weighted-average assumptions used in determining net periodic cost follow:
 Pension   Health Car e and Life  
At December 31, 2018  2017  2016  2018  2017  2016
Discount rate in ef fect for determining service cost 4.10% 4.70% 4.50% 3.90% 4.60% 4.20%

Expected return on plan assets 7.00  7.70  7.00  4.80  4.50  4.80
Rate of compensation increases 3.00  3.00  3.00  N/A  N/A  N/A
In determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 4.40%  in 2018. The rates were selected to approximate
the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2018 . The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with
the time perio ds during which benefits payments are expected to occur , were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $0.3 billion  par
outstanding).
In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each major asset class over the subsequent 10-year
period. Those  estimates are based on a combination of factors including the current market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and historical
long-term risk premiums. To determine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset class is then weighted according to the allocation
to that investment area in the trust’ s long-term asset allocation policy .
The assumed health care cost trend rates follow:
 Health Car e and Life  
At December 31, 2018  2017  2016
Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.30% 7.00% 6.50%
Rate to which cost trend rate gradually declines 4.50  4.50  4.50
Year the rate reaches the level it is assumed to remain thereafter 2027  2026  2025
A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following ef fects:
 (dollars in millions)  
One-Percentage Point Increase  Decr ease
Effect on 2018 service and interest cost $ 20 $ (19)
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 462  (485)
Plan Assets
The company’ s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. While
target allocati on percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed so that 52.5%  of the assets have the objective of achieving a return in
excess of the growth in liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds and emer ging debt) and 45.5%  of the assets are invested as liability
hedging assets (where cash flows from investments better match projected benefit payments, typically longer duration fixed income) and 2.0%  is in cash. This allocation  will
shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to ensure they are in line with fund objectives.
Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market efficiencies and various other factors. Due to our diversification and risk control
processes, there are no significant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector , industry , geography or company names.
Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of V erizon common stock.

The following are general descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies and inputs used to determine the fair value of each major category of assets.
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds (less than 90 days to maturity), prim arily in diversified portfolios of investment grade money market
instruments and are valued using quoted market prices or other valuation methods. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature
of these investments.
Investments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or , if no
sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds , international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix
prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over -the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last
business day of the year from published sources or , if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes.
Commingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party
custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian
of the respective plan.
The investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance, and natural resource limited partnership investments. Real estate investments are valued at
amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data.
Loans secured  by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are based
upon available and current  market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultim ately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation,
estimated fair values might dif fer significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These dif ferences could be material.
Forward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last business day of the year . Both exchange
rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified by the asset class of the underlying holdings.
Hedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager . These funds are valued in accordance with the terms of their
corresponding of fering or private placement memoranda.
Commingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate limite d partnership investments for which fair value is measured using the
NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy and are included as a reconciling item to total investments.
Employer Contributions
In 2018 , we made $1.0 billion  discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans and $0.7 billion  discretionary contribution to a retiree benefit account to fund health and
welfare benefits. Qualified pension plans contributi ons are estimated to be $0.3 billion , nonq ualified pension plans contributions are estimated to be $0.1 billion , and
contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be $0.5 billion  in 2019 .
Estimated Future Benefit Payments
The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows:
   (dollars in millions)
Year Pension Benefits  Health Car e and Life
2019 $ 2,771  $ 1,086
2020 1,796  1,113
2021 1,578  1,130
2022 1,526  1,135
2023 1,500  1,137
2024 to 2028 5,008  5,689
Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We maintain four leveraged  employee stock ownersh ip plans (ESOP). We match a certain percentage of eligible employee contributions to certain savings plans with shares of
our common stock from this ESOP . At December 31, 2018 , the number of allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was 51 million . There were no unallocated shares of
common stock in this ESOP at December 31, 2018 . All leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations.
Total savings plan costs were $1.1 billion  in 2018 , $0.8 billion  in 2017  and $0.7 billion  in 2016 .
Severance Benefits
The following table provid es an analysis of our severance liability recorded in accordance with the accoun ting standard regarding employers’ accounting for postemployment
benefits:

Severance, Pension and Benefits (Cr edits) Charges
During 2018,  we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.1 billion  in accordanc e with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period
in whic h they occur . The pension and benefits remeasurement credits of $2.3 billion , which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of
income, were primarily driven by an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans
from a weighted-average of 3.7%  at December 31, 2017 to a weighted-average of 4.4%  at December 31, 2018 ( $2.6 billion ), and mortality and other assumption adjustments of
$1.7 billion , $1.6 billion  of which related to health care claims and trend adjustments, offset by the difference between our estima ted return on assets of 7.0%  and our actual
return on assets of (2.7)%  ($1.9 billion ). The credits were partially of fset by $0.2 billion  due to the ef fect of participants retiring under the voluntary separation program.
In September 2018, Verizon announced a voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees. Approximately 10,400 eligible employees will separate
from the Com pany under this program by the end of June 2019, with nearly half of these employees having exited in December of 2018. Principally as a result of this program
but also as a result of other headcount reduction initiatives, the Company recorded a severance charge of $1.8 billion  ($1.4 billion  after-tax) during the year ended December
31, 2018, which was record ed in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. During 2018, we also recorded  $0.3 billion  in severance
costs under our other existing separation plan.
During 2017,  we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges of $1.4 billion , exclusive of acquisition related severance charges, in accordance with our
accounting policy to recog nize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur . The pension  and benefits remeasurement charges of approximately $0.9 billion ,
which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our conso lidated statem ents of income, were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to
determine the current year liabilities of our pension and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 4.2%  at December 31, 2016 to a weighted-average of 3.7%  at
December 31, 2017 ($2.6 billion ). The charges were partially offset by the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0%  and our actual return on assets of 14.0%
($1.2 billion ), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven  by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2017) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.2 billion ) and other
assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion ). As part of these charges, we also recorded severance costs of $0.5 billion  under our existing separation plans, which were recorded in
Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
During 2016,  we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges of $2.9 billion  in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses
in the period in which they occur . The pension and benefits remeasurement charges of $2.5 billion , which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated
statements of income, were  primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determi ne the current year liabilities of our pension and other postretirement
benefit plans from a weigh ted-average of 4.6%  at December  31, 2015 to a weighted-average of 4.2%  at December  31, 2016 ($2.1 billion ), upda ted health care trend cost
assumptions ($0.9 billion ), the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0%  and our actual return on assets of 6.0%  ($0.2 billion ) and other assumption
adjustments ( $0.3 billion ). These charges were partially offset by a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2016) issued
by the Society of Actuarie s ($0.5 billion ) and lower negotiated prescription drug pricing ($0.5 billion ). As part of these charges, we also recorded severa nce costs of $0.4
billion  under our existing separation plans, which were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
The net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges during 2016 were comprised of a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.2 billion  measu red as of March 31,
2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in one of our define d benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension and benefits remeasurement
charge of $0.8 billion  measu red as of April 1, 2016 related to curtailment s in three  of our defined benefit pension and one of our other postretirement plans, a net pre-tax
pension and benefits remeasurement charge of $2.7 billion  measured as of May 31, 2016 in two defined benefit pension plans and three  other postretirement benefit plans as a
result of our accounting for the contractual healthcare caps and bar gained for changes, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement char ge of $0.1 billion  measured as of May 31, 2016
related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in three  of our define d benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.6
billion  measured as of August 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in five of our define d benefit pension plans, and a net pre-tax
pension and benefits credi t of $1.9 billion  as a result of our fourth quarter remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement assets and liabilities based on updated
actuarial assumptions.
Note 12. Taxes
The components of income before provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2018  2017  2016

Total 389  (14,463 ) (1,063 )
Total income tax pr ovision (benefit) $ 3,584  $ (9,956 ) $ 7,378
The following table shows the principal reasons for the dif ference between the ef fective income tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate:
Years Ended December 31, 2018  2017  2016
Statutory federal income tax rate 21.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %
State and local income tax rate, net of federal tax benefits 3.7  1.6  2.2
Affordable housing credit (0.6) (0.6) (0.7)
Employee benefits including ESOP dividend (0.3) (0.5) (0.5)
Impact of tax reform re-measurement —  (81.6 ) —
Internal restructure (9.1) (0.6) (0.7)
Noncontrolling interests (0.5) (0.6) (0.6)
Non-deductible goodwill 4.7  1.0  2.2
Other , net (0.6) (2.0) (1.7)
Effective income tax rate 18.3 % (48.3 )% 35.2 %
The ef fective income tax rate for 2018  was 18.3%  compared to (48.3)%  for 2017 . The increase in the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to
the non-recur ring, non-cash  income tax benefit of $16.8 billion  recorded in 2017  for the re-me asurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate
income tax rate, as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017 . In addition, the current period provision for income taxes includes the tax impact of the Oath
goodwill impairment charge not deductible for tax purposes, offset by the current year reduction in the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%,
effective January 1, 2018  under the TCJA and a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion  as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within
the W ireless business.
In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Com mission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 to provide guidance for companies that had not completed their
accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB 118 allowed for a provisional estimate
of the impact s of the TCJA in our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 , as well as up to a one year measurement period that ended on December 22, 2018, for any
subsequent adjustments to such provisional estimate.  Pursuant to SAB 118, Verizon recorded a provisiona l estimate of $16.8 billion  for the impacts of the TCJA, primarily due
to the re-mea surement of its U.S. deferred income tax liabilities at the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, with no significant impact from the transition tax on
repatriation, the implementation of the territorial tax system, or limitations on the deduction of interest expense. Verizon has completed its analysis of the impacts of the TCJA ,
including analyzing the effects of any Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  and U.S. Treasury guidance issued, and state tax law changes enacted, within the maximum one year
measurement period resulting in no significant adjustments to the $16.8 billion  provisional amount previously recorded.
The effective income tax rate for 2017  was (48.3)%  compa red to 35.2%  for 2016 . The decreas e in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was
primarily due to a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit recorded in 2017  as a result of the enactment of the TCJA described above.
The amounts of cash taxes paid by V erizon are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2018  2017  2016
Income taxes, net of amounts refunded $ 2,213  $ 4,432  $ 9,577
Employment taxes 1,066  1,207  1,196
Property and other taxes 1,598  1,737  1,796
Total $ 4,877  $ 7,376  $ 12,569
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
Deferred taxes arise because of dif ferences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2018  2017
Deferr ed Tax Assets    
Employee benefits $ 5,403  $ 6,174
Tax loss and credit carry forwards 3,576  4,176
Other - assets 1,650  1,938
 10,629  12,288
Valuation allowances (2,741 ) (3,293 )
Deferred tax assets 7,888  8,995
    
Deferr ed Tax Liabilities    
Spectrum and other intangible amortization 21,976  21,148
Depreciation 15,662  14,767
Other - liabilities 3,976  4,281
Deferred tax liabilities 41,614  40,196
Net deferr ed tax liability $ 33,726  $ 31,201
At December 31, 2018 , undistribute d earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. amounted to approximately $3.0 billion . The majority of
Verizon's cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent on foreign cash or earnings to meet our funding requirements, nor do we intend to
repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations.  Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that legally must be kept in
reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdiction al requirements and are unavailable for distribution or repatriation.  As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes
on these undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations. 
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
At December 31, 2018 , we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $3.6 billion  that primarily relate to state and foreign taxes.
Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $2.1 billion  will expire between 2019  and 2038 and approximately $1.5 billion  may be carried forward
indefinitely .
During 2018 , the valuation allowance decreased  approximately $0.6 billion . The balance of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2018  and the 2018  activity is primarily
related to state and foreign taxes.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
   (dollars in millions)  
 2018  2017  2016
Balance at January 1, $ 2,355  $ 1,902  $ 1,635
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 160  219  338
Additions for tax positions of prior years 699  756  188
Reductions for tax positions of prior years (248) (419) (153)
Settlements (40) (42) (18)
Lapses of statutes of limitations (55) (61) (88)
Balance at December  31, $ 2,871  $ 2,355  $ 1,902
Included in the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018 , 2017  and 2016  is $2.3 billion , $1.9 billion  and $1.5 billion , respectively , that if recognized, would
favorably af fect the ef fective income tax rate.
We recognized the following net after -tax expenses related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes:
Years Ended December 31, (dollars in millions)
2018 $ (75)
2017 (77)
2016 (25)
The after -tax accruals for the payment of interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
At December 31, (dollars in millions)
2018 $ 348
2017 269
Verizon and/or its subsidia ries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer , we are under audit
by the IRS and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years. The IRS is currently examining the Company’ s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2013-
2014 and Cellco Partnership's U.S. income tax retur n for tax year 2013-2014. Tax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2005. The amount of the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that
various curre nt tax examinations will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’ s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the possible change
cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved.
Note 13. Segment Information
Reportable Segments
We have two report able segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services, and customer
groups, respectively . We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of
segment performance.
Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following:
Segment  Description
Wireless Wireless’ communications  products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer , business and
government customers across the U.S.
Wireline Wireline’ s communications products and enhanced services include video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network
services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and
government customers both in the U.S. and around the world.
The W ireline segment is or ganized in four customer groups: Consumer Markets, which includes consumer retail customers; Enterprise Solutions, which includes large business
customers, including multinational corporations, and federal government customers; Partner Solutions, which includes other carriers that use our facilities to provide services
to their customers; and Business Markets, which includes U.S.-based small and medium business customers, state and local governments, and educational institutions.
Corporate and other includes the results of our Media business, Verizon Media, which operated in 2018  under the "Oath" brand, our telematics business, branded Verizon
Connect, and other businesses, investments in unconsolidated businesses, unallocated corporate expenses, pension and other employee benefit related costs and interest and
financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing
segment perfo rmance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings.
Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment resul ts as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker ’s
assessment of segment performance.
In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business. We are modifying our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls to
accommodate the new structure and expect to transition to the new segment reporting structure during the second quarter of 2019. W e continue to report operating results to our
chief operating decision maker under our current operating segments.
We completed our acquisition of Y ahoo's operating business on June 13, 2017.
In May 2017, we completed the Data Center Sale, where we sold 23 customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America to Equinix. The results of operations for
this divestiture and other insignificant transactions are included within Corporate and other for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent
with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .
In addition, Corporate and other includes the results of our telematics businesses for all periods presented, which were reclassified from our Wireline segment effective April 1,
2016. The impact of this reclassification was insignificant to our consolidated financial statements and our segment results of operations.
The reconciliation of segment operating revenues and expenses to consolidated operating revenues and expenses below includes the effects of special items that management
does not consider in assessing segment performance, primarily because of their nature.
We have adjusted prior period consolidated and segm ent information, where applicable, to conform to the current period presentation. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU
2017-07, "Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Perio dic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost."
Components other than the service component of net periodic pension cost and
periodic postr etirement benefit cost (income), inclusive of the mark-to-market pension and benefit remeasurements, have been reclassified from operating to non-operating
charges (benefits) in our consolidated statements of income. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 did not change how we present our segment results.
The following table provides operating financial information for our two reportable segments:

In March 2017, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million  shares of the Company's common stock. The program will
terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches  100 million , or at the close  of business on February 28, 2020, whichever is sooner . During the years ended
December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’ s common stock under our authorized share buyback programs. At December 31, 2018 ,
the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of V erizon under our share buyback program was 100 million .
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the years ended December 31, 2018 ,
2017 , and 2016 , we issued 3.5 million , 2.8 million  and 3.5 million  common shares from T reasury stock, respectively , which had an insignificant aggregate value.
Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involv ed in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal level. Where it is determined, in
consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter , the Company establishes an accrual. In none of the
currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be
made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record;
(3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously
monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. W e do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any
pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods, including the Hicksville matter described below , will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a
material ef fect on our results of operations for a given reporting period.
Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to
address contamination at the site of a former Sylvani a facility in Hicksville NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army
Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the
contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the
parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation.
Verizon is currently involved in approximately 30 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. Most of these cases are brought by non-
practicing entities and effectively seek only monetar y damages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well.
These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved.
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers
pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time,
counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and V erizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business.
Subsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was issued when the directory
business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensio ns). The preexisting guara ntee continues, without modification, despite the subsequent sale of Verizon
Information Services Canada and the spin-of f of our domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories business. The possible financial impact of the guarantee, which is not
expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably estimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may
offset each other . We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely .
As of December 31, 2018 , letters of credit totaling approximately $0.6 billion , which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing
arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.
We have several commitments, totaling $22.2 billion , primarily to purchase programming and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be
used or sold in the ordinary  course of business, from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $8.8 billion  is attributable to 2019 , $9.1 billion  is attributable to 2020  through
2021 , $2.1 billion  is attributable to 2022  through 2023  and $2.2 billion  is attributable to years thereafter . These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the
future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities or
termination amounts. Purchases against our commitments totaled approximately $9.0 billion  for 2018 , $8.2 billion  for 2017 , and $8.1 billion  for 2016 . Since the commitments
to purchase programming services from television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of
subscribers at December 31, 2018 , and applica ble rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm
commitment.

Wireless Legal Entity Restructuring
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed an internal reorganization of legal entities within the Wireless business and recorded a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of
approximately $2.1 billion  on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reduced our deferred tax liability by the same amount.
Corporate Tax Reform
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a one-time corporate tax reduction of approximately $16.8 billion  in (Provision) benefit for income taxes in our consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Verizon has completed its analysis of the impacts of the TCJA , including analyzing the effects of any IRS and U.S.
Treasury guidance issued, and state tax law changes enacted, within the maximum one year measureme nt period resulting in no significant adjustments to the provisional
amount previously recorded.
