3M COMPANY
ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K
For the Year Ended December 31, 2020
PART I
Item 1. 
Busines
s.
3M Company was incorporated in 1929 under the laws of the State of Delaware to continue operations begun in 1902. The Company’s ticker symbol is
MMM. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” includes 3M Company and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. In this document,
for any references to Note 1 through Note 20, refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Available Information
The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that
file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that the Company files with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. The Company files
annual reports, quarterly reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).
3M also makes available free of charge through its website (http://investors.3M.com) the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Exchange Act as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.
General
3M is a diversified technology company with a global presence in the following businesses
: 
Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health
Care; and Consumer. 3M is among the leading manufacturers of products for many of the markets it serves. Most 3M products involve expertise in product
development, manufacturing and marketing, and are subject to competition from products manufactured and sold by other technologically oriented
companies.
Business Segments
3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and
Consumer. 3M’s four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and
services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Financial information and other disclosures relating to 3M’s business segments and
operations in major geographic areas are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort to improve the
alignment of businesses around markets and customers. Additionally, the Company consolidated the way it presents geographic area net sales by providing
an aggregate Americas geographic region (combining former United States and Latin America and Canada areas). Also, effective in the second quarter of
2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker changed and, as a result, the Company’s disclosed
measure of segment profit/loss has been updated. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.

Distribution
3M products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous e-commerce and traditional wholesalers,
retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world. Management believes the confidence of
wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products — a confidence developed through long association with skilled marketing
and sales representatives — has contributed significantly to 3M’s position in the marketplace and to its growth.
Resources
Human Capital
On December 31, 2020, the Company employed approximately 95,000 people (full-time equivalents), with approximately 40,000 employed in the United
States and 55,000 employed internationally. The ability to recruit, retain, develop, protect, and fairly compensate its global workforce are enablers of 3M’s
success. This includes four general categories of focus: Health and Safety; Development; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; and Compensation and Benefits.
Health and Safety
3M is committed to the safety, health, and well-being of its employees. The Company continuously evaluates opportunities to raise safety and health
standards, visiting sites to identify and manage environmental health and safety risks; evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements and 3M policy;
and maintaining a global security operation for the protection of facilities and people on 3M sites. 3M also promotes a culture of health and well-being
through disease prevention programs, on-site clinical services, employee assistance programs, and comprehensive health care benefits.
Development
Developing employees contributes to growing 3M’s business. 3M maintains talent and succession planning processes, including regular review by the
Company’s chief executive officer (CEO) and reporting up through the Board of Directors. The Company has a suite of high-potential leadership
development programs which brings a consistent approach to leadership development. 3M also has development programs for managers and supervisors
and provides learning opportunities for all employees. With the Company’s global online employee learning platform, employees are able to access unique,
just-in-time development resources in over 15 languages to support their career aspirations and advance their skills.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
A diverse, global workforce and inclusive culture that provides fair and equitable opportunities helps 3M remain competitive, advance its innovation
culture, and serve customers. 3M focuses on attracting and advancing top talent and has publicly committed to advance global diversity in management
across all dimensions, with additional specific goals to continue advancing pay equity and to increase the Company’s diversity with underrepresented
groups. 3M supports these values with an internal CEO Inclusion Council, a forum led by senior management to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion
initiatives. The Company also plans to invest $50 million over 2020 to 2025 to address racial opportunity gaps through workforce development initiatives in
the communities in which its employees live and 3M business operates.
Compensation and Benefits
In addition to a professional work environment that promotes innovation and rewards performance, 3M’s total compensation for employees includes a
variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and
comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company’s goals with both
short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives. Through its global pay philosophy, principles and consistent implementation, 3M is
committed to providing fair and equitable pay for employees. Eligible full-time employees in the United States also have access to medical, dental, and
vision plans; savings and retirement plans; a 3M employee stock purchase plan; and other resources. Some of these benefits can also be available to regular
part-time employees who work at least 20 hours a week. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons,
Table of Contents
7
such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade unions, and other employee representative bodies.
Raw Materials
In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused fluctuations in supply markets. Generally, as demand for certain COVID-related products surged,
3M saw a corresponding tightening in supply and some degree of price inflation in associated markets. Within the supply chain of less essential products,
3M experienced raw material price deflation as economies slowed and certain producers scaled back or idled operations. Conversely, as markets re-opened
and demand increased, the Company experienced raw material price inflation with some level of stabilization late in the year.
The Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input
management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. Overall, on a consolidated basis, 3M experienced net raw material price deflation in 2020. To
date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict
future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful
management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply
sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. In addition, 3M evaluates suppliers’
conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
The Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign
patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. Patents
applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in
the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon
the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
The Company believes that its trademarks, patents, and trade secrets provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no
single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments.
Government Regulation and Environmental Law Compliance
The Company’s business operations are subject to various governmental regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including, among others, those related
to product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, U.S. trade
sanctions, regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and
regulations, such as the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws and the Sunshine Act.
3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws and regulations around the world. The Company places
consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable
laws and regulations. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to
“Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).
Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed.
Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally
no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental
expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
In 2020, 3M expended approximately $55 million on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. Capital projects for environmental
purposes include waste reduction and pollution control programs such as, water usage reduction and water quality
Table of Contents
8
improvement equipment, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers. Capital expenditures for similar projects are
presently expected to approach approximately $400 million for 2021 and 2022 in aggregate.
Although an estimate of certain nearer-term capital expenditures is provided above, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of compliance
with government regulations (including environmental regulations) will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Risks Related to the Global Economy and Public Health Crises
* The Company’s results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade and other external
conditions.
 
Table of Contents
11
The Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States, and, accordingly, the
Company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as disruptions in financial markets, economic
downturns, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures,
government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates;
social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, or exchange
control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Climate change, as well as related
environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural
resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we
operate.
* The Company is subject to risks related to public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with
 
the coronavirus (COVID-19). 
3M, as a global company, is impacted by public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with COVID-19. The outbreak has significantly
increased economic and demand uncertainty. In addition, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as
the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working, have impacted 3M’s operations. In these challenging and dynamic circumstances,
3M continues to work to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its operations, including ensuring the safety and
protection of approximately 50,000 people who work in our plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and
delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted 3M’s supply chains relative to global demand for
products like respirators, surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions. Even with 3M’s accelerated production at its global facilities combined with
capacity from other manufacturers, the industry-wide challenge is that global demand for N95 and other respirators continues to exceed the industries’
ability to deliver. Within individual regions and countries around the world, 3M is working with governments, distributors and others to prioritize supplies
to the most critical customer and public health needs. 3M’s manufacturing, supply chain and distribution protocols have, for example, been impacted by the
need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act. In addition, trade
barriers, export restrictions and other similar measures imposed by national governments also negatively impact the supplies of personal protection
equipment including those made by 3M going into the most needed areas. COVID-19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide
products and services to 3M. Some of these COVID-related factors have increased demand for certain 3M products, while others have decreased demand
from certain end markets or could make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. 3M has received reports of price gouging, counterfeiting and other
illegal or fraudulent activities involving its N95 respirators, has taken legal action in several states and continues to work with state, federal and
international law enforcement to protect the public and 3M against those who seek to exploit 3M’s brand and reputation and defraud others. Furthermore,
COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper
functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. For example, COVID-19 has led to disruption and
volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital. As economies start to reopen in
certain parts of the world, workplace safety, for the Company and others, will increasingly become a focus of concern. As part of the return to work process
at the Company, the Company could face additional privacy and data security risks related to the collection of data regarding employees and contractors
with respect to COVID-19 testing, temperature checks, and contact tracing. Due to the speed and scope with which the COVID situation is developing and
evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3M is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic
may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and
earnings. 
Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company’s revenues are derived from
outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely
affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
* 
The Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.
Table of Contents
12
As previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
substances produced by the Company, collectively known as “PFAS.” The PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and
materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the
carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS critical to the manufacture of
electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes.
Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology. PFAS compounds are manufactured by various companies, including
3M, and are used in everyday products. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that
PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate
(PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. We phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and
surfactant products, with most of these activities in the U.S. completed by the end of 2002. Phased out products included Aqueous Film Forming Foam
(AFFF) and coatings for food packaging, for example. 3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and
is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of
jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An adverse outcome in
any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results. For example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal
fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the
presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. Governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving
PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies,
as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing
facilities or otherwise.
* The Company’s future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including
those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws,
U.S. trade sanctions compliance, regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare
program-related laws and regulations including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, the Sunshine Act, or other matters.
 
Legal compliance risks also
include third-party risks where the Company’s suppliers, vendors or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3M’s Supplier
Responsibility Code, 3M performance requirements or with legal requirements.
The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are
often difficult to reliably predict. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these
risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change
current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of
reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable
law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. In addition, negative publicity related to product liability, environmental, health and
safety or other matters referenced above involving the Company may negatively impact the Company’s reputation. For a more detailed discussion of the
legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,”
within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Risks Related to Our Products and Customer Preferences
* The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.
 
Demand for the Company’s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of
competitive products; (ii) the Company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the
levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the
Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our products, including the
success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company’s
products; and (v) changes in the
Table of Contents
13
business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from
increasing volume of available data.
* The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to
continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.
 
This ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual
property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.
* The Company’s future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components,
compounds, raw materials and energy, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, natural disasters and
other disruptive factors.
 
The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by
others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage,
climate impacts, natural and other disasters and other disruptive events, or be terminated. Any sustained interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate
supplies or disruption to key manufacturing sites’ operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a
process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price
fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Risks Related to Our Business
* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource
planning (ERP) system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the
Company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its
customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s business and reputation. 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided,
hosted or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of
businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or
personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our
cybersecurity and business continuity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance,
and backup of systems and data), the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially vulnerable to the security risks of
our vendors and third-party service providers, security breaches, damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by threat actors including nation-state
actors, computer viruses, hardware, software, and system vulnerabilities, ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, employee
error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The Company’s
increased adoption of remote working, which was driven by the pandemic, may also introduce additional threats to our information technology networks
and infrastructure. Despite our cybersecurity measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended time period, up to and
including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and disruptions to the Company’s information technology
infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. Any such threats or disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings,
liability or penalties under privacy laws, interference with the Company’s operations, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely
affect the Company’s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be
no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.
* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business
strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. 
The Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances,
divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, including, for example, the recently completed acquisition of Acelity,
Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries (a leading global medical technology company), future results will be affected by the Company’s ability to integrate acquired
businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies. The Company
Table of Contents
14
realigned from five to four business segments, effective in April of 2019, to better serve its global customers and markets. Successful execution of the
realignment and the associated adjustments of our portfolio and business operating model, as well as other organizational changes, will be important to the
Company’s future results.
* The Company’s future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity
improvements than estimated.
 
The Company’s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The Company utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six
Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service
delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers
with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system. There can be no assurance that all
of the projected productivity improvements will be realized. In addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes and agility to respond to
customer needs and service expectations are important, which, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the Company’s ability to win new business
and enhance revenue and 3M’s brand. Operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements,
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial conditions and results of operations.
Risks Related to Financial and Capital Markets and Tax Matters
* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.
 
The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in
market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined
benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.
* Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.
 
The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign
debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency
with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody’s Investors Service
and an A+ credit rating with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor’s. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and
facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Company’s capital structure could impact 3M’s credit ratings in the future.
Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to
capital markets.
* Changes in tax rates, laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial results.
 
The Company’s business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the U.S.
and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, assessment and enforcement approaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory
developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation and/or regulations around the world could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the
Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In connection with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to
certain types of income may be subject to potential change. Due to uncertainty of the regulation changes and other tax-related factors stated above, it is
currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements.

Item 5. 
Market for Registrant’
s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
Equity compensation plans’ information is incorporated by reference from Part III, Item 12, “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management and Related Stockholder Matters,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Item 5. At January 31, 2021, there were
68,372 shareholders of record. 3M’s stock ticker symbol is MMM and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE), the Chicago Stock
Exchange, Inc., and the SWX Swiss Exchange. Cash dividends declared and paid totaled $1.47 and $1.44 per share for each quarter in 2020 and 2019,
respectively. 3M typically declares and pays dividends in the same quarter.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Repurchases of 3M common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In
November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program
authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date.

3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. As more fully described in both the
Performance by Business Segment section in MD&A and in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment
reporting in its continuing effort to improve the alignment of businesses around markets and customers. Additionally, the Company consolidated the way it
presents geographic area net sales by providing an aggregate Americas geographic region (combining former United States and Latin America and Canada
areas). Also, effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker changed
and, as a result, the Company’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss has been updated. Business segment information presented herein reflects the
impact of these changes for all periods presented.
3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. From a
geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.
Consideration of COVID-19:
3M is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). The Company updated its risk factors with respect
to COVID-19, which can be found in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this document.
Public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of
remote working, have impacted 3M’s operations. 3M continues to work to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its
operations, including ensuring the safety and protection of people who work in its plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support
the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted 3M’s supply chains relative to
global demand for products like respirators, surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions. As this situation continues, 3M also closely monitors and
responds to potential impacts to the Company’s broader supply chain associated with other products. COVID-19 has also affected the ability of suppliers
and vendors to provide products and services to 3M. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted the broader economies of affected countries, including
negatively impacting economic growth.The Company has taken steps to help employees lead safe and productive lives during the outbreak including
remote working; escalated procedures in factories related to personal safety, cleaning and medical screening measures; and pandemic leave policies. 3M
closely monitors how the spread of COVID-19 is affecting employees and business operations and has preparedness plans to help protect the safety of
employees around the world while safely continuing business. While nearly all of our manufacturing locations and distribution centers are fully or partially
operational, the Company

19
implemented plant and/or line shutdowns during 2020 related to certain markets due to weaker customer demand or government mandates. Some of the
above factors have increased the demand for 3M products, while others have decreased demand or made it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. Serving
3M customers is a priority and teams continue to communicate with individual customers about potential disruptions.
3M’s total sales increased 0.1% for the full year 2020 when compared to 2019. Organic local-currency sales decreased 1.7% for the full year 2020 when
compared to 2019. Given the diversity of 3M’s businesses, the impact of COVID-19 varied across the Company throughout 2020. 3M experienced strong
sales growth in personal safety, as well as in other areas such as home improvement, general cleaning, semiconductor, data center, and biopharma filtration.
COVID-related respirator sales are estimated to have impacted year-on-year organic local-currency sales growth by approximately 3 percent for the year
ending December 31, 2020. At the same time, weakness in several end markets, while improving, contributed in part to sales declines in a number of 3M’s
businesses with the biggest year-on-year total sales decreases in oral care (down 19 percent), advanced materials (down 17 percent), automotive and
aerospace (down 16 percent), commercial solutions (down 14 percent), stationery and office (down 11 percent), closure and masking (down 11 percent),
automotive aftermarket (down 10 percent), and businesses aligned to general industrial applications such as abrasives (down 15 percent) and industrial
adhesives and tapes (down 5 percent).
3M’s operating income margins increased 3.1 percentage points year-on-year for the year ending December 31, 2020. Factoring out the impact on
operating income of special items as described in the 
Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)
 section below, operating income
margins increased 0.1 points to 21.3 percent for the year ending December 31, 2020 when compared to 2019. Various COVID-19 implications contributed
in part to these results.
Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3M’s consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for
products and disruption in global supply chains as described above. While it is not feasible to identify or quantify all the other direct and indirect
implications on 3M’s results of operations, below are factors that 3M believes have also affected its 2020 results:
Factors contributing to charges:
●
Period expenses of unabsorbed manufacturing costs and increased expected credit losses on customer receivables.
●
Restructuring actions addressing structural enterprise costs and operations in certain end markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related
economic impact resulting in a second quarter 2020 charge of $58 million (as further discussed in Note 5).
●
Committed financial support to various COVID-relief and medical research initiatives.
●
Charge of $22 million related to equity securities as discussed in the “
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring
Basis”
 section of Note 15 that use the measurement alternative described therein in addition to an immaterial pre-tax charge related to impairment
of certain indefinite lived tradenames in the first quarter of 2020. 3M continues to regularly consider if COVID-19 and other related market
implications could indicate it is more likely than not the carrying amount of various applicable assets may be impaired and assess whether certain
investments without readily determinable fair values may have been impacted.
Factors providing benefits or other impacts:
●
Decreased discretionary spending in areas such as travel, professional services, and advertising/merchandising as well as 
cost reduction efforts,
hiring freezes, and maintaining only essential contract workers. 3M continues to monitor discretionary spending and deploy cost control efforts as
the situation continues.
●
Government-sponsored COVID-response stimulus and relief initiatives, including certain employment retention benefits under the 
Coronavirus Aid,
Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the United States.
●
Lower self-insured medical visit/instance expense during 2020.
●
Instituted accelerated vacation usage policies which benefited the second quarter of 2020 year-on-year, but provided a penalty in comparison to
prior year in the second half of 2020.
As previously disclosed, in light of circumstances, 3M took actions to ensure sources of cash may remain strong, including the March 2020 issuance of
$1.75 billion of registered notes, suspension of share repurchases, and the decrease of its 2020 capital spending to approximately $1.5 billion. While capital
spending decreased, it included additional expansion of respirator production capacity. 3M continues to have access to its commercial paper program and
undrawn committed credit facility. Refer to the Financial Condition and Liquidity section below for more information on the Company’s liquidity position.

20
The Company also continues to evaluate the extent to which it may avail itself of various government-sponsored COVID-response stimulus, relief, and
production initiatives around the world, such as under the Defense Production Act (DPA) and CARES Act in the United States. During 2020 and into
January 2021, 3M reached certain agreements with governments in the U.S. and other countries involving just over $250 million of asset funding to expand
capacity to supply N-95 respirators.
Due to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3M is not
able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.

Year 2020 EPS:
For year ended December 31, 2020, net income attributable to 3M was $5.384 billion, or $9.25 per diluted share basis, compared to $4.570 billion, or $7.81
per diluted share, for year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 18.4 percent on a per diluted share basis.
The Company refers to various “adjusted” amounts or measures on an “adjusted basis”. These exclude special items. These non-GAAP measures are
further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the 
Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP
measures)
 section below.
On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to 3M was $5.088 billion, or $8.74 per diluted share for 2020 compared to $5.193 billion, or $8.88 per diluted
share in December 31, 2019, a decrease of 1.5 percent on a per diluted share basis.
Additional discussion related to the components of the year-on-year change in earnings per diluted share follows:
Organic growth/productivity and other:
●
Lower organic volume growth in 2020 as a result of significant COVID-19 related impacts, in addition to COVID-related net factors described in
the preceding Overview—Consideration of COVID-19 section, decreased earnings per diluted share year-on-year. 3M also experienced year-over-
year increased costs as a result of the regular review of its respirator mask
Table of Contents
21
liabilities and certain follow-on accelerated depreciation following some of the restructuring described below. Partially offsetting this net decrease
in earnings per share were year-on-year net gains related to certain property sales (in 2020 within Safety and Industrial and in 2019 within Corporate
and Unallocated) in addition to benefits recognized in 2020 related to the restructuring and other actions taken in 2019 (and the adjustments thereto
in 2020) along with continued cost management and productivity efforts.
●
On a combined basis, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost increased expense year-on-year.
●
Interest expense (net of interest income) increased in 2020, as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances and lower year-on-year interest income
driven by lower average interest rates on cash balances. 2020 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment charge in conjunction with
the repayment of notes in December 2020.
Non divestiture-related restructuring actions:
●
3M recorded non divestiture-related restructuring pre-tax charges aggregating $195 million in 2020. These included charges in the second quarter of
2020 to address certain COVID-related impacts and in the fourth quarter as 3M initiated actions to further enhance its operational and marketing
capabilities. In 2019, charges included $282 million as the Company committed to actions in light of slower than expected 2019 sales and associated
with realigning its organizational structure and operating model. See Note 5 for additional details.
●
The year-on-year impact of the non divestiture-related restructuring actions taken in 2020 and 2019 increased earnings per diluted share by 12 cents.
Acquisitions/divestitures:
●
Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate to the acquisitions of M*Modal (first quarter 2019), and
Acelity (fourth quarter 2019). These items collectively decreased earnings per diluted share by 7 year-on-year for 2020. The net impacts related to
these acquisitions included income from operations, more than offset by transaction and integration costs. Financing costs related to these
acquisitions is also included.
●
Divestiture impacts include the lost operating income from divested businesses, which decreased earnings per diluted share by 3 cents year-on-year
for 2020. This was primarily related to the divestiture of the Company’s drug delivery business.
Foreign exchange impacts:
●
Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings year-on-year by approximately $81 million in 2020, which decreased earnings
per diluted share by 11 cents, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates.
Income tax rate
:
●
Certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rate for 2020 was 19.6 percent, a decrease of 0.2
percentage points versus 2019. On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rate increased 0.1 percentage points year-on-year for
2020.
●
Factors that decreased the effective tax rate for 2020 included geographical income mix and adjustments to uncertain tax positions. These decreases
were partially offset by 
decreased benefit from stock options
.
 
Refer to Note 10 for additional details.
Shares of common stock outstanding:
●
Lower shares outstanding increased earnings per share year-on-year by 4 cents per diluted share for 2020. Weighted-average diluted shares
outstanding in 2020 declined 0.5 percent year-on-year, which benefited earnings per share. The decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted
shares relates to the Company’s purchase of $368 million of its own stock, prior to suspension of share repurchases under its board-approved stock
repurchase program in late March 2020 with other repurchase activity limited to 3M’s stock compensation plans.
Year 2019 EPS:
Organic growth/productivity and other:
●
Negative organic local-currency sales growth as a result of softness in certain end markets and channel inventory adjustments, along with actions
taken by 3M in response to lower sales volumes and high inventory levels, which resulted in lower manufacturing and inventory absorption, reduced
earnings per diluted share. Partially offsetting these impacts were benefits from restructuring actions taken in the second quarter of 2019.
Table of Contents
22
●
Defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense decreased expense year-on-year, which benefited earnings per diluted share.
●
Lower income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense, increased expense year-on-year.
●
Interest expense (net of interest income) increased in 2019, as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances, partially offset by the increase in interest
income driven by higher balances in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during the year resulting from the proceeds from debt
issuances in advance of the October 2019 Acelity acquisition.
Non divestiture-related restructuring actions:
●
During the second quarter of 2019, in light of slower than expected 2019 sales, and additionally in the fourth quarter to realign
 
3M’s organizational
structure and operating model, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions. In aggregate, the Company recorded
a full year 2019 combined pre-tax charge of $282 million, or 41 cents per diluted share. See Note 5 for additional details.
Acquisitions/divestitures:
●
Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate to the acquisitions of M*Modal (first quarter 2019), and
Acelity (fourth quarter 2019). These items collectively decreased earnings per diluted share by 19 cents year-on-year for 2019. The net impacts
related to these acquisitions included income from operations, more than offset by transaction and integration costs. Interest expense related to
financing costs of these acquisitions is also included. Expenses related to the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity also include financing costs and
the tax effect of repatriating funds in advance of the close of the acquisition.
●
Divestiture impacts collectively decreased earnings per diluted share by 5 cents year-on-year for 2019. They include remaining stranded costs and
lost operating income related to the 2018 divestiture of the Communication Markets Division, which decreased earnings per diluted share by 4 cents
year-on-year, and lost operating income from other divested businesses (primarily the Company’s gas and flame detection business), which
decreased earnings per diluted share by 1 cent year-on-year.
Foreign exchange impacts:
●
Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) were essentially flat year-on-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates.
Income tax rate
:
●
Certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rate for 2019 was 19.8 percent, a decrease of 3.6
percentage points versus 2018. On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rate increased 0.2 percentage points year-on-year for
2019.
●
Factors that decreased the effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for 2019 included prior year measurement period adjustments related to 2017 Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act (TCJA), prior year resolution of the NRD lawsuit (as described in Note 16) and geographical income mix. These decreases were
partially offset by the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary, adjustments to uncertain tax positions, and significant litigation-related charges.
Refer to Note 10 for additional details.
Shares of common stock outstanding:
●
Lower shares outstanding increased earnings per share year-on-year by 22 cents per diluted share for 2019. Weighted-average diluted shares
outstanding in 2019 declined 2.8 percent year-on-year which benefited earnings per share. The decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted
shares relates to the Company’s purchase of $1.4 billion of its own stock in 2019.

Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures):
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of
special items. For the periods presented, special items include the items described below. Beginning in 2020, the Company includes gain/loss on sale of
businesses and divestiture-related restructuring actions as special items due to their potential distortion of underlying operating results. Information provided
herein reflects the impact of this change for all periods presented. Operating income (measure of segment operating performance), income before taxes, net
income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and a measure adjusted for
special items. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP
measures in evaluating and managing the Company’s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for these items is meaningful to
investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Special items include:
Significant litigation-related charges/benefits:
●
In 2020, 3M recorded a net pre-tax charge of $17 million ($13 million after tax) related to PFAS (certain perfluorinated compounds) matters. The
charge was more than offset by a reduction in tax expense of $52 million related to resolution of tax treatment with authorities regarding the
previously disclosed 2018 agreement reached with the State of Minnesota that resolved the Natural Resources Damages lawsuit. These items, in
aggregate, resulted in a $39 million after tax benefit.
●
In 2019, the Company recorded significant litigation-related charges of $762 million ($590 million after tax) related to PFAS matters and coal mine
dust respirator mask lawsuits of which $214 million ($166 million after tax) occurred in the fourth quarter. The aggregate 2019 pre-tax charge was
reflected in cost of sales ($328 million) and selling, general and administrative expense ($434 million). These charges are further discussed in Note
16.
●
In 2018, the Company recorded significant litigation-related charges of $897 million ($770 million after tax) for PFAS matters related to the
previously disclosed agreement reached with the State of Minnesota that resolved the Natural Resource Damages lawsuit. Essentially all of the
aggregate 2018 pre-tax charge was reflected in selling, general and administrative expense.
Gain/loss on sale of businesses:
●
In the first quarter of 2020, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2 million ($1 million loss after tax) related to the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection
business and recognition of certain contingent consideration. In the second quarter of 2020, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $387 million ($304
million after tax) related to the sale of its drug delivery business. Refer to Note 3 for further details.
●
In the first quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a gain related to the sale of certain oral care technology comprising a business in addition to reflecting an
earnout on a previous divestiture, which together resulted in a net gain of $8 million ($7 million after tax). In the second quarter of 2019, as a result
of a “held for sale” tax benefit related to the legal entities associated with the pending divestiture of the Company’s gas and flame detection
business, 3M recorded an after-tax gain of $43 million. In the third quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a gain related to the divestiture of the Company’s
gas and flame detection business and an immaterial impact as a result of measuring a disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value
less cost to sell, which in aggregate resulted in a pre-tax gain of $106 million ($79 million after tax).
●
In the first quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a gain related to the sale of 
certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise,
environmental, and heat stress monitoring, the sale of
 its polymer additives compounding business, and a gain on final closing adjustments from a
prior divestiture which, in aggregate, resulted in a net pre-tax gain of $24 million ($19 million after tax). In the second quarter of 2018, 3M recorded
a pre-tax gain of $12 million ($10 million after tax) related to the sale of its abrasive glass products business. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 3M
recorded a gain of $2 million related to an earnout from a previous divestiture. Additionally, in 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of
its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $509 million ($410 million after tax).
Divestiture-related restructuring actions:
●
In the second quarter 2020, following the divestiture of substantially all of the drug delivery business (see Note 3) management approved and
committed to undertake certain restructuring actions addressing corporate functional costs and manufacturing footprint across 3M in relation to the
magnitude of amounts previously allocated/burdened to the divested business. As a result, 3M recorded a second quarter 2020 pre-tax charge of $55
million ($46 million after tax) and made a subsequent immaterial adjustment thereto. Refer to Note 5 for further details.
Table of Contents
24
●
During 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions as further described in Note 5, related to addressing
corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture resulting in a 2018 pre-tax charge of $127 million ($110
million after tax), net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates of $10 million.
Loss on deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiary:
●
In the second quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $162 million related to the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary
as further discussed in Note 1.
Measurement period accounting for TCJA:
●
3M recorded a net tax expense of $176 million in 2018 as a measurement period adjustment to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA). See Note 10 for additional information.

Additional information beyond what is included in the preceding table is as follows:
●
In the Americas geographic area, U.S. total sales increased 2 percent and organic-local currency decreased 1 percent. Total sales remained flat in
Mexico, as organic local-currency sales increases of 1 percent were partially offset by lost sales from divested businesses and foreign currency
translation impacts. In Canada, total sales and organic local currency increased 3 percent. In Brazil, total sales decreased 4 percent, as organic local-
currency sales growth of 3 percent was more than offset by foreign currency translation impacts.
●
In the Asia Pacific geographic area, China total sales decreased 7 percent and organic local-currency sales decreased 4 percent. In Japan, total sales
decreased 2 percent and organic local currency sales decreased 3 percent.
Foreign currency translation decreased year-on-year sales by 1.7 percent, while selling prices increased by 0.6 percent year-on-year for 2019, with price
growth in EMEA and Americas, while Asia Pacific was flat.
Managing currency risks:
The stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2020 compared to the same period last year. Net of the Company’s hedging strategy,
foreign currency negatively impacted earnings for full year 2020 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to hedge currency
risk related to earnings. 3M uses natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency and hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of
supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using
a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more
limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3M’s
hedging approach is
Table of Contents
28
designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3M’s businesses to respond to changes in the
marketplace.
Financial condition:
3M generated $8.1 billion of operating cash flow in 2020, an increase of $1.0 billion when compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to cost
saving actions taken in response to COVID-19 and lower year-on-year significant litigation-related charges and the timing of associated payments. This
followed an operating cash flow increase of $631 million when comparing 2019 to 2018. Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition and Liquidity”
later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.
In November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new
program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2020, the Company
purchased $0.4 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $1.4 billion in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $7.8 billion remained
available under the authorization. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company suspended repurchases under its board-approved share repurchase program with
other repurchase activity limited to 3M’s stock compensation plans. The Company plans to resume share purchases in 2021. In February 2021, 3M’s Board
of Directors declared a first-quarter 2021 dividend of $1.48 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 63
rd
 consecutive year of dividend increases
for 3M.
Raw materials:
In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused fluctuations in supply markets. Generally, as demand for certain COVID-related products surged,
3M saw a corresponding tightening in supply and some degree of price inflation in associated markets. Within the supply chain of less essential products,
3M experienced raw material price deflation as economies slowed and certain producers scaled back or idled operations. Conversely, as markets re-opened
and demand increased, the Company experienced raw material price inflation with some level of stabilization late in the year.
In response, the Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges,
including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. Overall, on a consolidated basis, 3M experienced net raw material deflation in
2020. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult
to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations
through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of
additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. In addition, 3M
evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.
Pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:
On a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2020. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is
approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 91 percent funded and the international pension plans were 93 percent funded. The U.S.
non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2020 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were
13.6%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified
pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2021 is 6.50%. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2020
discount rate was 2.55%, down 0.70 percentage points from the year-end 2019 discount rate of 3.25%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an
increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan’s funded status decreased 1 percentage point in 2020
due to the higher PBO resulting from the discount rate decrease and partially offset by higher return on assets. Additional detail and discussion of
international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).
3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2021. The
Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2021. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and
postretirement expense in 2021 to decrease by approximately $40 million pre-tax when

compared to 2020. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional
information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans.

Operating income margins increased year over year for 2020. The increase from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by lower significant litigation-related
charges and higher gains on divestitures (net of divestiture-related restructuring actions) year-on-year. These items are further described in the 
Certain
amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)
 section above. A number of factors impact the various income statement line items. Expanded
discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below.
In 2020 the Company’s operating expenses were impacted by factors described in the preceding Overview – Consideration of COVID-19 section above.
In 2020 and 2019, 3M approved and committed to certain restructuring actions that impacted cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D (see Note 5 for additional
details). In addition to actions related to divestitures (as discussed earlier in the 
Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)
 section),
for 2020 these included charges to address certain COVID-related impacts and actions to further enhance its operational and marketing capabilities. In
2019, charges included actions in light of slower than expected 2019 sales and associated with realigning its organizational structure and operating model.
Pension and postretirement service cost expense is recorded in cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. In total, 3M’s defined benefit pension and postretirement
service cost expense increased $31 million in 2020. Refer to Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for the service cost components of net periodic
benefit costs.
The Company is investing in an initiative called business transformation, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. Business
transformation encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, as well
as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M.
Cost of Sales:
Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.
Cost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased during 2020 when compared to 2019. Decreases were related to lower significant litigation-related
charges taken in 2020, which were partially offset by 2020 COVID-related net impacts, including period expenses of unabsorbed manufacturing costs, in
addition to higher restructuring action charges taken in 2020 along with certain related follow-on accelerated depreciation. In addition, selling prices
increased year-on-year by 0.6 percent for full year 2020, and lower raw material costs reduced cost of sales as a percentage of sales.
Table of Contents
30
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:
SG&A in dollars decreased slightly in 2020 when compared to 2019. The decrease was driven by cost saving actions taken in response to COVID-19, in
addition to benefits from prior year restructuring (and adjustments thereto in 2020). Additional factors that decreased SG&A in 2020 also include lower
year-on-year impact related to significant litigation-related charges. In terms of SG&A as a percent of sales, partially offsetting these decreases was the
overall effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sales that resulted in higher costs as a percent of sales. SG&A was also impacted by increased spending year-
on-year related to Acelity, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Research, Development and Related Expenses:
R&D in dollars decreased slightly in 2020 when compared to 2019 and remained relatively consistent as a percent of sales at 5.8% in 2020 compared to
5.9% in 2019. 3M continued to invest in its key initiatives, including R&D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new
markets and disrupt existing markets. Incremental R&D spending in 2020 included activities related to the Acelity business acquired in the fourth quarter of
2019. 3M also experienced lower year-on-year restructuring activities impacting R&D.
Gain on Sale of Businesses:
During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $2 million ($1 million loss after tax) related to the sale of its advanced ballistic-
protection business and recognition of certain contingent consideration. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $387
million ($304 after tax) related to the sale of substantially all of its drug delivery business.
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company sold certain oral care technology comprising a business and reflected an earnout on a previous divestiture
resulting in a pre-tax gain of $8 million ($7 million gain after tax). In the third quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a gain related to the divestiture of the
Company’s gas and flame detection business and an immaterial impact as a result of measuring a disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair
value less cost to sell, which in aggregate resulted in a pre-tax gain of $106 million ($79 million after tax). Refer to Note 3 for additional details on
divestitures.
Operating Income Margin:
3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Refer to the table below for a reconciliation of operating
income margins for 2020 and 2019.

Year 2020 operating income:
Operating income margins increased 3.1 percentage points in 2020 when compared to 2019. Factoring out the impact on operating income of special items
as described in the 
Certain amounts adjusted for special items – (non-GAAP measures) 
section above, operating margins increased 0.1 percentage points to
21.3 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019.
Additional discussion related to the components of the year-on-year change in operating income margins follows:
Organic volume/productivity and other:
●
Lower organic volume growth in 2020 as a result of significant COVID-19 related impacts, in addition to COVID-related net factors described in
the preceding Overview—Consideration of COVID-19 section, decreased operating income margins year-on-year. 3M also experienced year-over-
year increased costs as a result of the regular review of its respirator mask liabilities and certain follow-on accelerated depreciation following some
of the restructuring described below. Partially offsetting this net decrease were year-on-year net gains related to certain property sales (in 2020 with
Safety and Industrial and in 2019 within Corporate and Unallocated) in addition to benefits recognized in 2020 related to the restructuring and other
actions taken in 2019 (and the adjustments thereto in 2020) along with continued cost management and productivity efforts.
●
Operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense.
Non divestiture-related restructuring actions:
●
3M recorded non divestiture-related restructuring charges that impacted operating income aggregating $195 million in 2020. These included
charges in the second quarter of 2020 to address certain COVID-related impacts and in the fourth quarter as 3M initiated actions to further enhance
its operational and marketing capabilities. In 2019, charges included $246 million impacting operating income (and $36 million impacting other
expense (income)) as the Company committed to actions in light of slower than expected 2019 sales and associated with realigning its
organizational structure and operating model. See Note 5 for additional details.
●
The year-on-year impact of the non divestiture-related restructuring charges taken in 2020 and 2019 increased operating income margins.
Acquisitions/divestitures:
●
Acquisition-related impacts relate to the ongoing integration of M*Modal and Acelity, which decreased operating income margins year-on-year
.
●
Divestiture impacts, which includes lost operating income from divested businesses, increased operating income margins year-on-year.
Selling price and raw material impact:
●
Higher selling prices in addition to lower raw material cost impacts benefited operating income margins year-on-year for 2020.
Foreign exchange impacts:
●
Foreign currency effects (net of hedge gains) decreased operating income margins year-on-year.
Significant litigation-related charges:
●
Operating income margins for 2020 and 2019 included the $17 million and $762 million impact, respectively, of significant litigation-related
charges (as discussed earlier in the 
Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)
 section).
Gain/loss on sale of businesses:
●
2020 and 2019 included gains of $389 million and $114 million, respectively, on sale of businesses. See the 
Certain amounts adjusted for special
items - (non-GAAP measures)
 section for more information.
Table of Contents
32
Divestiture-related restructuring actions:
●
Operating income margins for full year 2020 included the $55 million second quarter impact as a result of certain restructuring actions following the
divestiture of substantially all of the drug delivery business addressing corporate functional costs and manufacturing footprint across 3M in relation
to the magnitude of amounts previously allocated/burdened to the divested business. Refer to Note 5 for further details. This item was also discussed
earlier in the 
Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)
 section.
Year 2019 operating income:
Operating income margins decreased 2.8 percentage points for the full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018. Factoring out the impact on operating
income of special items as described in the 
Certain amounts adjusted for special items – (non-GAAP measures) 
section above, operating margins decreased
2.3 percentage points to 21.2 percent in 2019 when compared to 2018.
Organic volume/productivity and other:
●
Negative organic local sales volume growth as a result of 
softness in certain end markets and channel inventory adjustments, along with actions
taken by 3M in response to lower sales volumes and high inventory levels, which resulted in lower manufacturing and inventory absorption, reduced
operating margins. P
artially offsetting these impacts were 
benefits from restructuring actions taken in the second quarter of 2019
.
●
Operating income margins increased year-on-year due to lower defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense.
Non divestiture-related restructuring actions:
●
During the second quarter of 2019, in light of slower than expected 2019 sales, and additionally in the fourth quarter to realign 3M’s organizational
structure and operating model, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions. The resulting 
charges included $246
million impacting operating income (and $36 million impacting other expense (income)). See Note 5 for additional details.
Acquisitions/divestitures:
●
Acquisition-related impacts relate to the on-going integration of M*Modal and Acelity, which decreased operating income margins year-on-year.
●
Divestiture impacts include the lost operating income from divested businesses, which increased operating income margins year-on-year and
primarily relate to the divestiture of the Communication Markets Division.
●
Remaining stranded costs from the 2018 divestiture of the Communication Markets Division also reduced operating margins year-on-year.
Selling price and raw material impact:
●
Higher selling prices, partially offset by raw material cost increases, benefited operating income margins year-on-year for 2019.
Foreign exchange impacts:
●
Foreign currency effects (net of hedge gains) increased operating income margins year-on-year.
Significant litigation-related charges
:
●
Operating income margins for 2018 and 2019 included the $897 million and $762 million impact, respectively, of significant litigation-related
charges (as discussed earlier in the 
Certain amounts adjusted special items - (non-GAAP measures)
 section.
Other Expense (Income), Net:
See Note 6 for a detailed breakout of this line item.
The decrease in other expense (income) during 2020 was primarily due to the 2019 impact of deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary.
Refer to Note 1 for additional details.

Interest expense (net of interest income) increased during 2020 and 2019. The increase in 2020 was due to higher U.S. average debt balances and lower
year-on-year interest income driven by lower average interest rates on cash balances. 2020 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment
charge in conjunction with the repayment of notes in December 2020. The increase in 2019 was driven by higher U.S. average debt balances, partially
offset by the year-on-year increase in interest income driven by higher balances in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during the year resulting
from the proceeds from debt issuances in advance of the October 2019 Acelity acquisition.
In addition, other expense (income) was impacted by lower year-on-year pension and postretirement net periodic benefit non-service benefits for 2020 and
2019, respectively. The lower year-on-year benefit in 2020 was primarily due to the increased expense from lower December 31, 2019 discount rates. The
decreases in 2019 was primarily due to the charge associated with the voluntary retirement program taken in the second quarter of 2019 in addition to the
pension settlement charges in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to employee retirements. Refer to Note 13 for additional details.

Overview section above and in Note 10.
3M currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2021 will be approximately 20 to 21 percent.
The tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, and employee share-
based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.

Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M
consolidated entities. The primary noncontrolling interest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M’s effective ownership is 75 percent.
Currency Effects:
3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $81 million in 2020 and increased pre-tax income
by $1 million in 2019. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on
the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to
reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-
tax income by approximately $21 million in 2020 and increased pre-tax income by approximately $201 million in 2019. These estimates include transaction
gains and

losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. Refer to Note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information concerning 3M’s hedging activities.
PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEG
MENT
Item 1, Business Segments, provides an overview of 3M’s business segments. In addition, disclosures relating to 3M’s business segments are provided in
Note 19. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort to improve the alignment of
businesses around markets. Also, effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M’s chief operating
decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) has been updated
for all periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates
resources for the Company’s business segments.
As discussed in Note 19, 3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating
income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in
“Elimination of Dual Credit”). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as
described below in “Corporate and Unallocated”). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and,
instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related
restructuring actions.
Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The
reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.
Corporate and Unallocated:
In addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the preceding
business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and
losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring
charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its
business segments. Additionally, Corporate and Unallocated operating income includes special items such as significant litigation-related charges/benefits,
gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract
manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its 2018 divestiture through
2019 and the acquirer of the former drug delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items,
it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
Corporate and Unallocated net operating loss decreased by $767 million in 2020 when compared to 2019.
Special Items
Refer to the 
Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)
 section and Note 5 for additional details on the impact of significant
litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring actions that are reflected in Corporate and
Unallocated.
Other Corporate Expense - Net
Other corporate operating expenses increased in 2020. The increases were due to year-over-year increased net costs as a result of the regular review of 3M’s
respirator mask liabilities, lower year-on-year gains from certain property sales reflected in Corporate and Unallocated, in addition to transition service and
other arrangement costs, net of income, post-divestiture of the Company’s former drug delivery business in 2020, and increased legal expenses. These
increases were partially offset by lower year-on-year non divestiture-related restructuring costs reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.

PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AR
EA
While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also
utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to
3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different
geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular
geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic
areas is provided in Note 2 and Note 19.

impact of acquisitions (which involved approximately 5,500 positions in 2019), net of divestitures and other actions.
Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment:
Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing
efficiency. In 2020, 63 percent of 3M’s capital spending was within the Americas, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. 3M is
increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic
areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes. Capital spending is
discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA
TES
Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, pension and postretirement obligations, goodwill and certain long-
lived assets, and uncertainty in income tax positions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting
estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.
Legal Proceedings:
Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The
Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and estimable in accordance with Accounting Standard
Codification (ASC) 450, 
Contingencies
. Please refer to the section entitled “Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal
Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in Note 16) for additional information about such estimates.
Pension and Postretirement Obligations:
The Company makes certain estimates and judgements in relation to its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations.
The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the
measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and
discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a
Table of Contents
41
portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits.
Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are
determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-
specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit
obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
Using this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:

Another significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets for the
primary U.S. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected
performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis
for 2021 is 6.50%, a decrease from 6.75% in 2020. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are
calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for
the international pension plans is 4.36% for 2021 compared to 4.70% for 2020. Refer to Note 13 for information on how the 2020 rates were determined.
3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 in determining the fair value of plan assets within the Company’s pension and
postretirement benefit plans. While the Company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and
consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments
could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining
defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of
$456 million and a benefit of $50 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special
termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $406 million, up from $357 million in
2019.
In 2021, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $497 million while non-service pension and
postretirement net benefit costs is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $130 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and
postretirement expense of $367 million, a decrease of approximately $40 million compared to 2020.
The table below summarizes the impact on 2021 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease
in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2020 net periodic benefit cost. The

Goodwill and Certain Long-Lived Assets:
The Company makes certain estimates and judgments in relation to goodwill and certain long-lived assets. Those include considerations made in the
valuation of certain acquired identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in the
recoverability and impairment assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill.
Acquisition of certain identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets
In conjunction with an acquisition of a business, the Company records identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their
respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows,
associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates. The fair value calculated for indefinite-
lived intangible assets such as certain tradenames, in addition to intangible assets that are definite-lived such as patents, customer relationships, tradenames
and other technology-based assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation, due to the significant estimates used in determining
their fair value. As a result, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price
allocation subsequent to the acquisition, not to exceed one year after the acquisition date, until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized.
Assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill
As of December 31, 2020, net property, plant and equipment totaled $9.4 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $5.8 billion, of which $0.7
billion related to indefinite-lived tradenames. In addition, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. Long-lived assets
with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or asset group’s
ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s
carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely
certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are tested for impairment between annual
tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized
when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of
each year, as further discussed below, and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying
amount may be impaired. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill
would be impaired.
Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of
time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and
assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened
or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. Factors which could result in future
impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the
weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results.
As of December 31, 2020, the $0.7 billion of indefinite-lived tradenames primarily relates to Capital Safety (acquired in 2015), whose tradenames ($520
million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 60 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating
the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to
estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated
royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. In the first quarter of 2020, 3M reflected an immaterial
charge related to impairment of certain indefinite-lived assets in 2020. Based on annual impairment testing in the third quarter of 2020, no additional
impairment was indicated.
3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of
each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level
below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units
Table of Contents
43
within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting
units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair
value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the
reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the
price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash
flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the
price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that
may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. Where applicable, 3M uses a weighted-average discounted cash flow
analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other
factors. The weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.
As described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting. For any product changes that resulted
in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units, the
results of which were immaterial. In conjunction with the change in segment reporting, 3M completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment
existed as a result of this new segment structure. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2020 annual impairment test and is in the
context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.
Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2020, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.
 
As of October 1, 2020, 3M had
22 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 93 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of
the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial
Adhesives and Tapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.
3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M’s
businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised
of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them.
3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2021 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.
Uncertainty in Income Tax Positions:
The extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of
jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of
disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The
Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
, a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to
Note 10 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of
some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax
liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If
payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized
in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI
TY
The strength and stability of 3M’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provides financial
flexibility and enables the Company to invest through business cycles. Investing in 3M’s business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on
invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization
capability. Organic investments will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio to
maximize value for shareholders. Given uncertainty arising from COVID-19, the Company suspended repurchases under its board-approved share
repurchase program effective March 2020 with other repurchase activity limited to 3M’s stock compensation plans. 3M will continue to return cash to
shareholders through dividends and plans to resume share repurchases in 2021. 3M maintains strong liquidity and further added to its liquidity position
through the issuance of $1.75 billion in registered notes in March 2020. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow
from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested.
For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for
U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to
the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum
maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2020, there was no commercial paper issued and outstanding.
Total Debt:
The strength of 3M’s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s debt
maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an A1
credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody’s Investors Service and an A+ credit rating with negative outlook from Standard and Poor’s.
The Company’s total debt was $1.5 billion lower at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019. Decreases in debt are further described in
Note 12 and include the repayment of aggregate $445 million principal amount of Third Lien Notes subject to in-substance defeasance, 650 million euros
and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured, the December 2020 repayment of $1 billion aggregate
principal amount of notes related to make-whole-call offers, lower commercial paper balance, and the repayment of the 80 billion Japanese yen and 150
million euro credit facilities. These decreases were partially offset by the March 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion of registered notes. For discussion of
repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” section.
In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London
InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR’s administrator, proposed extending
the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, and derivative instruments and continues
to evaluate commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. 3M will continue its assessment and monitor regulatory developments
during the transition period.
Effective February 10, 2020, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate
amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated February 24, 2017. In May 2016, in
connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time)
of the Company’s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous
aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.
As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019
and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt).
Additionally, the August 2019 and March 2020 debt was issued under the WKSI shelf registration, but not as part of the medium-term notes program
(Series F). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.

The Company has a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in November 2024. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under
which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender’s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $4.0 billion. In addition, 3M entered into a
$1.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which was renewed in November 2020 with an expiration date of November 2021. The 364-day credit agreement
includes a provision under which 3M may convert any advances outstanding on the maturity date into term loans with a maturity date one year later. These
credit facilities were undrawn at December 31, 2020. Under both the $3.0 billion and $1.25 billion credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain
its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of
consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31,
2020, this ratio was approximately 17 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
Apart from the committed credit facilities described above, in September 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility initially expiring in July 2020 that was
further extended to August 2021 in the amount of 80 billion Japanese yen. In November 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility expiring in November 2020
in the amount of 150 million euros. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances and closed these credit facilities. The
Company also had $273 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December 31, 2020. These instruments are
utilized in connection with normal business activities.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:
At December 31, 2020, 3M had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.8 billion was held by the
Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $2.3 billion was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other
high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2019, 3M had $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which
approximately $2.4 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $100 million was held by the United States. The increase
from December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from strong cash flow from operations, reduced capital expenditures, and lower share repurchases. 
Net Debt (non-GAAP measure):
Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines
net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to
investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt
as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Balance Sheet:
3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. The Company
will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.
The Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory
activity.

Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs.
Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by
other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors
as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.
Working capital increased $3.3 billion compared with December 31, 2019. Balance changes in current assets increased working capital by $2.0 billion,
driven by increases in cash and cash equivalents and inventory, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable. Balance changes in current liabilities
increased working capital by $1.3 billion, primarily due to decreases in short-term borrowing and the current portion of long-term debt.
Accounts receivable decreased $86 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to ongoing collection management and increased expected credit losses
on customer receivables related to COVID-19 uncertainty. Inventory increased $105 million from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of foreign
currency impacts. These increases were partially offset by inventory decreases as a result of the divestiture of the drug delivery business.
Return on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a
substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average
invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. The calculation is
provided in the below table.
Table of Contents
47
In 2020, ROIC of 18.2 percent was higher than 2019. The increase was driven by the lower year-over-year impact of significant litigation-related charges in
addition to the non-repeating charge from the 2019 deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuela subsidiary. 2019 ROIC was also negatively impacted by
the increase in cash and cash equivalents in anticipation of the funding of the acquisition of Acelity.

Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items
can significantly impact cash flows.
In 2020, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $1.0 billion compared to the same period last year, with this increase primarily due to cost
saving actions taken in response to COVID-19 and lower year-on-year significant litigation-related charges and the timing of associated payments. The
combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable improved operating cash flow by $326 million in 2020, compared to an operating
cash flow improvement of $598 million in 2019. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and

Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing
efficiency. In 2020, 3M reduced overall spending in light of uncertainty regarding COVID-19, but continued to invest in expanding the Company’s ability
to increase production of respiratory products to meet worldwide demand. The Company expects 2021 capital spending to be approximately $1.8 billion to
$2.0 billion as 3M continues to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability.
3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant
proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.
3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating
pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to
capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as
information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.

Refer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic
alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2020 primarily relate to the payment made for
contingent consideration in regards to the Acelity acquisition. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2020 primarily relate to the sales of the Company’s
advanced ballistic-protection business and its drug delivery business. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2019 primarily include the purchase of
M*Modal and Acelity Inc. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2019 primarily relate to the sale of certain oral care technology comprising a business and
the gas and flame detection business.
Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily
attributable to certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. In 2020 these included
the maturity of the held-to-maturity debt security that was purchased to satisfy the redemption of the Third Lien Notes (which matured in May 2020). Refer
to Note 11 for more details about 3M’s diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance,
plus investments in equity securities.

2020 Debt Activity:
Total debt was approximately $18.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and $20.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Repayment of debt primarily consists of the
aggregate $445 million principal amount of Third Lien Notes and the 650 million euros and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate
medium-term notes that matured in May 2020 and August 2020, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances
on their Japanese yen and euro credit facilities. In addition, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes maturing in September 2021 were repaid in
December 2020 via make-whole-call offers.
 
Increases in debt were related to the March 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion in registered notes. There was no
outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2020, as compared to $150 million at December 31, 2019. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to
repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. 3M’s primary
short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt.
2019 Debt Activity:
Total debt was approximately $5.7 billion higher at December 31, 2019 when compared to December 31, 2018. Increases in debt related to the first quarter
 
and third quarter 2019 issuances of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes and $3.25 billion of other registered notes, respectively, 69 billion Japanese yen
 
(approximately $632 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding from the 80 billion Japanese yen credit facility established in September
 
2019, 150 million euros (approximately $168 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding credit facility established in November 2019, and
 
$0.5 billion of debt assumed and not yet repaid as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Acelity Inc. Repayment of debt primarily consists of the June
 
2019 repayment of $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that had matured, in addition to debt assumed and
 
subsequently repaid as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of M*Modal and Acelity Inc. as discussed in Note 3. Outstanding commercial paper
 
decreased $285 million from December 31, 2018 to  December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt.

Repurchases of Common Stock:
Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In
November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program
authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2020, the Company purchased $0.4
billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $1.4 billion in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $7.8 billion remained available under the
authorization. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company suspended repurchases under its board-approved share repurchase program with other repurchase
activity limited to 3M’s stock compensation plans. The Company plans to resume share purchases in 2021. For more information, refer to the table titled
“Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.
Dividends Paid to Shareholders:
Cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $3.388 billion ($5.88 per share) in 2020, $3.316 billion ($5.76 per share) in 2019, and $3.193 billion ($5.44 per
share) in 2018. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2021, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2021 dividend of $1.48 per share, an
increase of 1 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.92 per share and marked the 63
rd
 consecutive year of dividend increases.
Other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to
or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases.
Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):
Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be
considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used
by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It
should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as
free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as
they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate
cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M’s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and
free cash flow conversion.
Refer to the preceding “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” and “Cash Flows from Investing Activities” sections for discussion of items that impacted
the operating cash flow and purchases of PP&E components of the calculation of free cash flow. Refer to the preceding “Results of Operations” section for
discussion of items that impacted the net income attributable to 3M component of the calculation of free cash flow conversion.

Free cash flow conversion grew to 123% in 2020 compared to 118% in 2019 as increases in free cash flow out-paced increases in net income attributable to
3M.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations:
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section
entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 16 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.
In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major
customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M
personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M’s maximum exposure under these
indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations or financial condition.

As a result of put provisions associated with certain debt instruments, long-term debt payments due in 2021 include floating rate notes totaling $53 million
(classified as current portion of long-term debt).
In conjunction with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has a transition tax liability that is payable over 8 years beginning in 2018. See
Note 10 for additional details.
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company.
Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service
agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with
Table of Contents
52
terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay
contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive
consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but
these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire
anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and
services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s
expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.
Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of
the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months, when applicable. The Company is
not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the
long-term portion of the total net tax liability of $933 million is excluded from the preceding table. In addition, the transition tax prescribed under the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is separately included in the table above. Refer to Note 10 for further details. Additionally, included within the caption entitled
“Unconditional purchase obligations and other” are operating lease commitments that have not yet commenced, which as of December 31, 2020, totaled
approximately $18 million. These commitments pertain to 3M’s right of use buildings.
As discussed in Note 13, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2021 and Company
contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are
not included in the preceding table.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMEN
TS
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies and to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including
certain intercompany financing balances. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing
costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference
between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price
risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.
Refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk,
commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.
Item 7A. 
Quantitative
 and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
In the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest
rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Senior management
provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company’s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides
guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk
analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option
contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through
the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not
anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.
Foreign Exchange Rates Risk:
Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations
in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The
Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the
Table of Contents
53
effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may
dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M
hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency contracts
that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items
including certain intercompany financing balances. As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign
currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company’s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross
notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $2.3
billion at December 31, 2020. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated
as hedging instruments was $3.2 billion at December 31, 2020. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had 3.5 billion Euros in principal
amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 14 in
the “Net Investment Hedges” section.
Interest Rates Risk:
The Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense
using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges.
Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by
reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional
amount of the Company’s interest rate swaps at December 31, 2020 was $403 million. Additional details about 3M’s long-term debt can be found in Note
12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Company’s
long-term debt.
Commodity Prices Risk:
The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. The related mark-to-market gain or
loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which
the hedged transaction affected earnings.
Value At Risk:
The value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Company’s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A
Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to debt instruments, interest rate derivatives and underlying
foreign exchange and commodity exposures outstanding at December 31, 2020. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level
over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used nine currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and
commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model
does not include foreign currency hedges, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The following table
summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.

An analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price change would result
in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $70 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten

percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $40 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs used in
3M production and other facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas.

Management’s Report
 on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Management conducted an
assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of
December 31, 2020, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.

Report
 of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 3M Company
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of 3M Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,
and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated
Framework 
(2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
Table of Contents
56
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Legal Proceedings Contingencies
As described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, management records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can
reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, management
records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. Management either discloses the amount of a
possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Management discloses
significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if management believes there is at
least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to legal proceedings contingencies is a critical audit matter are there
was significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when estimating the loss or range of loss for each
claim, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the
liabilities and disclosures associated with legal proceedings.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the liability related to legal
proceedings, including controls over determining the likelihood of a loss and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial
statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal
counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and
reasonably estimable, and evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s disclosures related to legal proceedings.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1. Significant Accounting Policies
Consolidation:
 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All applicable subsidiaries are
consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless
the context indicates otherwise.
Basis of presentation:
 Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
As described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort to improve the
alignment of businesses around markets and customers. Additionally, the Company consolidated the way it presents geographic area net sales by providing
an aggregate Americas geographic region (combining former United States and Latin America and Canada areas). Also, effective in the second quarter of
2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker changed and, as a result, the Company’s disclosed
measure of segment profit/loss has been updated. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.
Foreign currency translation:
 Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States with the exception of 3M’s
subsidiaries in Argentina, the economy of which was considered highly inflationary beginning in 2018, and accordingly the financial statements of these
subsidiaries are remeasured as if their functional currency is that of their parent. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are
translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in
effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
shareholders’ equity.
3M had a consolidating subsidiary in Venezuela, the financial statements of which were remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent
because Venezuela’s economic environment is considered highly inflationary. The operating income of this subsidiary was immaterial as a percent of 3M’s
consolidated operating income for the periods presented. In light of circumstances, including the country’s unstable environment and heightened unrest
leading to sustained lack of demand, and expectation that these circumstances will continue for the foreseeable future, during May 2019, 3M concluded it
no longer met the criteria of control in order to continue consolidating its Venezuelan operations. As a result, as of
 
May 31, 2019, the Company began
reflecting its interest in the Venezuelan subsidiary as an equity investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value. This resulted in a pre-tax
charge of $
162
 million within other expense (income) in the second quarter of 2019. The charge primarily relates to $
144
 million of foreign currency
translation losses associated with foreign currency movements before Venezuela was accounted for as a highly inflationary economy and pension elements
previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss along with write-down of intercompany receivable and investment balances associated with
this subsidiary. Beginning May 31, 2019, 3M’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations no longer include the Venezuelan entity’s
operations other than an immaterial equity investment and associated loss or income thereon largely only to the extent, if any, that 3M provides support or
materials and receives funding or dividends.
Use of estimates:
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company considered the coronavirus (COVID-
19) related impacts on its estimates, as appropriate, within its consolidated financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future
periods. 3M believes that the accounting estimates are appropriate after giving consideration to the increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and
duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing
from these estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents:
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.
Marketable securities:
 Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost of securities sold use the first in,
first out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the
Table of Contents
63
availability for use in current operations. 3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance
provided by ASC 320, Investments-Debt Securities and ASC 326-30, Available-for-Sale Debt Securities, when determining whether a decline in fair value
below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for
credit losses. The allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. A change in the allowance for credit losses is
recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through
accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders’ equity. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can
include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings
actions, as well as other factors. When a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt
security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. Amounts are reclassified out of
accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to
credit losses.
Investments:
 All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with
changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values
and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balance of these securities is
disclosed in Note 7.
Other assets: 
Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies,
medical equipment in rental arrangements utilized primarily by hospitals and other medical clinics, prepaid pension and postretirement and other long-term
assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash
surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life
insurance activity are included in “Purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and
investments,” respectively.
Inventories:
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
Property, plant and equipment:
 Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from 
ten
 to 
forty years
, with the majority in the range of 
twenty
 to 
forty years
. The
estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from 
three
 to 
fifteen years
, with the majority in the range of 
five
 to 
ten years
. Fully
depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts
until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal,
is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of
an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the
impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted
cash flow analysis. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid
liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.
Conditional asset retirement obligations: 
A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations
exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the
liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related
assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $
145
 million and $
137
 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Goodwill: 
Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is
Table of Contents
64
tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the
business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3M did not
combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting
unit’s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The estimated fair value of a reporting
unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash
flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not “more likely than
not” less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as “Step 0”. 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments.
Intangible assets: 
Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an
independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from 
four
 to 
twenty years
 on a systematic and rational basis
(generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between 
ten
 to
twenty years
, patents largely between 
seven
 to 
twenty years
, other technology-based largely between 
four
 to 
twenty years
, definite lived tradenames largely
between 
six
 and 
twenty years
, and other intangibles largely between 
five
 to 
eight years
. Intangible assets are removed from their respective gross asset and
accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. Refer to Note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and accumulated amortization
of the Company’s intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, within “Research,
development and related expenses.”
Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group)
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or
asset group’s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of
the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually,
and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be
impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.
Restructuring actions:
 Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs,
and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon
distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts
are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees in certain
circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were
communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees’ remaining service periods. Contract termination and other
charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the
counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Asset
impairment charges related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values.
Revenue (sales) recognition:
 The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material
concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3M’s customer arrangements contain a single
performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in
the contracts and, therefore, not distinct.
 
However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-
licensing, multiple performance obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and
non-standard terms and conditions.
The Company recognizes revenue in light of the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers.
Revenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Company’s customer arrangements, control transfers to
customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally
Table of Contents
65
when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfers to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time
as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).
Revenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable
consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates,
trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely
amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes.
The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across
businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives.
There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an
expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal
course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other
excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.
For substantially all arrangements recognized over time, the Company applies the “right to invoice” practical expedient. As a result, 3M recognizes revenue
at the invoice amount when the entity has a right to invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the
Company’s performance completed to date.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using 3M’s best
estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.
The Company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous
periods.
The Company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years
presented. Additionally, the Company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any
year presented.
3M applies ASC 606 utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical expedients:
●
Exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of 
one year
 or less.
●
Practical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would
have been 
one year
 or less.
●
Portfolio approach practical expedient relative to estimation of 
variable
 consideration.
●
“Right to invoice” practical expedient based on 3M’s right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the customer
of 3M’s performance completed to date.
●
Election to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.
●
Sales-based royalty exemption permitting future intellectual property out-licensing royalty payments to be excluded from the otherwise required
remaining 
performance
 obligations disclosure
The Company recognizes revenue from the rental of durable medical devices in accordance with the guidance of ASC 842, 
Leases
. The Company
recognizes rental revenue based on the length of time a device is used by the patient/organization, (i) at the contracted rental rate for contracted customers
and (ii) generally, retail price for non-contracted customers. The leases are short-term in nature, generally providing for daily or monthly pricing, and are all
classified as operating leases.
Accounts receivable and allowances: 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains
allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, and various other items. The allowances for bad debts and cash discounts are based on the best estimate of the
amount of expected credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated cash discounts. The Company determines the allowances based on
historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data, current expectations of future credit losses, and historical cash discounts. The
Company reviews the allowances monthly. The
Table of Contents
66
allowances for bad debts as well as the provision for credit losses, write-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented are not material. The Company
does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. The Company has long-term customer receivables that do not have
significant credit risk, and the origination dates of which are typically not older than 
five years
. These long-term receivables are subject to an allowance
methodology similar to other receivables.
Advertising and merchandising:
 These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $
278
 million in 2020, $
348
 million in 2019 and
$
396
 million in 2018.
Research, development and related expenses:
 These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $
1.878
 billion in 2020, $
1.911
 billion in 2019 and $
1.821
 billion in
2018. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and
improved products and their uses, totaled $
1.146
 billion in 2020, $
1.253
 billion in 2019 and $
1.253
 billion in 2018. Related expenses primarily include
technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of
externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved
investments in R&D-related ventures.
Internal-use software:
 The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use
software. Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of 
three
 to 
seven years
, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational
basis is more representative of the software’s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or finance leases within
property, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and accumulated
depreciation accounts.
Environmental:
 Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are
expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably
estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies.
Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives.
Income taxes:
 The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a
valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company
had valuation allowances of $
135
 million and $
158
 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax
positions based on the rules under ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
.
Earnings per share:
 The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M
common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these
stock-based compensation plans during the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M
common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (
18.1
 million average options for 2020, 
8.9
 million average options for 2019,
and 
2.9
 million average options for 2018). The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31 follow:

Stock-based compensation: 
The Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP). Under applicable
accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over
the period in which the share-based compensation vests. However, with respect to income taxes, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the
award’s intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on the fair value upon vesting of the award (for RSUs), which can be either greater (creating
an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than the deferred tax benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial
statements. These excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash
flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is
subject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and employee stock option exercises.
Comprehensive income:
 Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and
postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging
instruments. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.
Derivatives and hedging activities:
 All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are recorded on the balance sheet at
fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated
with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and
effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in
fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the
same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or
issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.
Credit risk:
 The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and
option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk
through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into
master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow
each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The
Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities
within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may
otherwise qualify for net presentation.
Fair value measurements:
 3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the
Table of Contents
68
amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement
date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of
unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in
valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that
reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best
information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Acquisitions: 
The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
. This standard requires the acquiring
entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date
fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard
prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent
consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting.
 
In addition to business
combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do not otherwise qualify
for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity.
Leases:
 3M determines if an arrangement is a lease upon inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the use of an asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the
economic benefits of the underlying asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used. 3M determines certain service agreements that
contain the right to use an underlying asset are not leases because 3M does not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used. Examples of
such agreements include master supply agreements, product processing agreements, warehouse and distribution services agreements, power purchase
agreements, and transportation purchase agreements.
After adoption of ASU 2016-02 and related standards in 2019, operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date
based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is 3M’s incremental borrowing rate or, if
available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease
term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.
As a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted
annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3M’s leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Certain leases include 
one
 or 
more
 options to renew, with terms that can 
extend
 the 
lease
 
term
 up to 
five years
. 3M includes options to renew the lease as
part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, certain leases contain fair
value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, 3M is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.
For the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3M groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying
asset classes. Variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used
beyond their noncancelable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, and payments for non-components such as sales tax.
Certain 3M leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, 
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
, which revised guidance for the accounting for
credit losses on financial instruments within its scope, and through March 2020 issued ASUs that amended the standard (ASU No. 2018-19, ASU No.
2019-04, ASU No. 2019-05, ASU No. 2019-11, and ASU No. 2020-03). The new standard introduced an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate
credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modified the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. The new approach to
estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain
other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit
exposures. With respect to available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the ASU amended the current other-than-temporary impairment model. For such
securities with unrealized losses, entities still consider if a portion of any impairment is related only to credit losses and therefore recognized as a reduction
in income. However, rather than also reflecting that credit loss amount as a permanent reduction in cost (amortized cost) basis of that AFS debt security, the
ASU requires that credit losses be reflected as an allowance. As a result, under certain circumstances, a recovery in value could result in previous
allowances, or portions thereof, reversing back into income. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2020. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material
impact due to the nature and extent of 3M’s financial instruments in scope for this ASU (primarily accounts receivable) and the historical, current and
expected credit quality of its customers as of the date of adoption.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, 
Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That
Is a Service Contract
, which aligned the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement (i.e.
hosting arrangement) with the guidance on capitalizing costs in ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software. The ASU permitted either a prospective or
retrospective transition approach. For 3M, the ASU was effective as of January 1, 2020, with the Company adopting on a prospective basis. Relevant
capitalizable costs are included in prepaid expenses or other non-current assets, as applicable, prospectively beginning in 2020.
 
Implementation costs
incurred as part of 3M’s cloud-computing service arrangements were not material in 2020.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, 
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). 
This ASU simplifies the accounting for
income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain existing exceptions related to the general approach in ASC 740 relating to franchise taxes,
reducing complexity in the interim-period accounting for year-to-date loss limitations and changes in tax laws, and clarifying the accounting for transactions
outside of business combination that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The transition requirements are primarily prospective and the effective
date for 3M is January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. As 3M does not have material activity associated with items such as franchise taxes or the
types of transactions described above, does not typically have entities subject to relevant loss limitations and is not currently addressing enacted tax law
changes for which this ASU applies, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, 
Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Investments—Equity Securities, Topic 323,
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging
. This ASU clarifies that when accounting for certain equity
securities, a company should consider observable transactions before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method of accounting for the purposes of
applying the measurement alternative. Further, this ASU notes when determining the accounting for certain derivatives, a company should not consider if
the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method or fair value option. The transition requirements are prospective and the effective
date for 3M is January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. As 3M does not currently have a material amount of equity securities and equity method
investments or relevant derivatives, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition,
but will apply such guidance, where applicable, to future circumstances.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial
Reporting 
and in January 2021 issued ASU No. 2021-01, 
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope
. These ASUs provides temporary optional expedients
and exceptions to existing guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to facilitate the market transition from existing reference rates, such as
LIBOR which is being phased out beginning at the end of 2021, to alternate reference rates, such as SOFR. These standards were effective upon issuance
and allowed application to contract changes as early as January 1, 2020. These provisions may impact the Company as contract modifications and other
changes occur during the LIBOR transition period. The Company continues to evaluate the optional relief guidance provided within these ASUs, has
reviewed
Table of Contents
70
its debt securities, bank facilities, and derivative instruments and continues to evaluate commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as the reference rate.
3M will continue its assessment and monitor regulatory developments during the LIBOR transition period.
NOTE 2. Revenue
Contract Balances:
Deferred revenue primarily relates to revenue that is recognized over time for 
one-year
 software license contracts. Refer to Note 7 for deferred revenue
balances at December 31, 2019 and 2020. Approximately $
410
 million of the December 31, 2019 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended
December 31, 2020, while approximately $
600
 million of the December 31, 2018 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31,
2019.
Operating Lease Revenue:
Net sales includes rental revenue from durable medical devices as part of operating lease arrangements (reported within the Medical Solutions Division),
which was $
586
 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Applicable rental revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was not
material.

NOTE 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions:
3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, among other factors, growth markets
and adjacent product lines or technologies. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired
businesses and synergies expected to arise after 3M’s acquisition of these businesses.
Table of Contents
72
2020 acquisitions:
There were 
no
 acquisitions that closed during the year ended December 31, 2020.
2019 acquisitions:
In February 2019, 3M completed the acquisition of the technology business of M*Modal for $
0.7
 billion of cash, net of cash acquired, and assumption of
$
0.3
 billion of M*Modal’s debt. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, M*Modal is a leading healthcare technology provider of cloud-based, conversational
artificial intelligence-powered systems that help physicians efficiently capture and improve the patient narrative. The allocation of purchase consideration
related to M*Modal was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net sales and operating loss (inclusive of transaction and integration costs) of this business
included in 3M’s consolidated results of operations in 2019 were approximately $
300
 million and $
25
 million, respectively. M*Modal is reported within the
Company’s Health Care business.
In October 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the ownership interests of Acelity Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries. Acelity is a leading
global medical technology company focused on advanced wound care and specialty surgical applications marketed under the KCI brand. In the first quarter
of 2020, the Company paid certain considerations previously accrued under the terms of related agreements. Adjustments in 2020 to the purchase price
allocation were approximately $
34
 million and related to identification and valuation of certain acquired assets and liabilities. The change to provisional
amounts did not result in material impacts to results of operations in 2020 or any portion related to earlier quarters in the measurement period. The
allocation of purchase consideration related to Acelity was completed in the third quarter of 2020. Net sales and operating loss (inclusive of transaction and
integration costs) of this business included in 3M’s consolidated results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 were approximately $
350
 million and
$
45
 million, respectively. Acelity is reported within the Company’s Health Care business.
Proforma information related to these acquisitions has not been included as the impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations was not
considered material. The following table shows the impact on the consolidated balance sheet of the purchase price allocations related to the 2019
acquisitions and assigned finite-lived asset weighted average lives.

Purchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisitions which closed in 2019 totaled $
4.081
 billion. The associated finite-lived intangible
assets acquired will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life of 
14 years
 (lives ranging from 
6
 
to 
19 years
).
2018 acquisition:
There were 
no
 acquisitions that closed during 2018.
Divestitures:
3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Company’s portfolio considering, among other items, factors relative to the
extent of strategic and technological alignment and optimization of capital deployment, in addition to considering if selling the businesses results in the
greatest value creation for the Company and for shareholders. As discussed in Note 19 (Business Segments), gains/losses on sale of businesses are reflected
in Corporate and Unallocated.
2020 divestitures:
In January 2020, 3M completed the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business, formerly part of the Transportation and Electronics business, to Avon
Rubber p.l.c for $
86
 million in cash and recognized certain contingent consideration from the outcome of pending tenders. Further contingent consideration
of less than $
25
 million may be recognized depending on outcomes in the future. The business, with annual sales of approximately $
85
 million, consists of
ballistic helmets, body armor, flat armor and related helmet-attachment products serving government and law enforcement. 3M reflected immaterial
impacts in the third quarter of 2019 as a result of measuring this disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and in the
first quarter 2020 related to completion of the divestiture and recognition of contingent consideration.
In May 2020, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its drug delivery business, formerly part of the Health Care business, to an affiliate of Altaris
Capital Partners, LLC for $
617
 million in consideration including $
487
 million of cash, approximately $
70
 million in the form of an interest-bearing
security, and approximately $
60
 million in the form of a 
17
 percent noncontrolling interest in the new company, Kindeva Drug Delivery (Kindeva). Non-
cash consideration was valued at time of initial recognition on an income-based approach using relevant estimated future cash flows and applicable market
interest rates while considering impacts of restrictions related to transferability. The divested business had annual sales of approximately $
380
 million. 3M
retained its transdermal drug delivery components business. 3M reflected a pre-tax gain of $
387
 million as a result of the divestiture. The Company reflects
its ownership interest in Kindeva using the equity method of accounting incorporating the recording of 3M’s share of earnings/losses on a lag-basis based on
availability of Kindeva financial statements. As a result, income/loss from this unconsolidated subsidiary began to be reflected in 3M’s financial statements
in the third quarter of 2020. Kindeva and 3M entered into certain limited-term agreements related to post-divestiture transition and supply services.
In the third quarter of 2020, 3M completed the sale of a small dermatology products business, formerly part of the Health Care business, for immaterial
proceeds that approximated the business’s book value.
2019 divestitures:
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company sold certain oral care technology comprising a business and reflected an earnout on a previous divestiture
resulting in an aggregate immaterial gain.
In August 2019, 3M closed on the sale of its gas and flame detection business, a leader in fixed and portable gas and flame detection, to Teledyne
Technologies Incorporated. 3M’s gas and flame business was part of the overall October 2017 acquisition of underlying legal entities and associated assets
of Scott Safety. This business has annual sales of approximately $
120
 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $
112
 million that was reported
within the Company’s Safety and Industrial business.
2018 divestitures:
In February 2018, 3M closed on the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress monitoring
to TSI, Inc. This business has annual sales of approximately $
15
 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax
Table of Contents
74
gain of less than $
20
 million. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, 3M divested a polymer additives compounding business, formerly part of the
Company’s Health Care business, and reflected a gain on final closing adjustments from a prior divestiture which, in aggregate, were not material. In May
2018, 3M divested an abrasives glass products business, formerly part of the Company’s Safety and Industrial business, with annual sales of approximately
$
10
 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of less than $
15
 million.
In June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division to Corning Incorporated. This business, with annual sales
of approximately $
400
 million, consists of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry including 3M’s
xDSL, FTTx, and structured cabling solutions and, in certain countries, telecommunications system integration services. 3M received cash proceeds of $
772
million and reflected a pre-tax gain of $
494
 million as a result of this divestiture. In December 2018, the Company completed the sale of the remaining
telecommunications system integration services portion of the business based in Germany, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $
15
 million.
Operating income and held for sale amounts
The aggregate operating income of these businesses was approximately $
40
 million, $
40
 million, and $
85
 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
The approximate amounts of major assets and liabilities associated with disposal groups classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2019 included the

based upon relative fair value. The amounts above have not been segregated and are classified within the existing corresponding line items on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

Goodwill
There was 
no
 goodwill recorded from acquisitions during 2020. Goodwill from acquisitions total $

none
 of which was deductible for tax
purposes. The acquisition activity in the following table also includes the net impact of adjustments to the preliminary allocation of purchase price within
the one year measurement-period following prior acquisitions, which decreased goodwill by $
34
 million during 2020. The amounts in the “Translation and

Accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances such as a change in
reporting units or the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division.
As described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting. For any product changes that resulted
in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on
Table of Contents
75
goodwill of the associated reporting units, the results of which were immaterial. In conjunction with the change in segment reporting, 3M completed an
assessment indicating 
no
 goodwill impairment existed as a result of this new segment structure. Goodwill balances reported above reflect these business
segment reporting changes in the earliest period presented. The Company also completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2020
for all reporting units and determined that 
no
 impairment existed. In addition, the Company had 
no
 impairments of goodwill in 2019 or 2018.

NOTE 5. Restructuring Actions
2020 Restructuring Actions:
Operational/Marketing Capability Restructuring:
In late 2020, 3M announced it would undertake certain actions to further enhance its operations and marketing capabilities to take advantage of certain
global market trends while de-prioritizing investments in slower-growth end markets. During the fourth quarter of 2020, management approved and
committed to undertake associated restructuring actions impacting approximately 
2,100
 positions resulting in a pre-tax charge of $
137
 million. 3M is
planning further actions under this initiative primarily in the second half of 2021. This aggregate initiative, spanning 2020 and 2021, is expected to impact
approximately 
2,900
 positions worldwide with an expected pre-tax charge of $
250
 to $
300
 million. The related 2020 restructuring charges were recorded in
the income statement as follows:

Adjustments in the table above reflect changes in estimates from factors such as additional natural attrition and redeployment as COVID-19 delayed the
start of plan execution and update of costs associated with the mix of impacted roles. Remaining activities related to this restructuring are expected to be
completed largely through early 2021.

 per share, respectively.
In connection with 3M’s January 1, 2019 adoption of ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income, and ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, the Company recorded an increase in retained earnings of approximately $

Transfer of Ownership Interest Involving Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries
During 2018, a wholly owned subsidiary in India was sold to 3M India Limited, which is 
75
 percent owned by the Company. Because the Company
retained its controlling interest in the subsidiary involved, the sale resulted in a deemed dividend to 3M, resulting in an increase in 3M Company
shareholders’ equity and a decrease in noncontrolling interest. Refer to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for further details.

The net deferred tax assets are included as components of Other Assets and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 7
“Supplemental Balance Sheet Information” for further details.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for federal (approximately $
108
 million),
state (approximately $
84
 million), and international (approximately $
58
 million), with all amounts before limitation impacts and valuation allowances.
Federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after 
one
 to 
10 years
, the state after 
one
 to 
11 years
, and the international after 
one year
 to an indefinite carryover
period. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has provided $
135
 million of valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets based on
management’s determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be realized.

Effective worldwide tax rate

%
The effective tax rate for 2020 was 
19.6
 percent, compared to 
19.8
 percent in 2019, a decrease of 
0.2
 percentage points, impacted by several factors.
Primary factors that decreased the effective tax rate for 2020 included geographical income mix and adjustments to uncertain tax positions. These decreases
were partially offset by decreased benefit from stock options.
The effective tax rate for 2019 was 
19.8
 percent, compared to 
23.4
 percent in 2018, a decrease of 
3.6
 percentage points, impacted by several factors.
Primary factors that decreased the effective tax rate for 2020 included prior year measurement period adjustments related to 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA), prior year resolution of the NRD lawsuit (as described in Note 16), and geographical income mix. These decreases were partially offset by the
deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary, adjustments to uncertain tax positions, and significant litigation-related charges.
The TCJA was enacted in December 2017, after which the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provided a measurement period of
up to one year from the TCJA’s enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740. In connection with the enactment of the TCJA,
the Company recorded net charges of $
176
 million as measurement period adjustments in 2018, which are comprised of both a transition tax in addition to a
remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and other impacts.
The TCJA’s transition tax is payable over 
eight years
 beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 3M reflected $
584
 million and
$
653
 million, respectively, in long term income taxes payable. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 3M reflected $
69
 million and $
33
million, respectively, payable within one year associated with the transition tax.
The IRS has completed its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2005 through 2016, but the years have not closed as the
Company is in the process of resolving issues identified during those examinations. The Company is under examination or in appeals for 2017 through
2018. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions where the Company is subject to
ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments, which could be impacted by evolving political environments in those jurisdictions. As of
December 31, 2020, no taxing authority proposed significant adjustments to the Company’s tax positions for which the Company is not adequately
reserved.
 
It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. The Company has ongoing
federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax
authorities and not fully sustained. These uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted in light of facts and circumstances
including progression of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the
range by which these potential events could impact 3M’s unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

The Company recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is as follows:

The total amount of UTB, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate by $
1,145
 million as of December 31, 2020, $
1,178
 million as of December 31,
2019, and $
655
 million as of December 31, 2018. The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for deferred items, interest and penalties,
and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the consolidated
statement of income on a gross basis approximately $
21
 million of expense, $
33
 million of expense, and $
12
 million of expense in 2020, 2019, and 2018,
respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At
December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $
126
 million and $
102
million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts are interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is
highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.
As a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain manufacturing activities in the following
countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: China (2022), Switzerland (2023), Singapore
(2025), and Brazil (2029). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $
163
 million (
28
 cents per diluted
share) in 2020, $
127
 million (
22
 cents per diluted share) in 2019, and $
227
 million (
38
 cents per diluted share) in 2018.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has approximately $
15
 billion of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. During the third quarter of
2020, 3M determined that approximately $
5
 billion of these earnings are no longer considered permanently reinvested. The incremental tax cost to
repatriate these earnings to the US is immaterial. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $
10
 billion of undistributed earnings
from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 
31, 2020  which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple avenues by which to repatriate
 
the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that
 
would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.
In March 2020, in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and across the globe, the United States Congress passed the Coronavirus
Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. In December 2020, Congress passed a second relief package, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.
The enactment period impacts to 3M were immaterial to income tax expense.

Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities
In connection with the in-substance debt defeasance of the Third Lien Notes described in Note 12, the Company purchased a $
0.5
 billion U.S. Treasury
security in the fourth quarter of 2019 and transferred it to a trust with irrevocable instructions to use the proceeds from its maturity to satisfy the redemption
of the Third Lien Notes that occurred in May 2020. At December 31, 2019, this debt security was considered held-to-maturity due to the restrictions in
satisfying and discharging the Third Lien Notes, was carried at amortized cost, and was reflected in other current assets on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet. At December 31, 2019, the difference between the amortized cost of the U.S. Treasury security and its fair value was not material. Upon the
maturity of the debt security in May 2020, the Company has 
no
 held-to-maturity debt securities.

NOTE 12. Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings
The following debt tables reflect effective interest rates, which include the impact of interest rate swaps, as of December 31, 2020. If the debt was issued on
a combined basis, the debt has been separated to show the impact of the fixed versus floating effective interest rates. Carrying value includes the impact of
debt issuance costs and fair value hedging activity. For notes subject to in-substance defeasance, the final maturity reflected below is that associated with
the redemption date included in the irrevocable instructions given to the trust. Long-term debt and short-term borrowings as of December 31 consisted of

Future Maturities of Long-term Debt
Maturities of long-term debt in the table below reflect the impact of put provisions associated with certain debt instruments and are net of the unaccreted
debt issue costs such that total maturities equal the carrying value of long-term debt as of December 31, 2020. The maturities of long-term debt for the

Credit Facilities
In November 2019, 3M amended and restated its existing $
3.75
 billion 
five-year
 revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021 to a $
3.0
 billion 
five-year
revolving credit facility expiring in November 2024. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to
$
1.0
 billion (at lender’s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $
4.0
 billion. In addition, 3M entered into a $
1.25
 billion 
364-day
 credit facility, which
was renewed in November 2020 with an expiration date of November 2021. The 
364-day
 credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may
convert any advances outstanding on the maturity date into term loans having a maturity date one year later. These credit facilities were undrawn at
December 31, 2020. Under both the $
3.0
 billion and $
1.25
 billion credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as
of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 
3.0
 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the
four
 consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2020, this ratio was approximately 
17
to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
Other Credit Facilities
Apart from the committed credit facilities described above, in September 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility initially expiring in July 2020 that was
further extended to August 2021 in the amount of 
80
 billion Japanese yen. In November 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility expiring in November 2020
in the amount of 
150
 million euros. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances and closed these credit facilities.

The Company also had an additional $
273
 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December 31, 2020. These
instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.
Long-Term Debt Issuances
The principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table found at the
beginning of this note.
In March 2020, 3M issued $
1.75

In August 2019, 3M issued $
3.25
 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes. These were comprised of $
500
 million of 
3.5

1.75
%, $
750
 million of 
5.5

3.625
%, and $
650
 million of 
30
-year fixed rate notes due 2048 with a coupon rate of 
4.00
%. Upon debt
issuance, the Company entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on $
200
 million aggregate principal amount of the 
3
-year fixed rate notes issued
with an interest rate based on a 
three
-month LIBOR index.
Long-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments
In December 2020, 3M, via make-whole-call offers, repaid $
1
 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $
400
 million
aggregate principal amount of 
3.00
% notes and $
600
 million aggregate principal amount of 
1.625
% notes, both of which were due to mature in 2021. The
Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $
10
 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential
between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.
In May 2020, 3M repaid the aggregate $
445
 million principal amount of Third Lien notes subject to the in-substance defeasance noted below and repaid
650
 million euros aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured. In August 2020, 3M repaid $
500
 million aggregate
principal amount of floating rate medium-term notes that matured.
In June 2019, 3M repaid $
625
 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.
In 2019, 3M also assumed approximately $
2.6
 billion of debt in connection with the acquisitions of Acelity and M*Modal (See Note 3) of which $
2.1
billion was immediately redeemed or paid at close.
In November and August 2018, respectively, 3M repaid 
500
 million euros and $
450
 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate medium-term notes
that matured.

In-Substance Defeasance
In conjunction with the October 2019 acquisition of Acelity (see Note 3), 3M assumed outstanding debt of the business, of which $
445
 million in principal
amount of third lien senior secured notes (Third Lien Notes) maturing in 2021 with a coupon rate of 
12.5
% was not immediately redeemed at closing.
Instead, at closing, 3M satisfied and discharged the Third Lien Notes via an in-substance defeasance, whereby 3M transferred cash equivalents and
marketable securities to a trust with irrevocable instructions to redeem the Third Lien Notes on May 1, 2020. The trust assets were restricted from use in
3M’s operations and were only used for the redemption of the Third Lien Notes that occurred in May 2020. These actions, however, did not represent a
legal defeasance. Therefore, this debt was included in current portion of long-term debt and the related trust assets were included in current assets on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.
Floating Rate Notes
At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging
from 
99
 percent to 
100
 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004, 3M issued a 
forty-year
 $
60
 million
floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index. Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at
100
 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and
2041, holders have put options that commence 
ten years
 from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices
ranging from 
99
 percent to 
100
 percent of par value. For the periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the
aforementioned floating rate notes.
NOTE 13. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In total, 3M has
over 
75
 defined benefit plans in 
28
 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each participant’s years of service,
compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1,
2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while
employed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1, 2016. Most international employees and retirees are covered by
government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is
combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.
The Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained
to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For its U.S.
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an
independent trustee.
The Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to substantially all regular
U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 
5
% of eligible compensation matched in
cash at rates of 
45
% or 
60
%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match
of 
100
% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 
5
% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of
3
% of the participant’s total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees’ elections.
Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were $
201
 million, $
186
 million and $
173
 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 3M
subsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution
plans were $
103
 million, $
96
 million and $
99
 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In May 2019 (as part of the 2019 restructuring actions discussed in Note 5), the Company began offering a voluntary early retirement incentive program to
certain eligible participants of its U.S. pension plans who meet age and years of pension service requirements. The eligible participants who accepted the
offer and retired by July 1, 2019 received an enhanced pension benefit. Pension benefits were enhanced by adding 
one
 additional year of pension service
and 
one
 additional year of age for certain benefit calculations. Approximately 
800
 participants accepted the offer and retired before July 1, 2019. As a
result, the Company incurred a $
35
 million charge related to these special termination benefits in the second quarter of 2019.
Table of Contents
92
In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a non-operating $
32
 million settlement expense in its U.S. non-qualified pension plan. The charge is
related to lump sum payments made to employees at retirement. The settlement expense is an accelerated recognition of past actuarial losses.
In May 2019, 3M modified the 3M Retiree Life Insurance Plan postretirement benefit to close it to new participants effective August 1, 2019 (which results
in employees who retire on or after August 1, 2019 not being eligible to participate in the plan) and reducing the maximum life insurance and death benefit
to $
8,000
 for deaths on or after August 1, 2019. Due to these changes, the plan was re-measured in the second quarter of 2019, resulting in a decrease to the
accumulated projected benefit obligation liability of approximately $
150
 million and a related increase to shareholders’ equity, specifically accumulated
other comprehensive income in addition to an immaterial income statement benefit prospectively.
In the second quarter of 2020, as a result of the divestiture of the drug delivery business, the Company recognized a curtailment in its United Kingdom
Pension Plan. The resulting re-measurement of the pension plan funded status reduced long-term prepaid pension and post retirement assets (located within
“other assets” of the Company’s balance sheet) by approximately $
80
 million, which was 
offset
 within accumulated other comprehensive income (located
within the equity section of the Company’s balance sheet). The expense impact of this re-measurement was immaterial for the second quarter of 2020 and
subsequent periods.
The following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a
summary of the related amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain
non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess benefits for employees impacted by
particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow. The
obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and aggregated less than $
40
 million as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The balance of amounts recognized for international plans in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31 in the preceding table are
presented based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date.
The pension accumulated benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of the
measurement date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans was
$
18.441
 billion and $
17.125
 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation of the international pension plans
was $
8.181
 billion and $
7.355
 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2018, respectively.
The following amounts relate to pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31:

The Company provides eligible retirees in the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings account benefits-based plan. The contributions
provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 
3
 percent per year for employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 
1.5
percent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.
The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement
benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated
liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt
instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company
determined a discount rate of 
2.55
% for the U.S. pension plans and 
2.50
% for the postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2020, which is a decrease
of 
0.70
 percentage points and 
0.77
 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2019. A decrease in the discount rate increases
the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), the significant decrease in the discount rate as of December 31, 2020 resulted in an approximately $
1.8
 billion
higher benefit obligation for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans.
The Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs
are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-
specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit
obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 
6.75
% in 2020. Projected returns are
based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s 2021 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 
6.50
%. The expected return assumption is based on
the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The
2020 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 
22
% global equities, 
12
% private equities, 
49
% fixed-income
securities, and

% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment
management. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2020 was 
13.6
%. In 2019 the plan earned a rate of return of 
16.3
% and in 2018 earned a return
of -
0.5
%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 
10
 and 
25 years
 has been 
8.8
% and 
9.0
%, respectively. Return on assets
assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and
expected long-term rate of return assumptions.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company converted to the “Pri-2012 Aggregate Mortality Table”. In 2020, the Company updated the mortality improvement
scales to the Society of Actuaries Scale MP-2020. The December 31, 2020 update resulted in an immaterial decrease to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S.
accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.
During 2020, the Company contributed $
153
 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $
3
 million to its postretirement plans. During 2019, the
Company contributed $
207
 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $
3
 million to its postretirement plans. In 2021, the Company expects to
contribute an amount in the range of $
100
 million to $
200
 million of cash to its U.S. and international retirement plans. The Company does not have a
required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2021. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and
other factors.

Plan Asset Management
3M’s investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the funds on a going-concern basis. The primary goal of the trust funds is to
meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without
subjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible
within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional contributions from 3M. The
investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S.
pension liabilities.
Normally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. However, due to
external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate amount of 3M securities are not
considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.
The discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 15 for descriptions of these
levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies
or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
In order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include a target
strategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some
investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. Acceptable ranges have
been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will
normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary
of the plans. Approximately 
50
% of the postretirement benefit plan assets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the
primary U.S. pension plan and invested with the same investment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.

Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
Fixed income includes derivative instruments such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and futures contracts. Corporate debt includes bonds and
notes, asset backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and private placements. Swaps and derivative instruments are valued by the custodian
using closing market swap curves and market derived inputs. U.S. government and government agency bonds and notes are valued at the closing price
reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded. Corporate bonds and notes, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted
cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be
observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Private placements are valued by the custodian using recognized pricing services and sources. 
The private equity portfolio is a diversified mix of derivative instruments, growth equity and partnership interests. Growth equity investments are valued at
the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. 
Absolute return consists primarily of partnership interests in hedge funds, hedge fund of funds or other private fund vehicles. Corporate debt instruments are

International Pension Plans Assets
Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. The disclosure below of asset categories is presented in
aggregate for over 
70
 defined benefit plans in 
25
 countries; however, there is significant variation in asset allocation policy from country to country. Local
regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The
Company provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans with more focused guidance to the larger plans.
Each plan has its own strategic asset allocation. The asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced when necessary.

Equities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly traded equities are valued at the
closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
 
Fixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate, (including mortgage backed and other debt) securities. Governments,
corporate bonds and notes and mortgage backed securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently
available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs,
such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.
 
Private equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts).
REITS are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which it is traded.
 
Absolute return consists of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts, derivative instruments, hedge fund of funds, and other
alternative investments. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive
if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks.
 
Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities
purchased and interest payable.
The balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans’ level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute
return asset class. In 2020 the aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains and losses decreased this balance by $
0.5
 million and the change in
currency exchange rates increased balance by $
43.5
 million for a net increase of $
43
 million.  In  2019 the aggregate net purchases and net unrealized gains
 
increased this balance by 
$
24
 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased the balance by $
7
 million for a net increase to this balance of
$
17

NOTE 14. Derivatives
The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate,
interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M,
how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M’s financial position and
performance.
3M adopted ASU No. 2017-12, 
Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities
 as of January 1, 2019. The disclosures contained within this
note have been updated to reflect the new guidance, except for prior period amounts presented, as the disclosure changes were adopted prospectively. For
derivative instruments that are designated in a cash flow or fair value hedging relationship, the impact of this accounting standard was to remove the
requirement to test for ineffectiveness. Prior to the adoption of this ASU, any gain or loss related to hedge ineffectiveness was recognized in current
earnings. For any net investment hedges entered into on or after January 1, 2019, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, including
the time value of the forward contract at the inception of the hedge, are recognized in earnings using an amortization approach over the life of the hedging
instrument on a straight-line basis. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded component and the amount amortized into earnings
during the period is recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income.
Additional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:
●
Impact on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 8.
●
Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 15.
●
Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company’s long-term debt are also described in Note 12.
Types of Derivatives/Hedging Instruments and Inclusion in Income/Other Comprehensive Income:
Cash Flow Hedges:
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other
comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction
Table of Contents
101
affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current
earnings.
Cash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts:
 The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge
against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The
settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during
which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted
transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for dedesignated
hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the
value of derivative instruments after dedesignation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 
36
months
.
Cash Flow Hedging — Interest Rate Contracts:
 The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge
exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.
During 2018, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $
1.2
 billion as hedges
against interest rate volatility associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt. Concurrent with the issuance of the medium-term notes in September
2018, 3M terminated $
500
 million of these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial gain within accumulated other comprehensive
income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $
700
 million of notional amount in
outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps as hedges against interest rate volatility with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt.
During 2019, the Company entered into additional forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $
743
 million. Concurrent with the issuance
of the medium-term notes in February 2019 and the additional issuance of registered notes in August 2019, 3M terminated all outstanding interest rate
swaps related to forecasted issuances of debt. These terminations resulted in a net loss of $
143
 million within accumulated other comprehensive income
that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.
In March 2020, the Company entered into treasury rate lock contracts with a notional amount of $
500
 million that were terminated concurrently with the
March 2020 issuance of registered notes as discussed in Note 12. The termination resulted in an immaterial net loss within accumulated other
comprehensive income that will be amortized for the respective lives of the debt.
The amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income into income.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a balance of $
173
 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging
instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $
107
 million (after-tax loss) related to the forward
starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contacts, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates as of
December 31, 2020, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $
51
 million, $
23
 million, and $
99
 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash
flow hedging losses to earnings in 2021, 2022, and after 2022, respectively, (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).

Fair Value Hedges:
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.
Fair Value Hedging - Interest Rate Swaps:
 The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing
costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference
between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value
hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest
expense.
In November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond due in 2021 for a face amount of 
600
 million euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-to-floating
interest rate swap on a notional amount of 
300
 million euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond obligation.
In June 2014, 3M issued $
950
 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap to convert $
600
 million of a $
625
 million note that was due in 2019, included in this issuance, to an interest rate based on a floating 
three
-month
LIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. This interest rate swap matured in conjunction with
the repayment of the $
625
 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium notes that matured in June 2019.
In August 2015, 3M issued $
1.5
 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into 
two
 interest rate
swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first converted a $
450
 million 
three-year
 fixed rate note
that matured in August 2018 at which time the associated interest rate swap also matured, and
Table of Contents
103
the second converted $
300
 million of a 
five-year
 fixed rate note that matured in August 2020 at which time the associated interest rate swap also matured.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap as a fair value hedge with a notional amount of $
200
 million that converted the
company’s fixed-rate medium-term note that matured in August 2020 at which time the associated interest rate swap also matured.
In September 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $
200
 million that converted a portion of the Company’s $
400
million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 into a floating rate note with an interest rate based on a 
three
-month LIBOR
index as a hedge of its exposure to changes in fair value that are attributable to interest rate risk. The Company terminated this interest rate swap in
conjunction with the early debt repayment in December 2020 of $
400
 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium notes further described in
Note 12.

Net Investment Hedges:
The Company may use non-derivative (foreign currency denominated debt) and derivative (foreign exchange forward contracts) instruments to hedge
portions of the Company’s investment in foreign subsidiaries and manage foreign exchange risk. For instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges
of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates
are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in
earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially
complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is
dedesignated from a net investment hedge relationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes
are recorded in earnings through their maturity date.
3M’s use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by time period
depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are dedesignated, matured, or are newly issued and
designated. Additionally, variation can occur in connection with the extent of the Company’s desired foreign exchange risk coverage.
During the first quarter of 2018, the Company dedesignated 
300
 million euros of foreign currency denominated debt from a former net investment hedge
relationship.
Table of Contents
104
At December 31, 2020, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment hedges was approximately 
50
 million
euros, along with a principal amount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling 
3.5
 billion euros. The maturity dates of
these derivative and nonderivative instruments designated in net investment hedges range from 2021 to 2031.
The location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative and nonderivative
instruments designated as net investment hedges are as follows. There were

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include dedesignated foreign currency forward and option contracts that formerly were designated in
cash flow hedging relationships (as referenced in the Cash Flow Hedges section above). In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency contracts that are not
designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including
certain intercompany financing balances. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value gains and losses on
these contracts are recorded in earnings. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Credit Risk and Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities of Derivative Instruments:
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option
contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through
the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master
netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each
counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. As of
December 31, 2020, 3M has International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with 
17
 applicable banks and financial institutions which
contain netting provisions. In addition to a master agreement with 3M supported by a primary counterparty’s parent guarantee, 3M also has associated
credit support agreements in place with 
16
 of its primary derivative counterparties which, among other things, provide the
Table of Contents
107
circumstances under which either party is required to post eligible collateral (when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds
specified thresholds or if a counterparty’s credit rating has been downgraded to a predetermined rating). The Company does not anticipate nonperformance
by any of these counterparties.
3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when
derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide
information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in
the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the
Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the
transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not eligible for net presentation. As of the applicable dates presented below, no cash
collateral had been received or pledged related to these derivative instruments.

Foreign Currency Effects
3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by approximately $
21
 million in
2020 and increased pre-tax income by approximately $
201
 million in 2019. These estimates include transaction gains and losses, including derivative
instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.

NOTE 15. Fair Value Measurements
3M follows ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
and nonrecurring basis. The Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13, 
Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements, 
as of January 1,
2020. This ASU primarily amended the disclosures around Level 3 investments, of which the Company had an immaterial amount for all periods presented.
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:
For 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities and certain
derivative instruments. Derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and net investment hedges. The information in the following paragraphs
and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with
respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company’s financial statements on a recurring basis for 2020
and 2019.
3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Available-for-sale marketable securities — except certain U.S. municipal securities:
Marketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities.
Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and
other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M
classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2.
Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 11.
Available-for-sale marketable securities —certain U.S. municipal securities only:
3M holds municipal securities with certain cities in the United States as of December 31, 2020. Due to the nature of these securities, the valuation method
utilized includes referencing the carrying value of the corresponding finance lease obligation as adjusted for additional issuances when 3M sells its assets to
the municipality and decreases in the form of bond amortization payments, and as such will be classified as level 3 securities separately.
Investments:
Investments include equity securities that are traded in an active market. Closing stock prices are readily available from active markets and are
representative of fair value. 3M classifies these securities as Level 1. Investments are included within other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet.
Derivative instruments:
The Company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are required to be recorded at fair value. The
Company’s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges
where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M’s net investment are
not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to
changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.
3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps will be
considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange
rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable
market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M’s primary
Table of Contents
109
source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or
counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.
The following tables provide information by level for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

In addition, the plan assets of 3M’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually). Refer to
Note 13.
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis:
Disclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. For 3M, such measurements of fair value primarily to indefinite-lived and long-lived asset impairments,
goodwill impairments, and adjustment in carrying value of equity securities for which the measurement alternative of cost less impairment plus or minus
observable price changes is used. There were 
no
 material long-lived asset impairments for 2018 and 2019. There were no material adjustments to equity
securities using the measurement alternative for 2019. 3M reflected an immaterial charge related to impairment of certain indefinite-lived assets and a net
charge of $
22
 million related to adjustment to the carrying value of equity securities using the measurement alternative during the first quarter of 2020.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, accounts receivable,
certain investments, accounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held-to-maturity debt
securities, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated carrying values because of the short-term
nature of these instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair values as indicated in
the preceding disclosures. To estimate fair values (classified as level 2) for its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes, which are derived
all or in part from model prices, external sources, market prices, or the third-party’s internal records. Information with respect to the carrying amounts and
estimated fair values of these financial instruments follow:

The fair values reflected above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity. The carrying amount of long-term
debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and by the designation of certain
fixed rate Eurobond securities issued by the Company as hedging instruments of the Company’s net investment in its European subsidiaries. A number of
3M’s fixed-rate bonds were trading at a premium at December 31, 2020 and 2019 due to the lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads compared to
issuance levels.

NOTE 16. Commitments and Contingencies
Unconditional Purchase Obligations:
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (non-cancelable, or
cancelable only in certain circumstances). The Company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment (for those contracts with terms in
excess of one year) as of December 31, 2020, at $
985
 million. Payments by year are estimated as follows: 2021 ($
294
 million), 2022 ($
328
 million), 2023
($
216
 million), 2024 ($
95
 million), 2025 ($
46
 million) and after 2026 ($
6
 million). Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M
guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or
services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but
represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no
unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company’s expected future cash outflows related to
purchases.
Warranties/Guarantees:
3M’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at
approximately $
46
 million at December 31, 2020, and $
51
 million at December 31, 2019. Further information on product warranties are not disclosed, as
the Company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans
with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.
Related Party Activity:
3M does not have any material related party activity.
Legal Proceedings
:
The Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings
worldwide. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings include, but are not limited to, products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly
manufactured and sold), intellectual property, commercial, antitrust, federal False Claims Act, securities, and state and federal environmental laws. Unless
otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings. From time to time, the Company also receives subpoenas or
requests for information from various government agencies. The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative, thorough
and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Such subpoenas
and requests can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of administrative, civil or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and
others, as well as to settlements. The outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are often difficult to predict. Any determination that the
Company’s operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil or
criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement, suspension or debarment or injunctive relief.
Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings
Many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and alleged actual damages, all of which are otherwise
subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily
on estimates and assumptions. When making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the
requirements of ASC 450, 
Contingencies
, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the
loss and when liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial
statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a
possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses
significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at
least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
Table of Contents
112
Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the Company may
not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. Many of the matters described are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate
amount of damages. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. A future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or
increase in accruals for one or more of these matters could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded. Although the Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, the
Company currently believes that the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings or future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position of the Company. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and
associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable.
Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the Company
could change in the future.
Process for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings
The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law
interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an
amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial
statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the Company’s insurance program. For those
insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable,
or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to
recover for the expense incurred.
The following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated
insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation
As of December 31, 2020, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to
represent approximately 
2,075
 individual claimants, compared to approximately 
1,727
 individual claimants with actions pending on December 31, 2019.
The vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s mask and
respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal
mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. As of year-end 2020, there has
been an increase in the number of cases filed alleging injuries from exposures to coal mine dust. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and
currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by
the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.
The Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects
that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims
alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than
in the past. Over the past 
twenty
 plus years, the Company has prevailed in 
fifteen
 of the 
sixteen
 cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018
described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in 
two
 lawsuits – 
one
 in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts
state court in December – both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April
2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found 3M’s 8710 respirators failed to protect 
two
 coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory
damages of approximately $
2
 million and punitive damages totaling $
63
 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company
appealed. During March and April 2019, the Company agreed in principle to settle a substantial majority of the coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and
West Virginia for $
340
 million, including the jury verdict in April 2018 in the Kentucky case mentioned above. That settlement was completed in 2019,
and the appeal has been dismissed. In October 2020, 3M defended a respirator case before a jury in King County, Washington, involving a former shipyard
worker who alleged 3M’s 8710
Table of Contents
113
respirator was defective and that 3M acted negligently in failing to protect him against asbestos fibers. The jury delivered a complete defense verdict in
favor of 3M, concluding that the 8710 respirator was not defective in design or warnings and any conduct by 3M was not a cause of plaintiff’s
mesothelioma. The plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal.
The Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended
manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if
significant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company’s litigation experience indicates that claims of
persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of
unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it
experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.
As previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and 
two
 other
manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended
complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker’s
compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. In October 2019, the
court granted the State’s motion to sever its unfair trade practices claim. In January 2020, the manufacturers filed a petition with the West Virginia Supreme
Court, challenging the trial court’s rulings; that petition was denied in November 2020. 
No
 liability has been recorded for this matter because the Company
believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the
lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in this case, and the assertions of claims against
two
 other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury
may allocate to each defendant if the case were ultimately tried.
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables
The Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and historical
claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the
proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other
occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve
pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims, (collectively, the “Claims Data”). As part of its comprehensive legal
review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of Claims Data on future filing trends and
costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The Company uses these estimates to
develop its best estimate of probable liability.
Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes
in (i) the key assumptions underlying the Company’s accrual, including, the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, the average cost of
defending and resolving claims, and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims,
and (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.
As a result of its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, of pending and expected lawsuits and of the cost of resolving claims of persons who
claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the Company increased its accruals in 2020 for respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities by a total of $
120
 million. In 2020, the Company made payments for legal defense costs and settlements of $
66
 million related to
the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $
313
 million in conjunction with an
increase in the accrual as a result of the March and April 2019 settlements-in-principle of the coal mine dust lawsuits mentioned above and the Company’s
assessment of other current and expected coal mine dust lawsuits (including the costs to resolve all current and expected coal mine dust lawsuits in
Kentucky and West Virginia). As of December 31, 2020, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of
$
662
 million. This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed
against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability
may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted
or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages
alleged are
Table of Contents
114
typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by
state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described
above that may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of liabilities.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $
4
 million. The
Company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company
will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.
Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies
On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies (“Aearo”). Aearo
manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection
products.
As of December 31, 2020, Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo’s respirator business (American Optical Corporation,
Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (“Cabot”)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in
numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for
alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by
other defendants or generally in the workplace.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $
28
 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to
 
current and future Aearo-related asbestos,  silica-related and coal mine dust claims. This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of Aearo’s
 
probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against Aearo approaching the year 2050. The accrual was reduced by 
$
37
million during the second quarter of 2020 after paying Aearo’s share of certain settlements under the informal arrangement described below. The accrual
reflects the Company’s assessment of pending and expected lawsuits, its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, and the cost of resolving claims
of persons who claim more serious injuries. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal
arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the “Payor Group”).
Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the “AO Safety” brand and/or owned
the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff.
Aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement
provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $
100,000
, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against,
any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in
determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims
arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in
place, Aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica
products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some
part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no
longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.
Developments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in
the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these
claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure
applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor
Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which
Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of
Aearo’s share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these
liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.
Table of Contents
115
Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future
claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities, the Company
cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.
Environmental Matters and Litigation
The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic
substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private
parties in the United States and abroad. These laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for
capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property
damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations,
defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to
satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates,
policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.
Under certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
(CERCLA) and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of
environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. The Company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in
the United States, at which it may have some liability. Please refer to the section entitled “
Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables” 
that
follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.
Environmental Matters
As previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including
perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), or other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(collectively PFAS). As a result of its phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures certain PFAS compounds including PFOA,
PFOS, PFHxS, and their pre-cursor compounds. The Company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately
two years
 of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. The Company
continues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length PFAS compounds, including, but not limited to, pre-cursor compounds to perfluorobutane
sulfonate (PFBS). These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and
fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification
processes associated with the Company’s policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review,
control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials or as byproducts in some of 3M’s current fluorochemical manufacturing
processes, products, and waste streams.
Regulatory activities concerning PFAS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities
include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. In the European Union, where 3M has
manufacturing facilities in countries such as Germany and Belgium, recent regulatory activities have included preliminary work on various restrictions
under the Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), including the restriction of PFAS in
certain usages and a broader restriction of PFAS as a class. As of December 2020, PFOA is subject to certain restrictions under EU’s Persistent Organic
Pollutants (POPs) Recast Regulation.
In the United States, as the database of studies of both PFOA and PFOS has expanded, the EPA has developed human health effects documents
summarizing the available data from these studies. In February 2014, the EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for
PFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in August 2014. In May 2016, the EPA announced lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS at 
70
parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the provisional levels established by the EPA in 2009 of 
400
 ppt for PFOA and 
200
 ppt for PFOS). Where PFOA and
PFOS are found together, EPA recommends that the concentrations be added together, and the lifetime health advisory for PFOA and PFOS combined is
also 
70
 ppt. Lifetime health advisories, which are non-enforceable and non-regulatory, provide information about concentrations of drinking water
contaminants at
Table of Contents
116
which adverse health effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration. To collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water
Act, the EPA published on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including 
six
 PFAS chemicals, required to be monitored during the period 2013-
2015 by public water system suppliers to determine the extent of their occurrence. Through January 2017, the EPA reported results for 
4,920
 public water
supplies nationwide. Based on the 2016 lifetime health advisory, 
13
 public water supplies exceed the level for PFOA and 
46
 exceed the level for PFOS
(unchanged from the July 2016 EPA summary). A technical advisory issued by EPA in September 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples
stated that 
65
 public water supplies had exceeded the combined level for PFOA and PFOS. These results are based on 
one
 or more samples collected during
the period 2012-2015 and do not necessarily reflect current conditions of these public water supplies. EPA reporting does not identify the sources of the
PFOA and PFOS in the public water supplies.
The Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to remediate historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste
associated with manufacturing operations at its Decatur, Alabama; Cottage Grove, Minnesota; and Cordova, Illinois plants. As previously reported, the
Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) to remediate the
presence of PFAS in the soil and groundwater at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama associated with the historic (1978-1998)
incorporation of wastewater treatment plant sludge. With ADEM’s agreement, 3M substantially completed installation of a multilayer cap on the former
sludge incorporation areas. Further remediation activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies, will be conducted in accordance
with the July 2020 Interim Consent Order described below in the “Other PFAS-related Matters” section.
The Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007
Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFAS in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington
County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the
Company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or
alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (HBV) or Health Risk Limit (HRL) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in
drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS for which a
HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS at these sites that are not controlled
by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During 2008, the MPCA
issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). In
August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company’s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. During the spring
and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 3M commenced the remedial
option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved by the MPCA.
Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode. Remediation work has been
substantially completed at the Cottage Grove site, with operational and maintenance activities ongoing.
In August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in Cordova,
Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results.
In May 2017, the MDH issued new HBVs for PFOA and PFOS. The new HBVs are 
35
 ppt for PFOA and 
27
 ppt for PFOS. In connection with its
announcement the MDH stated that “Drinking water with PFOA and PFOS, even at the levels above the updated values, does not represent an immediate
health risk. These values are designed to reduce long-term health risks across the population and are based on multiple safety factors to protect the most
vulnerable citizens, which makes them overprotective for most of the residents in our state.” In December 2017, the MDH issued a new HBV for
perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) of 
2
 parts per billion (ppb). In February 2018, the MDH published reports finding no unusual rates of certain cancers or
adverse birth outcomes (low birth rates or premature births) among residents of Washington and Dakota Counties in Minnesota. In April 2019, the MDH
issued a new HBV for PFOS of 
15
 ppt and a new HBV for PFHxS of 
47
 ppt.
In May 2018, the EPA announced a four-step PFAS action plan, which includes evaluating the need to set Safe Drinking Water Act maximum contaminant
levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS and beginning the steps necessary to designate PFOA and PFOS as “hazardous substances” under CERCLA. In
November 2018, the EPA asked for public comment on draft toxicity assessments for 
two
 PFAS compounds, including PFBS. In February 2019, the EPA
issued a PFAS Action Plan that outlines short- and long-term actions the EPA is taking to address PFAS – actions that include developing a national
drinking water determination for PFOA and PFOS,
Table of Contents
117
strengthening enforcement authorities and evaluating cleanup approaches, nationwide drinking water monitoring for PFAS, expanding scientific knowledge
for understanding and managing risk from PFAS, and developing consistent risk communication tools for communicating with other agencies and the
public. With respect to groundwater contaminated with PFOA and PFOS, the EPA issued interim recommendations in December 2019, providing guidance
for screening levels and preliminary remediation goals for groundwater that is a current or potential drinking water source, to inform final clean-up levels of
contaminated sites. In February 2020, the EPA provided notice and requested public comment on certain preliminary determinations to regulate PFOA and
PFOS under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). In June 2020, 3M submitted comments on EPA’s preliminary determinations to regulate PFOA and
PFOS under the SDWA.
EPA announced in its Spring 2020 Regulatory Agenda, released in June 2020, that it intended to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to designate
PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA in August 2020. In November 2020, EPA announced it was developing of a new analytical
method to test for PFAS in wastewater and other environmental media. In December 2020, EPA released 
two
 new guidance documents related to PFAS.
First, it issued a Draft Compliance Guide for Imported Articles Containing Surface Coatings Subject to the Long-Chain Perfluoroalkyl Carboxylate and
Perfluoroalkyl Sulfonate Chemical Substances Significant New Use Rule. Second, EPA released for public comment interim guidance on destroying and
disposing of certain PFAS and PFAS-containing materials.
In January 2021, EPA announced its intention to initiate a process to develop a national primary drinking water regulation for PFOA and PFOS; the process
will include further analyses, scientific review and opportunities for public comment. EPA also announced in January 2021 that it will issue an advance
notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to solicit public comment on whether the agency should take additional regulatory steps to address PFAS
contamination, including designating PFOA and PFOS and other PFAS as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and seeking comment on whether PFOA and PFOS and other PFAS should be subject to regulation as
hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA indicated it will also issue an ANPR to collect information regarding
manufacturers of PFAS and the presence and treatment of PFAS in discharges from these facilities.
The U.S.
 
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) within the Department of Health and Human Services released a draft Toxicological
Profile for PFAS for public review and comment in June 2018. In the draft report, ATSDR proposed draft minimal risk levels (MRLs) for PFOS, PFOA
and several other PFAS. An MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of
adverse non-cancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs are not intended to define cleanup or action levels for ATSDR or other
agencies. In August 2018, 3M submitted comments on the ATSDR proposal, noting that there are major shortcomings with the current draft, especially with
the MRLs, and that the ATSDR’s profile must reflect the best science and full weight of evidence known about these chemicals.
Several state legislatures and state agencies have been evaluating or have taken actions related to cleanup standards, groundwater values or drinking water
values for PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS, and 3M has submitted various responsive comments. In September 2019, 3M and several other parties filed a
lawsuit in New Hampshire state court to enjoin PFAS regulations in New Hampshire. In November 2019, the court issued a preliminary injunction
preventing the regulations from being enforced. In April 2020, the New Hampshire Supreme Court agreed to review several issues related to the
preliminary injunctive order. In July 2020, the governor signed a bill passed by the New Hampshire legislature setting the same drinking water standards
that had been enjoined by the court.
Vermont finalized drinking water standards for a combination of PFOA, PFOS and 
three
 other PFAS in March 2020. New Jersey finalized drinking water
standards and designated PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances in June 2020. New York established drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS in
July 2020. Michigan implemented final drinking water standards for certain PFAS, including PFOS and PFOA, in August 2020. Massachusetts published
final regulations establishing a drinking water standard relating to 
six
 combined PFAS in October 2020. Some other states have also been evaluating or
have taken actions relating to PFOA, PFOS and other PFAS in products such as food packaging, carpets and other products.
In October 2020, 3M and several other parties filed notices of appeal in the appellate division of the Superior Court of New Jersey to challenge the validity
of the New Jersey PFOS and PFOA regulations. In January 2021, the appellate division of the court denied the group’s motion to stay the regulations, and
the parties are proceeding to litigation on the merits.

The Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere arising from the foregoing or other proceedings
and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions to the Company.
Litigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Alabama
As previously reported, a former employee filed a putative class action lawsuit against 3M, BFI Waste Management Systems of Alabama, and others in the
Circuit Court of Morgan County, Alabama (the “St. John” case), seeking property damage from exposure to certain perfluorochemicals at or near the
Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility. The parties have agreed to continue to stay the St. John case through February 2021
, 
pending
ongoing mediation between the parties involved in this case and another case discussed below. 
Two
 additional putative class actions filed in the same court
by certain residents in the vicinity of the Decatur plant seeking relief on similar grounds (the Chandler case and the Stover case, respectively) are stayed
pending the resolution of class certification issues in the St. John case.
In October 2015, West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority (Water Authority) filed an individual complaint against 3M Company, Dyneon,
L.L.C, and Daikin America, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The complaint also includes representative plaintiffs who
brought the complaint on behalf of themselves, and a class of all owners and possessors of property who use water provided by the Water Authority and 
five
local water works to which the Water Authority supplies water (collectively, the “Water Utilities”). The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive
damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants’ chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS from their manufacturing processes in
Decatur, have contaminated the water in the Tennessee River at the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment
processes utilized by the Water Authority. In April 2019, 3M and the Water Authority settled the lawsuit for $
35
 million, which will fund a new water
filtration system, with 3M indemnifying the Water Authority from liability resulting from the resolution of the currently pending and future lawsuits against
the Water Authority alleging liability or damages related to 3M PFAS. The putative class claims brought by the representative plaintiffs who were supplied
drinking water by the Water Authority (the “Lindsey” case) remain. The parties are in active discussions regarding a negotiated resolution, and the case is
currently stayed.
In June 2016, the Tennessee Riverkeeper, Inc. (Riverkeeper), a non-profit corporation, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama against 3M; BFI Waste Systems of Alabama; the City of Decatur, Alabama; and the Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur, Morgan County,
Alabama. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in connection with the disposal of certain PFAS
through their ownership and operation of their respective sites. The complaint further alleges such practices may present an imminent and substantial
endangerment to health and/or the environment and that Riverkeeper has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm caused by defendants’ failure
to abate the endangerment unless the court grants the requested relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief. This case has been stayed through
February 2021, pending ongoing mediation between the parties in conjunction with the St. John case.
In August 2016, a group of over 
200
 plaintiffs filed a putative class action against West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority (Water
Authority), 3M, Dyneon, Daikin, BFI, and the City of Decatur in state court in Lawrence County, Alabama (the “Billings” case). Plaintiffs are residents of
Lawrence, Morgan and other counties who are or have been customers of the Water Authority. They contend defendants have released PFAS that
contaminate the Tennessee River and, in turn, their drinking water, causing damage to their health and properties. In January 2017, the court in the St. John
case, discussed above, stayed this litigation pending resolution of the St. John case. Plaintiffs in the Billings case amended their complaint in November
2020 and added 
557
 additional plaintiffs, and in January 2021 amended again to add 
331
 additional plaintiffs.
In January 2017, several hundred plaintiffs sued 3M, Dyneon and Daikin America in Lawrence and Morgan Counties, Alabama (the “Owens” case). The
plaintiffs are owners of property, residents, and holders of property interests who receive their water from the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and
Sewer Authority (Water Authority). They assert common law claims for negligence, nuisance, trespass, wantonness and battery, and they seek injunctive
relief and punitive damages. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in Decatur that have released
and continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in discharges into the Tennessee
River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result of the alleged discharges, the water supplied by the Water Authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated
with PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals at a level dangerous to humans. The court denied a motion by co-defendant Daikin to stay this case pending
resolution of the St. John case, and the case is progressing through discovery.

In November 2017, a putative class action (the “King” case) was filed against 3M, Dyneon, Daikin America and the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water
and Sewer Authority (Water Authority) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The plaintiffs are residents of Lawrence and Morgan
County, Alabama who receive their water from the Water Authority and seek injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, compensatory and punitive damages for their
alleged personal injuries. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in Decatur, Alabama that have
released and continue to release PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in discharges into the
Tennessee River. The plaintiffs contend that, as a result of the alleged discharges, the water supplied by the Water Authority to the plaintiffs was, and is,
contaminated with PFOA, PFOS and related chemicals at a level dangerous to humans. In November 2019, the King plaintiffs amended their complaint to
withdraw all class allegations. Since then, the plaintiffs have added 
37
 new individual plaintiffs and voluntarily dismissed 
five
 plaintiffs (for a total of 
55
plaintiffs). The case is scheduled for trial in June 2022. Discovery in this case is proceeding.
In July 2019, 3M announced that it had initiated an investigation into the possible presence of PFAS in 
three
 closed municipal landfills in Decatur that
accepted waste from 3M’s Decatur plant and other companies in the 1960s through the 1980s. 3M is working with local and state entities as it conducts its
investigation and will report the results and recommended remedial action, if any, to those entities and the public. 3M is also defending or has received
notice of potential lawsuits in state and federal court brought by individual property owners who claim damages related to historical PFAS disposal at
former area landfills near their properties. 3M has resolved for an immaterial amount some of the claims brought by property owners.
In September 2020, the City of Guin Water Works and Sewer Board (Guin WWSB) brought a lawsuit against 3M in Alabama state court, alleging that
PFAS contamination in the Guin water system stems from manufacturing operations at 3M’s Guin facility and disposal activity at a nearby landfill. In this
same month, Guin WWSB dismissed its lawsuit without prejudice and is working with 3M to further investigate the presence of chemicals in the area.
Litigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Minnesota
In July 2016, the City of Lake Elmo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against 3M alleging that the City suffered
damages from drinking water supplies contaminated with PFAS, including costs to construct alternative sources of drinking water. In April 2019, 3M and
the City of Lake Elmo agreed to settle the lawsuit for less than $
5
 million.
State Attorneys General Litigation related to PFAS
Minnesota.
 In December 2010, the State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court against 3M seeking
damages and injunctive relief with respect to the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state of
Minnesota (the “NRD Lawsuit”). In February 2018, 3M and the State of Minnesota reached a resolution of the NRD Lawsuit. Under the terms of the
settlement, 3M agreed to provide an $
850
 million grant to the State for a special “3M Water Quality and Sustainability Fund.” This Fund, which is
administered by the State, will enable projects that support water sustainability in the Twin Cities East Metro region, such as continued delivery of water to
residents and enhancing groundwater recharge to support sustainable growth. Other purposes of the grant include habitat and recreation improvements, such
as fishing piers, trails, and open space preservation. 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $
897
 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in
the first quarter of 2018 associated with the resolution of this matter.
In connection with the above referenced settlement, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the Department of Natural Resources, as co-trustees of the
Fund, released in September 2020 a conceptual drinking water supply plan for the communities in the East Metro area, seeking public comment on 
three
recommended options for utilizing the Fund. In December 2020, 3M submitted preliminary comments on the co-trustees’ draft conceptual drinking water
supply plan to address legal and technical aspects of the draft plan.
New York.
 The State of New York, by its Attorney General, has filed 
four
 lawsuits (in June 2018, February 2019, July 2019, and November 2019) against
3M and other defendants seeking to recover the costs incurred in responding to PFAS contamination allegedly caused by Aqueous Film Forming Foam
(AFFF) manufactured by 3M and others. Each of the 
four
 suits was filed in Albany County Supreme Court before being removed to federal court, and each
has been transferred to the multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding for AFFF cases, which is discussed further below. The state is seeking compensatory
and punitive damages, and injunctive
Table of Contents
120
and equitable relief in the form of a monetary fund for the State’s reasonably expected future damages, and/or requiring defendants to perform investigative
and remedial work.
Ohio
.
 In December 2018, the State of Ohio, by its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in the Common Pleas Court of Lucas County, Ohio against 3M, Tyco
Fire Products LP, Chemguard, Inc., Buckeye Fire Equipment Co., National Foam, Inc., and Angus Fire Armour Corp., seeking injunctive relief and
compensatory and punitive damages for remediation costs and alleged injury to Ohio natural resources from AFFF manufacturers. This case was removed
to federal court and transferred to the MDL.
New Jersey.
 
In March 2019, the New Jersey Attorney General filed 
two
 actions against 3M, DuPont, and Chemours on behalf of the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), the NJDEP’s commissioner, and the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund regarding alleged discharges
at 
two
 DuPont facilities in Pennsville, New Jersey (Salem County) and Parlin, New Jersey (Middlesex County). 3M is included as a defendant in both cases
because it allegedly supplied PFOA to DuPont for use at the facilities at issue. Both cases expressly seek to have the defendants pay all costs necessary to
investigate, remediate, assess, and restore the affected natural resources of New Jersey. DuPont removed these cases to federal court. In August 2019, the
court stayed all proceedings in these actions pending a ruling on NJDEP’s motions to remand the cases to state court. In April 2020, the federal court denied
the state’s motion to remand. In June 2020, the court entered a consent order lifting the stay and consolidating the 
two
 actions, along with 
two
 others
brought by the NJDEP relating to the DuPont facilities, for case management and pretrial purposes. The case is in early stages of litigation.
In May 2019, the New Jersey Attorney General and NJDEP filed a lawsuit against 3M, DuPont, and 
six
 other companies, alleging natural resource damages
from AFFF products and seeking damages, including punitive damages, and associated fees. This case was removed to federal court and transferred to the
AFFF MDL.
New Hampshire.
 In May 2019, the New Hampshire Attorney General filed 
two
 lawsuits alleging contamination of the state’s drinking water supplies and
other natural resources by PFAS chemicals. The first lawsuit was filed against 3M and 
seven
 co-defendants, alleging PFAS contamination resulting from
the use of AFFF products at several sites around the state. This case was removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. The second suit asserts
PFAS contamination from non-AFFF sources and names 3M, DuPont, and Chemours as defendants. In its June 2020 ruling on defendants’ motions to
dismiss, the court dismissed the state’s trespass claim, but allowed several claims to proceed. In October 2020, the state amended its complaint to add a state
commission as plaintiff and make a claim related to the state’s drinking water and groundwater trust fund statute. Defendants have filed motions to dismiss
related to these amendments, and the case remains in early stages of litigation.
Vermont.
 In June 2019, the Vermont Attorney General filed 
two
 lawsuits alleging contamination of the state’s drinking water supplies and other natural
resources by PFAS chemicals. The first lawsuit was filed against 3M and 
ten
 co-defendants, alleging PFAS contamination resulting from the use of AFFF
products at several sites around the state. This case was removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. The second suit asserts PFAS
contamination from non-AFFF sources and names 3M and several entities related to DuPont and Chemours as defendants. This suit is proceeding in state
court. In May 2020, the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss, but dismissed the state’s trespass claim as to property the state does not own. The
parties are now engaged in discovery.
Michigan.
 In January 2020, the Michigan Attorney General filed a lawsuit in state court against 3M, Dyneon, DuPont, Chemours and others seeking
injunctive and equitable relief and damages for alleged injury to Michigan public natural resources and its residents related to PFAS, excluding AFFF. The
defendants filed motions to dismiss, and 3M’s motion was denied in August 2020. Discovery has started in this case. In addition, in August 2020, the
Michigan Attorney General filed 
two
 lawsuits against numerous AFFF manufacturers and distributors, and suppliers of PFAS to AFFF manufacturers. 3M
is named a defendant in 
one
 of the lawsuits, filed in federal court, and the case has been transferred to the AFFF MDL, where it remains in early stages of
litigation.
Guam.
 In September 2019, the Attorney General of Guam filed a lawsuit against 3M and other defendants relating to contamination of the territory’s
drinking water supplies and other natural resources by PFAS, allegedly resulting from the use of AFFF products at several sites around the island. This
lawsuit has been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL.
Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.
 In December 2019, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory,
filed a lawsuit against 3M and other defendants relating to contamination of the territory’s drinking water
Table of Contents
121
supplies and other natural resources by PFAS, allegedly resulting from the use of AFFF products. This lawsuit has been removed to federal court and
transferred to the AFFF MDL.
Mississippi.
 In December 2020, the Mississippi Attorney General filed an AFFF-related PFAS lawsuit against 3M and other defendants directly with the
AFFF MDL court in South Carolina. The lawsuit alleges injuries to the State’s property and natural resources purportedly caused by PFAS contamination
from AFFF use and seeks both compensatory and punitive damages.
In addition to the above state attorneys general actions, the Company is in discussions with several state attorneys general and agencies, responding to
information and other requests relating to PFAS matters and exploring potential resolution of some of the matters raised.
Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Environmental Litigation
3M manufactured and marketed AFFF for use in firefighting at airports and military bases from approximately 1963 to 2002. As of December 31, 2020,
943
 lawsuits (including 
26
 putative class actions) alleging injuries by AFFF use have been filed against 3M (along with other defendants) in various state
and federal courts. As previously noted, some of these cases have been brought by state or territory attorneys general. In most of these cases, plaintiffs
typically allege that certain PFAS used in AFFF contaminated the soil and groundwater where AFFF was used and seek damages for alleged injuries such as
loss of use and enjoyment of properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, remediation costs, personal injury and/or funds for medical
monitoring. 
414
 cases filed since October 2019 have been brought by current or former firefighters who claim to have suffered personal injury as a result of
exposure to AFFF while using the product. The United States, the U.S. Department of Defense and several companies have been sued along with 3M,
including but not limited to Ansul Co. (acquired by Tyco, Inc.), Angus Fire, Buckeye Fire Protection Co., Chemguard, Chemours, DuPont, National Foam,
Inc., and United Technologies Corp.
In December 2018, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) granted motions to transfer and consolidate all AFFF cases pending in federal
courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina to be managed in an MDL proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. Additional
AFFF cases continue to be transferred into the MDL as they are filed or removed to federal court. As of December 31, 2020, there were 
947
 cases in the
MDL, 
933
 of which name 3M as a defendant. The parties in the MDL are currently in the process of conducting discovery.
In June 2019, several subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner, filed 
eight
 AFFF cases against 3M and other
defendants, including DuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that
allegedly have been or will be incurred in investigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF
products containing long-chain PFAS. 
Two
 of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. 
Five
 cases remain
pending in state courts where they are in early stages of litigation, after Valero dismissed its Ohio state court action without prejudice in October 2019. The
parties in the state court cases have agreed to stay all 
five
 cases until March 2021.
Two
 subsidiaries of Husky Energy filed suit in April 2020 against 3M and other AFFF manufacturers in Wisconsin state court relating to alleged PFAS
contamination from AFFF use at Husky facilities in Superior, Wisconsin and Lima, Ohio. The parties have entered into a tolling agreement deferring further
action on the plaintiffs’ claims. The plaintiffs filed a notice of dismissal without prejudice in September 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company is a defendant in 
two
 AFFF-related lawsuits originally filed in state courts (in California and Missouri) that had
been removed to federal court. Plaintiffs in these cases have filed motions seeking remand to state court and opposing transfer to the AFFF MDL. In
addition, the Company is in discussions with several parties that have raised claims related to the use and disposal of AFFF and is exploring a negotiated
resolution with some of them.
.
Other PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation
3M manufactured and sold products containing various PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served
with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M’s customers’ improper
disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to
warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the
Table of Contents
122
product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their
properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-
Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. f/k/a Allied-Signal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., Wolverine World
Wide Inc., Georgia-Pacific LLC, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., Chemours Co., and various carpet manufacturers.
In New York, 3M is defending 
41
 individual cases and 
one
 putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and
four
 additional cases filed in New York state court against 3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. (Saint-Gobain), Honeywell International Inc. and
E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. (DuPont). The plaintiffs allege that 3M manufactured and sold PFOA that was used for manufacturing purposes at Saint-
Gobain’s and Honeywell’s facilities located in the Village of Hoosick Falls and the Town of Hoosick. The plaintiffs claim that the drinking water around
Hoosick Falls became contaminated with unsafe levels of PFOA due to the activities of the defendants and allege that they suffered bodily injury due to the
ingestion and inhalation of PFOA. The 
four
 state court cases also include Tonaga, Inc. (Taconic) as a defendant and make similar allegations related to
Taconic’s facility in neighboring Petersburg. The plaintiffs seek unstated compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’ fees and
costs. 3M has answered the complaints in these cases, which are now proceeding through discovery. The plaintiffs in the putative class action have moved
for class certification. 3M is also defending 
11
 individual cases in New York filed by Nassau County drinking water providers in the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that 3M, DuPont, and additional unnamed defendants are responsible for the
contamination of plaintiffs’ water supply sources with various PFAS compounds. DuPont’s motion to transfer these cases to the AFFF MDL was denied in
March 2020. 3M has filed answers in the 
eight
 cases in which it has been served. Preliminary discovery is ongoing.
In Michigan, 
one
 consolidated putative class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine
World Wide (Wolverine). The action arises from Wolverine’s allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3M Scotchgard, related to
Wolverine’s shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3M’s
product contaminated the environment and drinking water sources after disposal. In January 2021, 3M moved to dismiss certain claims in the complaint,
and the case remains in early stages of litigation. In addition to the consolidated federal court putative class action, as of December 31, 2020, 3M is a
defendant in approximately 
274
 private individual actions in Michigan state court based on similar allegations. These cases are coordinated for pre-trial
purposes. 
Five
 of these cases were selected over time for bellwether trials. In January 2020, the court issued the first round of dispositive motion rulings
related to the first 
two
 bellwether cases, including dismissing the second bellwether case entirely and dismissing certain plaintiffs’ medical monitoring and
risk of future disease claims, and granting summary judgment to the defendants on 
one
 plaintiff’s cholesterol injury claims. The parties settled the first
bellwether case in early 2020. In June 2020, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to reconsider the dismissal of the second bellwether case, and the
plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the state appellate court. In January 2021, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants in 
one
 of
three
 remaining bellwether cases. The remaining 
two
 bellwether trials are tentatively scheduled for October 2021, subject to COVID-19 developments. The
parties have engaged in mediation efforts in both the putative class action and the state court mass action cases.
Wolverine also filed a third-party complaint against 3M in a suit by the State of Michigan and intervenor townships that seeks to compel Wolverine to
investigate and address contamination associated with its historic disposal activity. 3M filed an answer and counterclaims to Wolverine’s third-party
complaint in June 2019. In September and October 2019, the parties (including 3M as third-party defendant) engaged in mediation. In December 2019, the
State of Michigan, the intervening townships, and Wolverine announced that they had tentatively resolved the State and townships’ claims against
Wolverine in exchange for a $
70
 million payment and certain future remediation measures by Wolverine. In February 2020, the court approved a Consent
Decree that memorializes Wolverine’s ongoing remediation obligations and the State’s and intervening townships’ covenants not to bring further lawsuits
as to the remediated area. 3M has been formally designated as a “Contributing Party,” and as such, the State’s and townships’ covenants will also apply to
3M. In February 2020, 3M and Wolverine executed an agreement to resolve the legal claims between the 
two
 companies. Pursuant to the agreement, 3M
made a one-time financial contribution of $
55
 million in March 2020 to support Wolverine’s past and ongoing efforts to address PFAS remediation under
Wolverine’s Consent Decree with the State and the townships. This amount was part of 3M’s charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2019 as discussed below
in the “Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables” section.
3M is also a defendant, together with Georgia-Pacific as co-defendant, in a putative class action in federal court in Michigan brought by residents of
Parchment, who allege that the municipal drinking water is contaminated from waste generated by a paper mill owned by Georgia-Pacific’s corporate
predecessor. The defendants moved to dismiss certain claims in the complaint, and that motion was
Table of Contents
123
denied in January 2021. The parties continue to engage in discovery. As a result of discussions among Georgia-Pacific, 3M and municipalities near
Parchment, Georgia-Pacific and 3M have contributed to a fund of approximately $
5
 million to provide expanded municipal water service in the area. The
municipalities have released 3M from claims relating to or arising out of the extension of municipal water or the alleged PFAS contamination in the area of
that extension. The putative class action claims are not included in this resolution.
In Alabama and Georgia, 3M, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending 
four
 state court cases, including 
three
 brought by municipal water utilities,
relating to 3M’s sale of PFAS-containing products to carpet manufacturers in Georgia. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that the carpet manufacturers
improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa
River, including Rome, Georgia and Centre and Gadsden, Alabama. The 
three
 water utility cases remain in the early stages of litigation. 
One
 state court
case was brought by individuals asserting PFAS contamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on
behalf of a putative class of Rome and Floyd County water subscribers. This case has been removed to federal court, where 3M has filed a motion to
dismiss a series of amended complaints.
In California, 3M and other defendants are defending an action brought in federal court by Golden State Water Company, alleging PFAS contamination of
certain wells located in its water systems. 3M filed a motion to dismiss in November 2020 and in January 2021, the court granted defendants’ motion to
dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. In December 2020, the Orange County Water District and 
ten
 additional local water providers sued 3M,
Decra Roofing and certain DuPont-related entities in California state court, alleging PFAS contamination of the plaintiffs’ water sources and also referring
to 3M's industrial minerals facility in Corona, California as a potential source of contamination.
In Delaware, 3M, together with several co-defendants, is defending 
one
 putative class action brought by individuals alleging PFAS contamination of their
water supply resulting from the operations of local metal plating facilities. Plaintiffs allege that 3M supplied PFAS to the metal plating facilities. DuPont,
Chemours, and the metal platers have also been named as defendants. This case has been removed from state court to federal court, and plaintiffs have
withdrawn its motion to remand to state court and filed an amended complaint. 3M has filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
In New Jersey, 3M is a defendant in an action brought in federal court by Middlesex Water Company, alleging PFAS contamination of its water wells.
3M’s motion to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL was denied. 3M has moved to dismiss the complaint, and the case is currently in discovery. In addition,
3M, together with several co-defendants, is defending 
two
 federal court cases by multiple individuals with private drinking water wells near DuPont and
Solvay facilities that were allegedly supplied with PFAS by 3M. Plaintiffs seek medical monitoring and damages. 3M has filed a motion to dismiss in the
first of those actions and the second is in early stages of litigation. 3M and other defendants are also defending 
three
 federal court cases brought by
individuals who live near the DuPont and Solvay facilities, alleging personal injury caused by PFAS exposure. Those cases are in early stages of litigation.
In September 2020, a federal court case was filed against 3M on behalf of the Borough of Hopatcong, alleging general PFAS contamination of its public
water supply. In December 2020, 3M filed a motion to dismiss the Hopatcong matter.
In October 2018, 3M and other defendants, including DuPont and Chemours, were named in a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio brought by the named plaintiff, a firefighter allegedly exposed to PFAS chemicals through his use of firefighting foam, purporting
to represent a putative class of all U.S. individuals with detectable levels of PFAS in their blood. The plaintiff brings claims for negligence, battery, and
conspiracy and seeks injunctive relief, including an order “establishing an independent panel of scientists” to evaluate PFAS. 3M and other entities jointly
filed a motion to dismiss in February 2019. In September 2019, the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss. In February 2020, the court denied
3M’s motion to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL. In December 2020, the defendants filed their joint opposition to the class certification motion filed
earlier by the plaintiff.
In West Virginia, 3M and other defendants are defending a state court action brought by Weirton Area Water Board that alleges PFAS contamination of
local water supplies. This case has been removed to federal court. The defendants filed various motions to dismiss the complaint based on pleading
deficiencies and lack of personal jurisdiction. In November 2020, the court granted some of the personal jurisdiction motions, denied other personal
jurisdiction motions (including 3M’s) and ordered the remaining parties to engage in discovery on jurisdiction. In December 2020, the court denied the
defendants’ non-jurisdictional motion to dismiss. The case remains in early stages of litigation.

Other PFAS-related Matters
In July 2019, the Company received a written request from the Subcommittee on Environment of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, U.S. House of
Representatives, seeking certain documents and information relating to the Company’s manufacturing and distribution of PFAS products. In September
2019, a 3M representative testified before and responded to questions from the Subcommittee on Environment with respect to PFAS and the Company’s
environmental stewardship initiatives. The Company continues to cooperate with the Subcommittee.
The Company operates under a 2009 consent order issued under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (the “2009 TSCA consent order”) for
the manufacture and use of 
two
 perfluorinated materials (FBSA and FBSEE) at its Decatur, Alabama site that does not permit release of these materials into
“the waters of the United States.” In March 2019, the Company halted the manufacture, processing, and use of these materials at the site upon learning that
these materials may have been released from certain specified processes at the Decatur site into the Tennessee River. In April 2019, the Company
voluntarily disclosed the releases to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management
(ADEM). During June and July 2019, the Company took steps to fully control the aforementioned processes by capturing all wastewater produced by the
processes and by treating all air emissions. These processes have been back on-line and in operation since July 2019. The Company continues to cooperate
with the EPA and ADEM in their investigations and will work with the regulatory authorities to demonstrate compliance with the release restrictions.
 
The Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Decatur plant pursuant to the terms of a Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by ADEM. The NPDES permit requires the Company to report on a monthly and quarterly basis the quality and
quantity of pollutants discharged to the Tennessee River. In June 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the EPA and ADEM that it had included
incorrect values in certain of its monthly and quarterly reports. The Company has submitted the corrected values to both the EPA and ADEM.
 
As part of ongoing work with the EPA and ADEM to address compliance matters at the Decatur facility, the Company discovered it had not fully
characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit. In September 2019, the Company disclosed the matter to the EPA and ADEM and announced that it
had elected to temporarily idle certain other manufacturing processes at 3M Decatur. The Company is reviewing its operations at the plant, has installed
wastewater treatment controls and has restarted idled processes.
As a result of the Company’s discussions with ADEM to address these and other related matters in the state of Alabama, 3M and ADEM have agreed to the
terms of an interim Consent Order in July 2020 to cover all PFAS-related wastewater discharges and air emissions from the Company’s Decatur facility.
Under the interim Consent Order, the Company’s principal obligations include commitments related to (i) future ongoing site operations such as (a)
providing certain notices or reports and performing various analytical and characterization studies and (b) future capital improvements; and (ii) remediation
activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies. Obligations related to ongoing future site operations under the Consent Order will
involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years. The Company does not expect them to have a material impact on its
consolidated results of operations or financial position. With respect to remediation activities, financial obligations related to certain activities under the
Consent Order are probable and estimable, and are included in the Company’s accruals for “other environmental liabilities” as described in the
“Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables” section below. As offsite investigation activities continue, additional remediation amounts may
become probable and estimable in the future.
In December 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama for documents
related to, among other matters, the Company’s compliance with the 2009 TSCA consent order and unpermitted discharges to the Tennessee River. The
Company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents in response to the subpoena.
In addition, as part of its ongoing evaluation of regulatory compliance at its Cordova, Illinois facility, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized
its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cordova facility. In November 2019, the Company disclosed this matter to the EPA, and in January 2020
disclosed this matter to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA). The Company continues to work with the EPA and IEPA to address these
issues from the Cordova facility. In December 2020, the EPA requested certain documents and information related to TSCA compliance at the facility. The
Company is cooperating and producing documents and information in response to the request.

125
The Company is also reviewing operations at its other plants with similar manufacturing processes, such as the plant in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, to ensure
those operations are in compliance with applicable environmental regulatory requirements and Company policies and procedures. As a result of these
reviews, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cottage Grove facility. In March 2020, the
Company disclosed this matter to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and the EPA. In July 2020, the Company received an information
request from MPCA for documents and information related to, among other matters, the Company’s compliance with the Clean Water Act at its Cottage
Grove facility. The Company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents and information in response to the request for information. The
Company continues to work with the MPCA and EPA to address the discharges from the Cottage Grove facility.
Separately, in June 2020, the Company reported to EPA and MPCA that it had not fully complied with elements of the inspection, characterization and
waste stream profile verification process of the Waste and Feedstream Analysis Plan (WAP/FAP) of its Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
permit for its Cottage Grove incinerator. In July 2020, the Company received an information request from MPCA related to the June 2020 disclosure, to
which the Company responded in September 2020. The Company continues to work with the MPCA to address WAP/FAP implementation issues disclosed
in June 2020. In January 2021, the Company received a notice of violation (NOV) from MPCA related to, among other matters, the above-described Clean
Water Act and RCRA issues.  The Company is cooperating with MPCA to address the issues that are the subject of the NOV.
In February 2020, the Company received an information request from EPA for documents and information related to, among other matters, the Company’s
compliance with the Clean Water Act at its facilities that manufacture, process and use PFAS, including the Decatur, Cordova and Cottage Grove
facilities. The Company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents and information in response to the request for information.
The Company will continue to work with relevant federal and state agencies (including EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice, state environmental agencies
and state attorneys general) as it conducts these reviews. The Company cannot predict at this time the outcomes of resolving these compliance matters or
what potential actions may be taken by the regulatory agencies.
Other Environmental Litigation
In July 2018, the Company, along with more than 
120
 other companies, was served with a complaint seeking cost recovery and contribution towards the
cleaning up of approximately 
eight
 miles of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey. The plaintiff, Occidental Chemical Corporation, alleges that it agreed to
design and pay the estimated $
165
 million cost to remove and cap sediment containing 
eight
 chemicals of concern, including PCBs and dioxins. The
complaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the Company. The Company’s involvement in the case relates to its past use of 
two
commercial drum conditioning facilities in New Jersey. Whether, and to what extent, the Company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the
case remains to be determined.
For environmental matters and litigation described above, unless otherwise stated, 
no
 liability has been recorded as the Company believes liability in those
matters is not probable and estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time. The Company’s environmental
liabilities and insurance receivables are described below.
Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables
The Company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters and litigation described above are probable and
estimable based on experience and developments in those matters. During 2020, the Company increased its accrual for PFAS-related other environmental
liabilities by $
96
 million and made related payments of $
125
 million. During the first quarter of 2019, the EPA issued its PFAS Action Plan and the
Company settled the litigation with the Water Authority (both matters are described in more detail above). The Company completed a comprehensive
review with the assistance of environmental consultants and other experts regarding environmental matters and litigation related to historical PFAS
manufacturing operations in Minnesota; Alabama; Gendorf, Germany; and at 
four
 former landfills in Alabama. As a result of these developments and of
that review, the Company increased its accrual for “other environmental liabilities” by $
235
 million pre-tax (including the settlement with the Water
Authority) in the first quarter of 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019, 3M updated its evaluation of certain customer-related litigation based on
continued, productive settlement discussions with multiple parties. As previously disclosed, 3M has been engaged in mediation and resolution negotiations
in multiple cases. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company updated its assessment of environmental matters and litigation related to its
historical PFAS manufacturing operations and expanded
Table of Contents
126
its evaluation of other 3M sites that may have used certain PFAS-containing materials and locations at which they were disposed. As a result of these
actions during the fourth quarter the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $
214
 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had recorded liabilities
of $
416
 million for “other environmental liabilities.” The accruals represent the Company’s best estimate of the probable loss. The Company is not able to
estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had recorded liabilities of $
23
 million for estimated non-PFAS related “environmental remediation” costs to clean
up, treat, or remove hazardous substances at current or former 3M manufacturing or third-party sites. The Company evaluates available facts with respect to
each individual site each quarter and records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable,
generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of
environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number,
participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial
actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the
amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 
20 years
.
It is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of
applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments
may occur that could affect the Company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the
environmental impact of the Company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific
compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and
evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of
other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. For sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental
liabilities,” at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including
required post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the Company’s
consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the Company cannot
estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons described above.
The Company has both pre-1986 general and product liability occurrence coverage and post-1985 occurrence reported product liability and other
environmental coverage for environmental matters and litigation. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to
the environmental matters and litigation was $
8
 million. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this and future expected
increases in the receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future,
(iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, and (iv) the scope of the insurers’ purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage.
Product Liability Litigation
Aearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms – Version 2 earplugs starting in about 2003. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these
earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. In December 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3M in the
San Bernardino Superior Court in California alleging that he sustained personal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3M’s Dual-Ended Combat
Arms earplugs – Version 2. The plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. The plaintiff seeks various
damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company is a named defendant in approximately 
3,130
 lawsuits (including 
14
 putative class actions) in various state and
federal courts that purport to represent approximately 
12,400
 individual claimants making similar allegations. In April 2019, the U.S. Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation granted motions to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Florida to be managed in a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. Discovery is underway. The plaintiffs and 3M
filed preliminary summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense. In July 2020, based on the then current record, the court granted the
plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion and denied the defendants’ summary judgment motion, ruling that plaintiffs’ claims are not barred by the government
contractor defense. The court denied the Company’s request to immediately certify the summary judgment ruling for appeal to the
Table of Contents
127
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In December 2020, the MDL court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate 
three
 plaintiffs for the first
bellwether trial scheduled to begin in March 2021. Individual trials for the next 
two
 bellwether plaintiffs are scheduled to proceed in May and June of 2021.
3M is also defending 
24
 lawsuits brought by non-military plaintiffs in state court in Hennepin County, Minnesota. 3M removed these actions to federal
court and the federal court remanded them to state court in March 2020. The Company has appealed the remand orders to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit. The state court actions will be subject to a bellwether selection process. The first trial in Hennepin County was scheduled for March 2021
but has been delayed.
No
 liability has been recorded for these matters because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at this time.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company was a named defendant in 
23
 lawsuits in the United States involving 
26
 plaintiffs and 
one
 Canadian putative class
action with a single named plaintiff, alleging that the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system caused a surgical site infection.
As previously disclosed, 3M had been a named defendant in lawsuits in federal courts involving over 
5,000
 plaintiffs. The plaintiffs claim they underwent
various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient
warming system. The plaintiffs seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties,
failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various
state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts.
The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of
Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding. In July 2019, the court excluded several of the plaintiffs’ causation experts, and
granted summary judgment for 3M in all cases pending at that time in the MDL. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit. Plaintiffs have also appealed a 2018 jury verdict in favor of 3M in the first bellwether trial in the MDL and appealed the dismissal of another
bellwether case.
Among the 
23
 remaining lawsuits in the United States, 
20
 are in the MDL court and 
three
 are in state court. The MDL court declined to remand 
one
 case to
Oklahoma state court and has stayed all 
20
 remaining lawsuits pending the appeal of the summary judgment decision. In February 2020, the MDL court
remanded 
two
 cases to state court in Jackson County, Missouri that combined Bair Hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. There
is also 
one
 case in Hidalgo County, Texas that combines Bair Hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. In August 2019, the MDL
court enjoined the individual plaintiff from pursuing his claims in Texas state court because he had previously filed and dismissed a claim in the MDL. That
plaintiff has appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Texas state court has stayed the entire case while the appeal is
pending.
As previously disclosed, 3M had been named a defendant in 
61
 cases in Minnesota state court. In January 2018, the Minnesota state court excluded
plaintiffs’ experts and granted 3M’s motion for summary judgment on general causation. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the state court orders in
their entirety and the Minnesota Supreme Court denied plaintiffs’ petition for review and entered the finial dismissal in 2019, effectively ending the
Minnesota state court cases.
 
In June 2016, the Company was served with a putative class action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for all Canadian residents who underwent
various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections that the representative plaintiff claims was due to
the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system. The representative plaintiff seeks relief (including punitive damages) under Canadian law based on
theories similar to those asserted in the MDL.
No
 liability has been recorded for the Bair Hugger™ litigation because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at this
time.
For product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the amount recorded is not material to the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in
excess of the established accruals at this time.

Securities Litigation
In July 2019, Heavy & General Laborers’ Locals 472 & 172 Welfare Fund filed a putative securities class action against 3M Company, its former Chairman
and CEO, current Chairman and CEO, and former CFO in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In August 2019, an individual plaintiff
filed a similar putative securities class action in the same district. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements regarding 3M's
exposure to liability associated with PFAS, and bring claims for damages under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5
against all defendants, and under Section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 against the individual defendants. In October 2019, the court
consolidated the securities class actions and appointed a group of lead plaintiffs.
 
In January 2020, the defendants filed a motion to transfer venue to the U.S.
District Court for the District of Minnesota. In August 2020, the court denied the motion to transfer venue, and in September 2020, the defendants filed a
petition for writ of mandamus to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In November 2020, the federal Court of Appeals granted 3M’s petition for
a writ of mandamus and directed the New Jersey federal court to transfer the action to the Minnesota federal court. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss
the action in January 2021. The suit is in the early stages of litigation.
In October 2019, a follow-on derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against 3M and several of its current and
former executives and directors. In November and December 2019, 
two
 additional derivative lawsuits were filed in a Minnesota state court. The derivative
lawsuits rely on similar factual allegations as the putative securities class action discussed above. The plaintiffs have agreed to stay these cases pending a
ruling on a motion to dismiss the securities class action. In October 2020, the derivative action pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New
Jersey was dismissed, without prejudice, for failure to serve the complaint within the required time period.
In August 2020, an individual shareholder who had previously submitted a books and records demand filed an additional follow-on derivative lawsuit in
the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against 3M and several of its current and former executives and directors. This derivative lawsuit also
relies on similar factual allegations as the putative securities class action discussed above.
Federal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation
In October 2019, 3M acquired Acelity, Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries, including Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and KCI USA, Inc. As previously disclosed in the
SEC filings by the KCI entities, in 2009, Kinetic Concepts, Inc. received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of
Inspector General. In 2011, following the completion of the government’s review and its decision declining to intervene in 
two
 qui tam actions described
further below, the qui tam relator-plaintiffs’ pleadings were unsealed.
The government inquiry followed 
two
 qui tam actions filed in 2008 by 
two
 former employees against Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and KCI USA, Inc.
(collectively, the “KCI defendants”) under seal in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The complaints contain allegations that the
KCI Defendants violated the federal False Claims Act by submitting false or fraudulent claims to federal healthcare programs by billing for V.A.C.
®
Therapy in a manner that was not consistent with the Local Coverage Determinations issued by the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative
Contractors and seek monetary damages. 
One
 complaint (the “Godecke case”) also contains allegations that the KCI Defendants retaliated against the
relator-plaintiff for alleged whistle-blowing behavior.
In October 2016, the KCI Defendants filed counterclaims in the Godecke case, asserting breach of contract and conversion. In August 2017, the relator-
plaintiff’s fraud claim in the Godecke case was dismissed in favor of the KCI defendants. In January 2018, the district court stayed the retaliation claim and
the KCI Defendants' counterclaims pending the relator-plaintiff’s appeal. In September 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and
remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. The district court has ordered a stay of the proceedings pending a further status conference in
March 2021. Separately, in June 2019, following discovery, the district court in the second case (the “Hartpence case”) entered summary judgment in the
KCI Defendants’ favor on all of the relator-plaintiff’s claims. The relator-plaintiff then filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
Oral argument in the Hartpence case was held in July 2020. The appellate court’s opinion remains pending.
For the matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the amount recorded is not material to the Company’s consolidated results
of operations or financial condition.

Compliance Matter
The Company, through its internal processes, discovered certain travel activities and related funding and record keeping issues raising concerns, arising
from marketing efforts by certain business groups based in China. The Company initiated an internal investigation to determine whether the expenditures
may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other potentially applicable anti-corruption laws.
 
The Company has retained outside
counsel and a forensic accounting firm to assist with the investigation. In July 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed this investigation to both the
Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission and is cooperating with both agencies. The Company cannot predict at this time the

Capital and Operating Leases:
Rental expense under operating leases was $
393
 million in 2018.
NOTE 18. Stock-Based Compensation
The 3M 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 
123,965,000
 shares of 3M common stock pursuant to awards granted
under the plan. Awards may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining shares available for
grant under the LTIP Program are 
16
 million and there were approximately 
8,000
 participants with outstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock
units.
The Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the performance of
individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees uses the closing stock price on
the grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-
Table of Contents
131
substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible
to retire at age 
55
 and after having completed 
ten years
 of service. This retiree-eligible population represents 
35
 percent of the annual grant’s stock-based
compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter.
In addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants. The Company
issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the issuance of common stock and
are considered immaterial by the Company.
Amounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, performance shares and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP), are provided in the following table. Capitalized stock-
based compensation amounts were not material.

Stock options generally vest over a period from 
one
 to 
three years
 with the expiration date at 
10 years
 from date of grant. As of December 31, 2020, there
was $
56
 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested stock option based awards. This expense is expected to be
recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 
20 months
. For options outstanding at December 31, 2020, the weighted-average
remaining contractual life was 
63 months
 and the aggregate intrinsic value was $
929
 million. For options exercisable at December 31, 2020, the weighted-
average remaining contractual life was 
51 months
 and the aggregate intrinsic value was $
847
 million.
The total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $
206
 million, $
433
 million and $
469
 million, respectively. Cash
received from options exercised during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $
256
 million, $
375
 million and $
316
 million, respectively. The Company’s actual tax
benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of employee stock options for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $
44
 million, $
91
 million and $
99
million, respectively.
For the primary annual stock option grant, the weighted average fair value at the date of grant was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
and the assumptions that follow.

Expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period. For the 2020 annual grant date, the
Company estimated the expected volatility based upon the following three volatilities of 3M stock: the median of the term of the expected life rolling
volatility; the median of the most recent term of the expected life volatility; and the implied volatility on the grant date. The expected term assumption is
based on the weighted average of historical grants.

As of December 31, 2020, there was $
79
 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock and restricted
stock units. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 
23 months
. The total fair value of restricted
stock and restricted stock units that vested during December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $
91
 million, $
144
 million and $
155
 million, respectively. The
Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units for 2020, 2019 and 2018
was $
26
 million, $
28
 million and $
29
 million, respectively.
Restricted stock units granted generally vest 
three years
 following the grant date assuming continued employment. Dividend equivalents equal to the
dividends payable on the same number of shares of 3M common stock accrue on these restricted stock units during the vesting period, although 
no
dividend equivalents are paid on any of these restricted stock units that are forfeited prior to the vesting date. Dividends are paid out in cash at the vest date
on restricted stock units. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is 
no
 impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average
restricted stock unit shares outstanding are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Performance Shares
Instead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The 2020 performance
criteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested capital, free cash flow conversion, and earnings per share growth) were
selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The number of shares of 3M common stock that
could actually be delivered at the end of the 
three-year
Table of Contents
133
performance period may be anywhere from 
0
% to 
200
% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such
performance period. When granted, these performance shares are awarded at 
100
% of the estimated number of shares at the end of the 
three-year
performance period and are reflected under “Granted” in the table below. Non-substantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be
recognized over 
one
 or 
three years
 depending on when each individual became a 3M executive. The performance share grants accrue dividends; therefore,
the grant date fair value is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic
earnings per share calculations. Weighted average performance shares whose performance period is complete are included in computation of diluted
earnings per share.

General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP):
As of December 31, 2020, shareholders have approved 
60
 million shares for issuance under the Company’s GESPP. Substantially all employees are eligible
to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 
85
% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the
beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.
The weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $
23.47
, $
27.14
 and $
31.91
, respectively. The fair value of GESPP
options was based on the 
15

30

NOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information
3M’s businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M
manages its operations in 
four
 business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M’s 
four
 business
segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient
sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial
intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated
independently, would report the operating income information shown.
Effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed
and, as a result, 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) has been updated for all periods presented. The change
to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company’s business
segments.
Table of Contents
134
3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before
taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in “Elimination of Dual Credit”).
Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in “Corporate
and Unallocated”). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within
Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses (see Note 3), and divestiture-related restructuring
actions (see Note 5).
In addition, effective in the first quarter of 2020, in a continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around customers and markets, the
Company made the following changes:
Continued alignment of customer account activity
●
As part of 3M’s regular customer-focus initiatives, the Company realigned certain customer account activity (“sales district”) to correlate with the
primary divisional product offerings in various countries and reduce complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. This
largely impacted the amount of dual credit certain business segments receive as a result of sales district attribution. 3M business segment reporting
measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment
provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. As a result of this change, previously reported
aggregate business segment net sales and operating income for the total year 2019 decreased 
$
42
 million and 
$
10
 million, respectively, 
offset
 by
corresponding 
decreases
 in the “Elimination of Dual Credit” net sales and operating income amounts.
Additional actions impacting product line alignments
●
The remaining retail auto care product lines formerly in the Automotive Aftermarket Division (within the Safety and Industrial business segment),
were realigned to the Construction and Home Improvement Division (within the Consumer business segment). This change resulted in a decrease of
previously reported net sales and operating income for total year 2019 of 
$
35
 million and 
$
11
 million, respectively, in the Safety and Industrial
business segment, 
offset
 by a corresponding 
increase
 in net sales and operating income within the Consumer business segment.
●
In addition, certain product lines were realigned within business segments. The transdermal drug delivery components business, formerly included
in the Drug Delivery Systems Division, was realigned to the Medical Solutions Division (both of which are within the Health Care business
segment) and the paint protection film business, formerly included in the Automotive and Aerospace Division, was realigned to the Commercial
Solutions Division (both of which are within the Transportation and Electronics business segment).
The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.

Assets subject to attribution to business segments largely include accounts receivable; inventories; property, plant and equipment; goodwill; intangible
assets; and certain limited other assets. All other items are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. Accounts receivable and inventory are attributed based
on underlying sales or activity. Property, plant and equipment are attributed to a particular business segment based on that item’s primary user while certain
items such as corporate-shared headquarters/administrative centers, laboratories, distribution centers and enterprise software systems are reflected in
Corporate and Unallocated. Intangible assets and goodwill are largely directly associated with a particular reporting unit and attributed on that basis.
Business segment depreciation reflected above is based on the underlying usage of assets (while the particular asset itself may be entirely reflected within a
different business segment’s asset balance as its primary user). This depreciation also includes allocated depreciation associated with a number of the assets
reflected in Corporate and Unallocated as described above.
During 2020, information relative to business segment depreciation and assets reviewed by 3M’s CODM changed. The change did not impact each
segment’s operating income, but did change the separate summarization of depreciation by segment in CODM information. Depreciation previously was
summarized based generally on depreciation of a particular asset being associated entirely
Table of Contents
137
with a single reporting unit, as opposed to an estimate of underlying asset usage. New CODM reporting of depreciation is as described above. With respect
to assets in CODM reporting, previously certain assets used by multiple segments were “split” in terms of determining the balances associated with each
business segment (new reporting aligns the entire asset to a single primary user), certain shared manufacturing assets were retained in Corporate and
Unallocated, and a number of other assets were allocated to the business segments. The impact of these changes has been reflected in the above table for all
periods presented.
Corporate and Unallocated
Corporate and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative
gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain
under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments and
is disclosed as ‘other corporate expense-net”. Additionally, Corporate and Unallocated includes special items such as significant litigation-related
charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses (see Note 3), and divestiture-related restructuring costs (see Note 5). Corporate and Unallocated also
includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of all of the Communication
Markets Division following its 2018 divestiture through 2019 and the acquirer of the former drug delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Because
this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
Elimination of Dual Credit
3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. Management evaluates
each of its 
four
 business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth.
As a result, 3M reflects additional (“dual”) credit to another business segment when the customer account activity (“sales district”) with respect to the
particular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division
level. For example, privacy screen protection products are primarily sold by the Display Materials and Systems Division within the Transportation and
Electronics business segment; however, certain sales districts within the Consumer business segment provide the customer account activity for sales of the
product to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Consumer) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated
through its sales district and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from
operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a
reconciling item entitled “Elimination of Dual Credit,” such that sales and operating income in total are unchanged.
Geographic Information
Geographic area information is used by the Company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. Export sales and certain income and
expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. Refer to Note 2 for geographic net sales.

Gross profit is calculated as net sales minus cost of sales.
In the first quarter of 2020, 3M recorded a net pre-tax charge of $
17
 million ($
13
 million after tax) related to PFAS (certain perfluorinated compounds)
matters. The charge was more than offset by a reduction in tax expense of $
52
 million related to resolution of tax treatment with authorities regarding the
previously disclosed 2018 agreement reached with the State of Minnesota that resolved the Natural Resources Damages (NRD) lawsuit. These items, in
aggregate, resulted in a $
39
 million after tax benefit, or $
0.07
 per diluted share. Also, in the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an aggregate
after tax gain on sale of businesses of $
303
 million, or $
0.52
 per diluted share in addition to divestiture-related restructuring charges of $
46
 million, or
$
0.08
 per diluted share.
In 2019, the Company recorded significant litigation-related charges related to PFAS matters and coal mine dust respirator mask lawsuits as further
described in Note 16, which reduced net income by $
590
 million, or $
1.01
 per diluted share, of which $
424
 million, or $
0.72
 per diluted share occurred in
the first quarter and $
166
 million, or $
0.29
 per diluted share occurred in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in 2019, the Company recorded an aggregate after
tax gain on sale of businesses of $
129
 million, or $
0.22
 per diluted share. In the second quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a non-operating charge
related to the deconsolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiary, which reduced net income by $
162
 million, or $
0.28
 per diluted share.

Item 9A. 
Controls
 and Procedures.
a. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
b. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in
the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.
c. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently completed fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
The Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain
financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The implementation of a
worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.
The Company completed implementation with respect to various processes/sub-processes in certain subsidiaries/locations, including aspects relative to the
United States, and will continue to roll out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement,
this application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for
effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of its evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the
implementation of the ERP system in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting.

Disclosure Under Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012
The Company is making the following disclosure under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act:
Protection of Intellectual Property Rights in Iran Pursuant to Specific License
 
As part of its intellectual property (“IP”) protection efforts, 3M has obtained and maintains patents and trademarks in Iran. Periodically, 3M pays renewal

trademarks and has sought to prosecute and defend such trademarks. On January 15, 2020, OFAC granted 3M a specific license to make payments to IIPO
at its account in Bank Melli, which was designated on November 5, 2018 by OFAC under its counter terrorism authority pursuant to Executive Order
13224. As authorized by OFAC’s specific license, in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, 3M paid $522 to IIPO as part of its intellectual property
protection efforts in Iran. 3M plans to continue these activities, as authorized under the specific license.

ARTICLE I.
 AWARD; VESTING; FORFEITURE AND SETTLEMENT
1.1
        
Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents
.
(a)
          
This Award is expressed in terms of a Target Number of Performance Shares as set forth above
(the 
“
Target Number of Performance Shares
”
).  The actual number of Performance Shares that may be earned will
 
depend on Participant
’
s continued service with the Company or any Subsidiary and the extent to which the performance
 
goals established for the Award are achieved.  Each Performance Share earned represents the right to receive one Share
 
on the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth in this Agreement.  Participant will have no right to the distribution
 
of any Shares until the time (if ever) the Performance Shares have vested.
(b)
          
The Company hereby grants to Participant, with respect to each Performance Share, a Dividend
 
Equivalent for ordinary cash dividends paid to substantially all holders of outstanding Shares with a record date after the
 
Grant Date and prior to the date the applicable Performance Share is settled, forfeited or otherwise expires.  Each
 
Dividend Equivalent entitles Participant to receive the equivalent value of any such ordinary cash dividends paid on a
 
single Share.  The Company will establish a separate Dividend Equivalent bookkeeping account (a 
“
Dividend
Equivalent Account
”
) for each Dividend Equivalent and credit the Dividend Equivalent Account (without interest) on
the applicable dividend payment date with the amount of any such cash paid.
1.2
        
Vesting; Forfeiture
(a)
     
.
(a)
          
The Performance Shares will vest according to the vesting schedule set forth in the Vesting
Appendix (the 
“
Vesting Schedule
”
).  Except as otherwise provided by the Administrator (or its delegate) or as provided
 
for in the Plan or this Agreement with respect to Participant
’
s Termination of Service prior to the last day of the
Performance Period by reason of Participant
’
s [Retirement, ]death or Disability, the Performance Shares will
immediately and automatically be cancelled and forfeited as to any portion that is not vested as of Participant
’
s
 
Termination of Service to the extent such Termination of Service occurs prior to the last day of the Performance Period.
  
For the avoidance of doubt, [except as set forth in Sections 1.3 and 1.5 of this Agreement or as provided by the Company
 
under a formal, written severance plan or agreement,] if Participant's Termination of Service occurs prior to the last day
 
of the Performance Period, Participant will not earn or be entitled to any pro-rated vesting for any portion of time before
 
the end of the Performance Period during which Participant was providing services, nor will Participant be entitled to any
 
compensation for lost vesting.  In addition, the Performance Shares will immediately and automatically be cancelled and
 
forfeited (including any portion that is then vested) upon the execution of a written determination by the Administrator or
 
an authorized representative of the Company that Participant engaged in an act of Misconduct (whether the execution of
 
such written determination occurs before or after Participant
’
s Termination of Service).
(b)
          
Dividend Equivalents (including any Dividend Equivalent Account balance) will vest or be
forfeited, as applicable, upon the vesting or forfeiture of the Performance Share with respect to which the Dividend
Equivalent (including the Dividend Equivalent Account) relates.
1.3
         
[Special Vesting Provisions
.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 1.2 or the Vesting
 
Schedule, the Performance Shares shall continue to vest, or vest on an accelerated basis, in the event of Participant
’
s
Termination of Service prior to the last day of the Performance Period under the following circumstances:
3
(a)
          
[If Participant
’
s Termination of Service occurs prior to the last day of the Performance Period
by reason of Participant
’
s Retirement, the Performance Shares shall remain eligible to vest in accordance with the
Vesting Schedule as if Participant had not incurred a Termination of Service, subject to accelerated vesting pursuant to
clause (c) of this Section 1.3; provided, however, that the Target Number of Performance Shares shall be adjusted,
effective as of Participant
’
s Termination of Service, as follows:
(i)
           
If Participant was appointed to the Executive Conference on or after January 1, 2006
and on or before December 31, 2017, the Target Number of Performance Shares shall be adjusted to equal the product of
(A)
 
the Target Number of Performance Shares, as in effect immediately prior to Participant
’
s Termination of Service, and
(B)
 
a fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of whole calendar months Participant provided services to the
Company or any Subsidiary during the Performance Period and the denominator of which equals the total number of
months in the Performance Period; or
(ii)
         
If Participant was appointed to the Executive Conference before January 1, 2006 or after
December 31, 2017, the Target Number of Performance Shares shall be adjusted to equal the product of (A) the Target
Number of Performance Shares, as in effect immediately prior to Participant
’
s Termination of Service, and (B) a fraction,
the numerator of which equals the number of consecutive three-month periods Participant provided services to the
Company or any Subsidiary during the first twelve months of the Performance Period and the denominator of which
equals four.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal
judgment and/or legal development in Participant
’
s jurisdiction that likely would result in the favorable Retirement
treatment that otherwise would apply to the Performance Shares pursuant to this Section 1.3(a) being deemed unlawful
and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply this favorable Retirement treatment at the time of Participant
’
s
Termination of Service and the Performance Shares will be treated as they would under the rules that otherwise would
have applied if Participant
’
s Termination of Service did not qualify as a Retirement.]
(b)
          
If Participant
’
s Termination of Service occurs by reason of Disability prior to the last day of the
Performance Period, the Performance Shares shall remain eligible to vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule as if
Participant had not incurred a Termination of Service, subject to accelerated vesting pursuant to clause (c) of this
Section
 
1.3.
(c)
          
If Participant
’
s Termination of Service occurs by reason of death or Participant dies following
the date of Participant
’
s Termination of Service by reason of [Retirement or] Disability[, in each case] prior to the last
day of the Performance Period, Participant shall vest in a number of Performance Shares equal to the lesser of (i) the
Target Number of Performance Shares, or (ii) such other number of Performance Shares determined by the
Administrator, in its discretion.
For purposes of this Article I, the term 
“
Disability
”
 shall have the meaning given to such term in Treasury
Regulation section 1.409A-3(i)(4).]
1.4
        
Settlement
.
(a)
          
Except as provided in Section 1.4(c), all of Participant
’
s Performance Shares which are then
vested will be paid in Shares, and any related Dividend Equivalents (including any
4
Dividend Equivalent Account balance) will be paid in cash, in each case, during the thirty (30)-day period beginning
with the earliest to occur of the following events:
(i)
           
the Certification Date (as defined in the Vesting Appendix) (provided that in no event
will Shares be issued in settlement of Participant
’
s Performance Shares pursuant to this clause (i) later than March 15 of
the calendar year immediately following the completion of the Performance Period);
(ii)
         
the date of Participant
’
s death; or
(iii)
        
the date of Participant
’
s Termination of Service following a Change in Control of the
Company [(provided that, if Participant is or will be eligible for Retirement at any time during the Performance Period,
such Termination of Service must constitute a 
“
separation from service
”
 from the Company (within the meaning of
 
Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h))].  Notwithstanding anything to the
 
contrary in this Agreement or the Plan, no Performance Shares or Dividend Equivalents shall be distributed to Participant
 
pursuant to this Section 1.4(a)(iii) during the six-month period following Participant
’
s separation from service if the
 
Company determines that distributing such Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents at the time or times indicated
 
in this Agreement would be a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code.  If the distribution of
 
any of Participant
’
s Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then
such Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents (including any Dividend Equivalent Account balance) shall be paid
to Participant during the thirty (30)-day period beginning on the first business day following the end of such six-month
period (or such earlier date upon which such Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents can be distributed under
Section 409A without resulting in a prohibited distribution, including as a result of Participant
’
s death).
(b)
          
[Reserved.]
(c)
          
If permitted by the Company and provided Participant makes a valid deferral election within the
time period specified by the Company in the deferral election form, then Participant may elect to change the timing of
receipt of the Shares otherwise distributable under Section 1.4(a). Any such deferral election must comply with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations or other guidance issued thereunder
as well as any Plan rules on deferrals and must be made on a form approved by the Company. To the extent made, any
such deferral election will be incorporated herein by this reference.
(d)
          
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, the time of
distribution of the Performance Shares and the Dividend Equivalents under this Agreement may not be changed except
as may be permitted by the Administrator in accordance with Section 409A and the applicable Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.
1.5
         
[Effect of Change in Control
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Vesting Schedule or
Sections 1.2 and 1.3, in the event of Participant
’
s Termination of Service prior to the last day of the Performance Period
(i) by the Company or any Subsidiary other than as a result of Participant
’
s Misconduct or (ii) by Participant for Good
Reason, in either case, within eighteen (18) months following a Change in Control of the Company, Participant shall vest
in a number of Performance Shares equal to the sum of:
5
(a)
          
With respect to any calendar year(s) during the Performance Period that have ended prior to the
date of such Termination of Service, the Vesting Eligible Shares for such calendar year(s) as determined pursuant to the
Vesting Schedule; plus
(b)
          
With respect to any calendar year(s) during the Performance Period that have not ended prior to
the date of such Termination of Service, the greatest of (i) the Performance Shares that would have been Vesting Eligible
Shares for such calendar year(s) if the Company
’
s performance relative to the performance objectives for such calendar
year(s) equaled its actual performance during those calendar quarters completed during the calendar year in which such
Participant
’
s Termination of Service occurs and prior to the date of such Termination of Service as set forth in the
Vesting Schedule, (ii) the Performance Shares that would have been Vesting Eligible Shares for such calendar year(s) if
the Company
’
s performance relative to the performance objectives for such calendar year(s) equaled its actual
performance for the three consecutive calendar year period ending immediately prior to the calendar year in which the
Termination of Service occurs, or (iii) such other number of Performance Shares determined by the Administrator, in its
discretion;
provided, however, that the resulting number of Performance Shares under this Section 1.5 shall be prorated to reflect the
number of full calendar months during the Performance Period that elapsed prior to the date of Participant
’
s Termination
of Service.
For purposes of this Section 1.5, 
“
Good Reason
”
 means (i) a material diminution in Participant
’
s position,
authority, duties or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company, (ii) a
material diminution in Participant
’
s base salary or annual planned cash compensation, or (iii) a material change in the
geographic location at which Participant is required to perform services for the Company or its Subsidiaries.]
ARTICLE II.
TAXATION AND TAX WITHHOLDING
2.1
        
Responsibility for Taxes
.
(a)
          
Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different,
Participant
’
s employer (the 
“
Employer
”
), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe
benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to Participant
’
s participation in the Plan and legally
applicable to Participant or deemed by the Company or the Employer in its discretion to be an appropriate charge to
Participant even if legally applicable to the Company or the Employer (
“
Tax-Related Items
”
) is and remains
Participant
’
s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.
  
Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings
 
regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Shares, including, but
 
not limited to, the grant or vesting of the Performance Shares or any related Dividend Equivalents, the subsequent sale of
 
Shares acquired upon vesting, and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to
 
structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Performance Shares to reduce or eliminate Participant
’
s liability for
 
Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if Participant is subject to Tax-Related Items in more
 
than one jurisdiction, Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as
 
applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
6
(b)
          
Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant agrees to assist
 
the Company and/or the Employer in satisfying any applicable withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items.  In this
 
regard, the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, may satisfy, or allow Participant
 
to satisfy, their withholding obligation, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related Items by any of the following, or a
 
combination thereof:
(i)
           
By cash, check or wire transfer of immediately available funds; provided that the
Company may limit the use of one of the foregoing methods if one or more of the methods below is permitted;
(ii)
         
Delivery (including telephonically to the extent permitted by the Company) of a notice
that Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker acceptable to the Company with respect to Shares then
issuable upon settlement of the Performance Shares, and that the broker has been directed to deliver promptly to the
Company funds sufficient to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items; provided that such amount is paid
to the Company at such time as may be required by the Company;
(iii)
        
To the extent permitted by the Administrator, surrendering Shares then issuable upon
settlement of the Performance Shares valued at their Fair Market Value on such date; or
(iv)
        
By the deduction of such amount from salary or other compensation payable to
Participant.
(c)
          
The Company and/or the Employer has the right and option, but not the obligation, to treat
Participant
’
s failure to provide timely payment of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items as Participant
’
s
election to satisfy all or any portion of the Tax-Related Items pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iii) or (iv) above, or a
combination of such sections.
(d)
          
The Company and/or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by
considering applicable statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum
applicable rates in Participant
’
s jurisdiction(s).  In the event of over-withholding, Participant may receive a refund of any
 
over-withheld amount in cash through the Employer
’
s normal payroll processes (with no entitlement to the equivalent in
 
Common Stock) or, if not refunded, Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-
withholding, Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to
 
the Company and/or the Employer.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by surrendering Shares, solely for
 
tax purposes and not intended to modify or restrict in any way Section 4.2 of the Plan, Participant is deemed to have been
 
issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Performance Share, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are
 
surrendered for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
(e)
          
Participant understands and agrees that certain withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items
 
may arise prior to any issuance of Shares or payment of cash under Section 1.4 if the Performance Shares are at any time
 
not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for purposes of Section 83 of the Code (or similar rules under non-U.S.
 
legislation or case law) prior to such date.  If Shares are issued or cash paid on an accelerated basis to satisfy the Federal
 
Insurance Contributions Act tax imposed under Sections 3101, 3121(a) or 3121(v)(2) of the Code (the 
“
FICA Tax
”
) or
comparable non-U.S. tax liabilities as provided in this Section 2.1(e) as a result of the lapse of the substantial risk of
forfeiture for purposes of Section 83 of the Code (or similar rules under non-U.S. legislation or case law)
7
prior to the issuance of Shares or payment of cash under Section 1.4, then Participant may have income tax at source on
wages imposed under Section 3401 of the Code or the corresponding withholding provisions of applicable non-U.S.
federal tax laws, or applicable U.S. or non-U.S. state or local tax laws (together with the FICA Tax, the 
“
FICA-Related
Taxes
”
).  Participant
’
s FICA-Related Taxes shall be satisfied by the deduction of such amount from other compensation
 
payable to Participant.  To the extent the other compensation payable to Participant is determined by the Company to be
 
insufficient to satisfy Participant
’
s FICA-Related Taxes, Participant
’
s acceptance of the Performance Shares hereunder
constitutes Participant
’
s instruction and authorization to the Company to satisfy the FICA-Related Taxes through the
accelerated issuance and withholding of Shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the Performance Shares having a then-
current Fair Market Value not exceeding the amount necessary to satisfy the FICA-Related Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries based on the applicable statutory withholding rates.
(f)
          
Finally, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related
Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of Participant
’
s
 
participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to honor
 
the vesting of the Performance Shares and/or refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds from the sale of the
 
Shares if Participant fails to comply with Participant
’
s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
ARTICLE III.
OTHER PROVISIONS
3.1
        
Nature of Grant
.  In accepting the Performance Shares, Participant understands, acknowledges, and
 
agrees that:
(a)
          
the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be
modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time in accordance with its terms;
(b)
          
the grant of the Performance Shares is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create
any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Shares, or benefits in lieu of Performance Shares,
even if Performance Shares have been granted in the past;
(c)
          
all decisions with respect to future Performance Shares (as defined in the Plan) or other grants,
if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Administrator;
(d)
          
the Performance Share grant and participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment
or be interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with the Company, the Employer, or any
other Subsidiary and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, the Employer or any other Subsidiary, as
applicable, to terminate Participant
’
s employment or service relationship (if any) at any time with or without cause;
(e)
          
Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan;
(f)
          
the Performance Shares and any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income from and value
of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
8
(g)
          
the Performance Shares and any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income from and value
of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation,
termination, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, holiday pay, pension or
retirement benefits, welfare benefits or other similar payments;
(h)
          
the future value of the Shares underlying the Performance Shares is unknown, indeterminable
and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(i)
           
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the
Performance Shares resulting from Participant
’
s Termination of Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later
found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or the terms of
Participant
’
s employment agreement, if any);
(j)
           
for purposes of the Performance Shares, Termination of Service will be deemed to have
occurred as of the date Participant is no longer actively providing services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment
laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or the terms of Participant
’
s employment agreement, if any), and
unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or determined by the Administrator, Participant
’
s right to vest in
the Performance Shares, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g.,
Participant
’
s period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of 
“
garden leave
”
 or similar
period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is employed or the terms of Participant
’
s
employment agreement, if any); the Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no
longer actively providing services for purposes of the Performance Shares (including whether Participant may still be
considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence);
(k)
          
unless otherwise agreed with the Company, the Performance Shares and the Shares underlying
the Performance Shares, and the income from and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection
with, any services Participant may provide as a director of a Subsidiary;
(l)
           
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Administrator, the Performance Shares and the
benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Performance Shares or any such benefits
transferred to, or assumed by, another company, nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with
any corporate transaction affecting the Common Stock;
(m)
        
the following provision shall not apply to Employees in the State of California: In consideration
of the grant of the Performance Shares, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Participant agrees not to institute
any claim against the Company, the Employer or any other Subsidiary, to waive Participant
’
s ability, if any, to bring
such claim, and release the Company, the Employer and any other Subsidiary from any such claim; if, notwithstanding
the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan,
Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agrees to execute any and all
documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; and
9

appendices hereto) and any valid deferral election made pursuant to Section 1.4(c) constitute the entire agreement of the
 
parties and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Participant with respect
 
to the subject matter hereof. Nonetheless, the Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Participant
’

amounts credited and benefits payable, if any, with respect to the Performance Shares and Dividend Equivalents, and

disclosing the inside information to any third party, including fellow employees (other than on a 
“
need to know
”
 basis)
and (ii) 
“
tipping
”
 third parties or causing them to otherwise buy or sell securities. Any restrictions under these laws or
 
regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading
 
policy of the Company.  Participant acknowledges that Participant is responsible for ensuring compliance with any
 
applicable restrictions and should consult Participant

administrative reasons.  The Vesting Appendix and the Global Appendix constitute a part of this Performance Share
 
Award Agreement.

Governing
 Law and Venue

’
s laws other than the
State of Delaware. For purposes of litigating any dispute concerning the grant of the Performance Shares, the Dividend
Equivalents or this Agreement, Participant consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota and agrees that
such litigation shall be conducted exclusively in the courts of Ramsey County, Minnesota, or the federal courts for the
United States for the District of Minnesota, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.
