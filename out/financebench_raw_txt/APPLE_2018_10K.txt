Markets and DistributionThe
 Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells itsproducts
 and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and onlinestores
 and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,retailers
 and resellers. During 2018 ,  the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 29% and 71%, respectively, oftotal net sales.
The
 Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products and services are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey thevalue
 of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providingdirect
 contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-s
ales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.To
 ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to build and improve itsdistribution
 capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Company’s retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations inquality
 shopping  malls and  urban  shopping  districts.  By operating  its  own stores  and  locating  them  in  desirable  high-traffic  locations  the  Company  is betterpositioned
 to ensure a high-quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentationand
 marketing  of  the  Company’s  products  and  related  solutions.  The  retail  stores  employ  experienced  and  knowledgeable  personnel  who  provide  productadvice, service and train
ing, and offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software and other accessories that complement the Company’s products.The
 Company has  also invested in programs to  enhance  reseller sales by placing  high-quality Apple fixtures, merchandising  materials  and other resourceswithin selected third-party reseller locations.
 Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providinga high level of produc
t expertise, integration and support services.The
 Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology intoclassroom
 instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement and has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs ofeducation
 customers. The Company also supports mobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education-related materials through iTunes U ® ,a
 platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its products to the education market throughits direct sales force, select
 third-party resellers and its retail and online stores.The
 Company  also  sells  its  hardware  and  software  products  to  enterprise  and  government  customers  in  each  of  its  reportable  segments.  The  Company’sproducts
 are  deployed  in  these  markets  because  of  their  performance,  productivity,  ease-of-use  and  seamless  integration  into  information  technologyenvironments.
 The Company’s products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the developmentand secure deployment of custom appl
ications as well as remote device administration.No single customer accounted fo
r more than 10% of net sales in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Competition
The
 markets  for  the  Company’s  products  and  services  are  highly  competitive  and  the  Company  is  confronted  by  aggressive  competition  in  all  areas  of  itsbusiness. These markets
 are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilitiesand
 use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital electronic devices. Many of the Company’s competitors that sellmobile
 devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures.The
 Company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins.Principal
 competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance,product
 and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability,service and support and corporate reputat
ion.The
 Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These marketsare
 highly  competitive  and  include  many  large,  well-funded  and  experienced  participants.  The  Company  expects  competition  in  these  markets  to  intensifysignificantly
 as  competitors  attempt  to  imitate  some  of  the  features  of  the  Company’s  products  and  applications  within  their  own  products  or,  alternatively,collaborate
 with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricecompetition,
 frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors andprice sensitivit
y on the part of consumers and businesses.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 
4 
The  Company’s  services  also  face  substantial  competition,  including  from  companies  that  have  significant  resources  and  experience  and  have  establishedservice
 offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competeswith illegitimate means to obt
ain third-party digital content and applications.The
 Company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the Company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products andservices
 in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including thehardware
 (iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV), software (iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content andapplications
 (Digital Content and Services). Some of the Company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to providesuch products and services at 
little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Company’s offerings.Supply of Components
Although
 most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained fromsingle or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the
 markets for mobile communication and mediadevices
 and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at timessubject
 to industry-wide  shortage  and  significant commodity  pricing fluctuations  that  could materially adversely affect  the Company’s  financial condition  andoperating results.
The
 Company  uses  some  custom  components  that  are  not  commonly  used  by  its  competitors,  and  new  products  introduced  by  the  Company  often  utilizecustom
 components  available  from  only  one  source.  When  a  component  or  product  uses  new  technologies,  initial  capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  thesuppliers’
 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed orconstrained,
 or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating resultscould
 be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the timerequired
 to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability ofthese
 components  at  acceptable  prices,  or  at  all,  may  be  affected  if  suppliers  decide  to  concentrate  on  the  production  of  common  components  instead  ofcomponents customized to meet the Compan
y’s requirements.The Company
 has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend orrenew
 these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases thatcould materially adversely affec
t its financial condition and operating results.Substantially
 all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computersmanufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A
 significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often insingle
 locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products.Although
 the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s financial condition and operating results couldbe
 materially  adversely  affected  if  its  outsourcing  partners  were  unable  to  meet  their  production  commitments.  The  Company’s  manufacturing  purchaseobligations typically cover its requirem
ents for periods up to 150 days . Research and Development
Because
 the  industries  in  which  the  Company  competes  are  characterized  by  rapid  technological  advances,  the  Company’s  ability  to  compete  successfullydepends
 heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Companycontinues to
 develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through R&D, licensing of intellectualproperty and acquisition of thi
rd-party businesses and technology.Intellectual Property

 Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software andservices.
 This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and a number offoreign
 countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its successdoes depend in p
art on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 
5 
The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands ofpatent
 applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents andothers.
 The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible forprotecting
 the  Company’s  products.  The  Company  believes  the  duration  of  its  intellectual  property  rights  is  adequate  relative  to  the  expected  lives  of  itsproducts.
Many
 of the Company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renewlicenses relating
 to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses oncommercially
 reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because oftechnological
 changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it ispossible
 that certain components of the Company’s products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights ofothers. From time to time, the Compan
y has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic 
DataDuring
 2018,  the  Company’s  domestic  and  international  net  sales  accounted  for   37% and   63% ,  respectively,  of  total  net  sales.  Gross  margins  on  theCompany’s
 products  in  foreign  countries  and  on  products  that  include  components  obtained  from  foreign  suppliers,  can  be  adversely  affected  by  foreigncurrency exchange rate fluctuation
s and by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties.Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The
 Company  has  historically  experienced  higher  net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holidaydemand. Additionally,
 new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impactthe Company’s net
 sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channelinventory
 of  a particular  product  often  declines as the next  related major product  launch  approaches.  Net sales can  also be  affected  when  consumers anddistributors
 anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be consideredreliable indicator
s of the Company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.Warranty
The
 Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase bythe
 original end user. The Company also offers a 90-day limited warranty on the service parts used to repair the Company’s hardware products. In certainjurisdictions,
 local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute, typically at least two years. In addition, whereavailable, consumers may purc
hase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Company’s hardware products.Backlog
In
 the Company’s experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. Inparticular, backlog ofte
n increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customersbelieve they can
 obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company’s ability to achieve anyparticular level of revenue
 or financial performance.Employees
As of 
September 29, 2018 , the Company had  approximately 132,000 full-time equivalent employees.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K |

Item 1A.Risk Factors The following discussion of
 risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form10-K.
 The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations” and the consolidated finan
cial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.The
 business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, includingbut
 not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operatingresults
 to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materiallyand adversely affect
 the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.Because of the following factor
s, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should notbe considered to be a reliable 
indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.Global
 and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition andgrowth 
. The
 Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, a majority of theCompany’s
 supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performancedepend significantly on 
global and regional economic conditions.Adverse macroeconomic conditio
ns, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit,higher
 interest  rates,  high  unemployment  and  currency  fluctuations  could  materially  adversely  affect  demand  for  the  Company’s  products  and  services.  Inaddition, consumer
 confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the realestate
 and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economicfactors.
In
 addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have asignificant
 impact  on  the  Company’s  suppliers,  contract  manufacturers,  logistics providers,  distributors,  cellular network  carriers  and  other  channel  partners.Potential effects include
 financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.A
 downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivativecounterparties
 and  other  financial  institutions;  limitations  on  the  Company’s  ability  to  issue new  debt;  reduced  liquidity;  and  declines  in  the  fair  value  of  theCompany’s
 financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financialcondition and growth.
Global markets for the Company’s p
roducts and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may beunable to compete effectively in these markets.
The
 Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downwardpressure
 on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement inproduct
 price/performance  characteristics,  rapid  adoption  of  technological  advancements  by  competitors  and  price  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  consumers  andbusinesses.
The
 Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, servicesand
 technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including thehardware,
 operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. Therecan be no assurance that these
 investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and servicessuccessfully.
The
 Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks andservice
 marks.  In  contrast,  many  of  the  Company’s  competitors  seek  to  compete  primarily  through  aggressive  pricing  and  very  low  cost  structures,  andemulating
 the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new productswith
 attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could beadversely affected.

The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets. The Company faces substantial competition inthese
 markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digitalcontent
 supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base ofactive
 devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors mayhave the resources, experience or co
st structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.Additionally,
 the  Company  faces  significant  competition  as  competitors  attempt  to  imitate  the  Company’s  product  features  and  applications  within  their  ownproducts
 or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expectscompetition
 to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or workcollaboratively to offer int
egrated solutions.Some
 of the markets in which the Company competes, including the market for personal computers, have from time to time experienced little to no growth orcontracted. In addition, an increas
ing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditionalpersonal computers comp
ete with some of the Company’s existing products.The
 Company’s  services  also  face  substantial  competition,  including  from  companies  that  have  significant  resources  and  experience  and  have  establishedservice
 offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competeswith illegitimate means to obt
ain third-party digital content and applications.The
 Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services in orderto
 maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services thatcompete effectively.
To
 remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of productsand services.
Due
 to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products,services
 and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services andsuccessfully
 manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on anumber
 of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associatedwith
 new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments andinventory
 levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demandand
 the risk that new products  and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance theultimate effect of new product and serv
ice introductions and transitions.The Company depends on the performance of ca
rriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The
 Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competingmanufacturers.
 The  Company  also  sells  its  products  and  third-party  products  in  most  of  its  major  markets  directly  to  education,  enterprise  and  governmentcustomers and consumers
 and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores.Some
 carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There isno
 assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreementsthe Company enters in
to with new carriers.The
 Company  has  invested  and  will  continue  to  invest  in  programs  to  enhance  reseller  sales,  including  staffing  selected  resellers’  stores  with  Companyemployees
 and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance ofreturn
 or  incremental  revenue.  The  financial  condition  of  these  resellers  could  weaken,  these  resellers  could  stop  distributing  the  Company’s  products,  oruncertainty
 regarding  demand  for  some  or  all  of  the  Company’s  products  could  cause  resellers  to  reduce  their  ordering  and  marketing  of  the  Company’sproducts.

The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The
 Company  records  a  write-down  for  product  and  component  inventories  that  have  become  obsolete  or  exceed  anticipated  demand,  or  for  which  costexceeds
 net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Companyreviews
 long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstancesindicate
 the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by whichthe
 carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets andpurchase
 commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other chargesgiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of p
roduct obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The
 Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments.  Manufacturing  purchaseobligations cover the Company’s forecasted component
 and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days . Because the Company’s markets are
 volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess orinsufficient amounts of
 components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.Future operating results depend upon the Co
mpany’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because
 the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Manycomponents,
 including  those  that  are  available  from  multiple  sources,  are  at  times  subject  to  industry-wide  shortages  and  significant  commodity  pricingfluctuations
 that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements forthe
 supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Component
 suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry,further
 limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economicconditions
 on  the  Company’s  suppliers,  described  in “
 Global
and
regional
economic
conditions
could
materially
adversely
affect
the
Company’s
business,results

of
operations,
financial
condition
and
growth
”
 above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components .
 Therefore, the Company remainssubject to significant risks of
 supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.The
 Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initialcapacity
 constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components atacceptable
 prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common componentsinstead
 of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed orconstrained,
 or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating resultscould
 be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the timerequired to obtain sufficient quant
ities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.The
 Company  depends  on  component  and  product  manufacturing  and  logistical  services  provided  by  outsourcing  partners,  many  of  which  arelocated outside of the U.S.
Substantially all
 of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration ofthis
 manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of itstransportation
 and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over productionand distribution.
 Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond tochanging
 conditions.  Although  arrangements  with  these  partners  may  contain  provisions  for  warranty  expense  reimbursement,  the  Company  may  remainresponsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of
 product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. Whilethe Company relies on its pa
rtners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.The
 Company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcingpartners primarily 
located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have anegative
 impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to finaldestinations
 may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures,commercial disputes, military actions, 
economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 
10 
The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments tocertain
 of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, ifthese
 outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced orterminated and the recoverabil
ity of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted.The
 Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affectthe Company’s business and result in harm to 
the Company’s reputation.The
 Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operatingsystem
 software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation ofhardware
 or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could makethe
 Company’s  products  unsafe  and  create  a  risk  of  environmental  or  property  damage  and  personal  injury.  These  risks  may  increase  as  the  Company’sproducts are introduced into spec
ialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time totime
 experience  outages,  service  slowdowns  or  errors.  As  a  result,  the  Company’s  services  may  not  perform  as  anticipated  and  may  not  meet  customerexpectations.
 There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers.Failure
 to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company may beexposed
 to  product  liability  claims,  recalls,  product  replacements  or  modifications,  write-offs  of  inventory,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and/or  intangibleassets,
 and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems could also adversely affect the experiencefor
 users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance,reduced demand for products and service
s, delay in new product and services introductions and lost revenue.The Company relies on access to third-par
ty digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company contracts with nume
rous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TVshows and
 books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation orrenewal
 of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competingproducts
 and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future.Other
 content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unableto
 continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain theright to
 make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact onthe Company’s financia
l condition and operating results.Some
 third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, theCompany may have to develop or l
icense new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license suchsolutions
 at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force theCompany
 to  license  its  digital  rights  management,  which  could  lessen  the  protection  of  content  and  subject  it  to  piracy  and  also  could  negatively  affectarrangements with the
 Company’s content providers.The Company’s future perfor
mance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The
 Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications andservices. There is no assu
rance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products.If
 third-party  software  applications  and  services cease  to  be  developed  and  maintained  for  the  Company’s  products,  customers  may  choose  not  to  buy  theCompany’s products.
The
 Company  believes  the  availability  of  third-party  software  applications  and  services  for  its  products  depends  in  part  on  the  developers’  perception  andanalysis
 of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’platforms,
 such  as  Android  for  smartphones  and  tablets  and  Windows  for  personal  computers.  This  analysis  may  be  based  on  factors  such  as  the  marketposition
 of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developingsuch applications and services.
Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 
11 
The  Company’s  minority  market  share  in  the  global  smartphone,  tablet  and  personal  computer  markets  could  make  developers  less  inclined  to  develop  orupgrade
 software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products withlarger
 market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices maysuffer.
The
 Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s productsand
 operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change,third-party
 applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result indissatisfied customers.
The
 Company sells and delivers third-party  applications for its products  through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store. The Company retains acommission
 from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases tocustomers, then the volume of sales, and the 
commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.The
 Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms orat all.
Many
 of  the  Company’s  products  include  third-party  intellectual  property,  which  requires  licenses  from  those  third  parties.  Based  on  past  experience  andindustry
 practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessarylicenses
 can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property oncommercially
 reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on theCompany’s financial condition an
d operating results.The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results o
f legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights . The
 Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, andnew
 claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject theCompany to costs and damages in the event of a c
laim against an indemnified third party.Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other
 violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time andmay
 continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, andnew
 claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and oftenenter
 into  litigation  based  on  allegations  of  patent  infringement  or  other  violations  of  intellectual  property  rights.  The  Company  is  vigorously  defendinginfringement
 actions  in  courts  in  a  number  of  U.S.  jurisdictions  and  before  the  U.S.  International  Trade  Commission,  as  well  as  internationally  in  variouscountries. The plaintiffs 
in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless
 of  the  merit  of  particular  claims,  litigation  may  be  expensive,  time  consuming,  disruptive  to  the  Company’s  operations  and  distracting  tomanagement.
 In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolvesuch
 disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements mayalso significantly increase the Com
pany’s operating expenses.Except
 as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies” underthe heading
 “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or amaterial
 loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement ofintellectual property rights.
The
 outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reportingperiod
 for  amounts  in  excess  of  management’s  expectations,  the  Company’s  financial  condition  and  operating  results  for  that  reporting  period  could  bematerially
 adversely  affected.  Further,  such  an  outcome  could  result  in  significant  compensatory,  punitive  or  trebled  monetary  damages,  disgorgement  ofrevenue
 or  profits,  remedial  corporate  measures  or  injunctive  relief  against  the  Company  that  could  materially  adversely  affect  its  financial  condition  andoperating results.
While
 the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types ofclaims that may arise.

The  Company  is  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  worldwide,  changes  to  which  could  increase  the  Company’s  costs  and  individually  or  in  theaggregate adversely affect the Company’s business.
The
 Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws andregulations
 affect the Company’s activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions,
 quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement,tax,
 import  and  export  requirements,  anti-corruption,  foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  and  data  localizationrequirements, anti-competit
ion, environmental, health and safety.By
 way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates areextensive
 and  subject  to  change.  Such  changes  could  include,  among  others,  restrictions  on  the  production,  manufacture,  distribution  and  use  of  devices,locking
 devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network. These devices are also subject to certification andregulation
 by  governmental  and  standardization  bodies,  as  well  as  by  cellular  network  carriers  for  use  on  their  networks.  These  certification  processes  areextensive and
 time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could precludethe Company from selling cer
tain products.Compliance
 with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,further
 increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulationsor in
 their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay theintroduction
 of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policiesand
 procedures  designed  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  but  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  Company’s  employees,contractors, or age
nts will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures.The Company’s business is subject to the risks of interna
tional operations.The Company derives
 a majority of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations,such
 as  import  and  export  requirements,  anti-corruption  laws,  tax  laws,  foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  and  datalocalization
 requirements,  environmental  laws,  labor  laws  and  anti-competition  regulations,  increases  the  costs  of  doing  business  in  foreign  jurisdictions.Although
 the  Company  has  implemented  policies  and  procedures  to  comply  with  these  laws  and  regulations,  a  violation  by  the  Company’s  employees,contractors
 or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulationsof another country. Violations of these 
laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company’s brand, international growth efforts and business.The
 Company  also  could  be  significantly  affected  by  other  risks  associated  with  international  activities  including,  but  not  limited  to,  economic  and  laborconditions,
 increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability and international trade disputes. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreigncountries,
 and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations,including duties,
 tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certaininternational markets. There can be no a
ssurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The
 Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject tonumerous risks and uncertainties.
The
 Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel.The
 Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile
 venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investmentthan
 the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure orpoor
 performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements andseverance costs.
The Company’s retail operations
 are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition andoperating
 results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, theCompany’s
 ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costsassociated with fluctuat
ions in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K |

Investment  in  new  business  strategies  and  acquisitions  could  disrupt  the  Company’s  ongoing  business  and  present  risks  not  originallycontemplated.
The
 Company  has  invested,  and  in  the  future  may  invest,  in  new  business  strategies  or  acquisitions.  Such  endeavors  may  involve  significant  risks  anduncertainties,
 including  distraction  of  management  from  current  operations,  greater  than  expected  liabilities  and  expenses,  inadequate  return  of  capital  andunidentified issues not di
scovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by in
formation technology system failures or network disruptions.The
 Company  may  be  subject  to  information  technology  system  failures  or  network  disruptions  caused  by  natural  disasters,  accidents,  power  disruptions,telecommunications
 failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy andother
 continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for alleventualities.
 Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s onlineservices,
 interfering  with  customer  transactions  or  impeding  the  manufacturing  and  shipping  of  the  Company’s  products.  These  events  could  materiallyadversely affect the Company’
s reputation, financial condition and operating results.There
 may  be  losses  or  unauthorized  access  to  or  releases  of  confidential  information,  including  personally  identifiable  information,  that  couldsubject the Company to significant reputational, 
financial, legal and operational consequences.The
 Company’s  business  requires  it  to  use  and  store  confidential  information  including,  among  other  things,  personally  identifiable  information  (“PII”)  withrespect
 to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use ofencryption
 and  other  security  measures  intended  to  protect  its  systems  and  data.  But  these  measures  cannot  provide  absolute  security,  and  losses  orunauthorized
 access to or releases of confidential  information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation,  financial condition andoperating results.
The
 Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secureconfidential
 information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidentialinformation occur and c
ould materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.For
 example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality,integrity or
 availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for itsproducts
 and  services,  impact  the  Company’s  stock  price,  materially  damage  supplier  relationships,  and  expose  the  Company  to  litigation  or  governmentinvestigations, which could result
 in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.Although
 malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Companyis
 at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores andprocesses.
The
 Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss ofsensitive data,
 including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient forall
 eventualities  and  may  be  vulnerable  to  hacking,  employee  error,  malfeasance,  system  error,  faulty  password  management  or  other  irregularities.  Forexample, third parties a
ttempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may inturn
 be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services andsystems
 for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customerorders or impede custom
er access to the Company’s products and services.In
 addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to healthdata
 and payment card data. Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subjectto audit
 by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules andrequirements, or
 if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company couldbe subject to litigation 
or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 
14 
Under  payment  card  rules  and  obligations,  if  cardholder  information  is  potentially  compromised,  the  Company  could  be  liable  for  associated  investigatoryexpenses
 and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could alsoexperience
 a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry datasecurity standards, which would
 materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.While the Company mainta
ins insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficientto cover all losses or all types
 of claims that may arise.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and in
ternational laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The
 Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these lawsapply
 not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions havepassed
 laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent fromjurisdiction
 to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require theCompany to change its
 business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The
 Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Anyfailure by
 the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulationscould
 result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing auditrequirements and significan
t legal liability.The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key pe
rsonnel.Much
 of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive teamand
 other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especiallyin Silicon Valley, where most of t
he Company’s key personnel are located.The
 Company’s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues,industrial accidents and other business interruptions.
Political
 events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions couldharm
 or  disrupt  international  commerce  and  the  global  economy,  and  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company  and  its  customers,  suppliers,contract manufactur
ers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could
 adversely affect the Company’s business. Tariffs could increase thecost
 of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the grossmargin
 that  the  Company  earns  on  its  products.  Tariffs  could  also  make  the  Company’s  products  more  expensive  for  customers,  which  could  make  theCompany’s
 products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Company’sability
 to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negativeeffect on consumer confidence and spending, 
which could adversely affect the Company’s business.Many
 of the Company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locationsthat
 are  prone  to  earthquakes  and  other  natural  disasters.  In  addition,  such  operations  and  facilities  are  subject  to  the  risk  of  interruption  by  fire,  powershortages,
 nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and otherevents
 beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intenseeffects.
 Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficienciesin
 the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to itsbusiness, the
 Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, and lose significant revenue.Because
 the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting suchsources would exacerbate any negat
ive consequences to the Company.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 
15 
The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers arerequired
 to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business andharm
 to the Company’s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringentemployee
 travel  restrictions,  additional  limitations  in  freight  services,  governmental  actions  limiting  the  movement  of  products  between  regions,  delays  inproduction ramps of new products and d
isruptions in the operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers.The Company expects its quarterly revenue and ope
rating results to fluctuate.The
 Company’s  profit  margins  vary  across  its  products,  services,  geographic  segments  and  distribution  channels.  For  example,  gross  margins  on  theCompany’s
 hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, andcomponent,
 warranty  and  other  cost  fluctuations.  The  Company’s  financial  results  may  be  materially  adversely  impacted  as  a  result  of  shifts  in  the  mix  ofproducts
 and  services  that  the  Company  sells;  shifts  in  the  geographic,  currency  or  channel  mix  of  the  Company’s  sales;  component  cost  increases;  pricecompetition; or the introduction of ne
w products, including new products with higher cost structures.The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other
 quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, newproduct
 introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales froma
 single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpecteddevelopments,
 such  as  lower-than-anticipated  demand  for  the  Company’s  products,  issues  with  new  product  introductions,  information  technology  systemfailures or network disruptions
, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.
The
 Company’s  stock  price  has  experienced  substantial  price  volatility  in  the  past  and  may  continue  to  do  so  in  the  future.  Additionally,  the  Company,  thetechnology
 industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways thatmay
 have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Companyrepurchases
 its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growthand
 profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that itscurrent
 share  repurchase  program  will  be  fully  consummated.  Future  dividends  are  subject  to  declaration  by  the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors,  and  theCompany’s
 share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to futuregrowth,
 profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverseimpact on investor confidence and e
mployee retention.The Company’s financial performance is subject 
to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The
 Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated  sales and operating expensesworldwide.
 Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could bematerially adverse
ly affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Weakening
 of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales andearnings,
 and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, forcompetitive
 or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affectthe U.S. dollar value of the gros
s margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Conversely,
 a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated salesand
 earnings,  could  cause  the  Company  to  reduce  international  pricing  and  incur  losses  on  its  foreign  currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  thebenefit.
 Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  increase  the  Company’s  cost  of  product  components  denominated  in  those  currencies,  thusadversely affecting gross
 margins.The
 Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange
 rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorablemovements in foreign exchange rates o
ver the limited time the hedges are in place.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 
16 
The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.The
 Company’s  investments  can  be  negatively  affected  by  liquidity,  credit  deterioration,  financial  results,  market  and  economic  conditions,  political  risk,sovereign
 risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesmay
 fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities,future
 fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition andoperating results.
The
 Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supplyagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when econo
mic conditions worsen.The
 Company  distributes  its products  through  third-party  cellular  network  carriers,  wholesalers,  retailers  and  resellers.  The  Company  also  sells its productsdirectly
 to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding tradereceivables
 are  not  covered  by  collateral,  third-party  bank  support  or  financing  arrangements,  or  credit  insurance.  The  Company’s  exposure  to  credit  andcollectibility
 risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also hasunsecured
 vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assembliesor assemble final
 products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply ofinventory
 components. As of September  29, 2018 ,  a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers,and
 its  vendor  non-trade  receivables  and  prepayments  related  to  long-term  supply  agreements  were  concentrated  among  a  few  individual  vendors  locatedprimarily
 in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, t
here can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The
 Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional taxliabilities.
The Company is subject to taxes in the
 U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized.Due
 to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could beaffected
 by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  orchanges in tax laws or thei
r interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.The
 Company  is  also  subject  to  the  examination  of  its  tax  returns  and  other  tax  matters  by  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Service  (the  “IRS”)  and  other  taxauthorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome
 resulting from these examinations to determine theadequacy
 of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase,particularly
 in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, theCompany’s financial condition, o
perating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.Item 1B.

Item 2.Properties The
 Company’s  headquarters  are  located  in  Cupertino,  California.  As  of September  29,  2018 ,  the  Company  owned  16.5  million  square  feet  and  leased24.3 million square feet
 of building space, primarily in the U.S. Additionally, the Company owned a total of 7,376 acres of land, primarily in the U.S.As
 of September  29, 2018 ,  the Company owned facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D and data centers at various locations throughout the U.S.Outside the U.S., the Company owned add
itional facilities and land for various purposes.The
 Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for theconduct
 of its business. The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors and continues to makeinvestments in capital equ
ipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products and services.Item 3.
Legal Proceedings The
 Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Except asdescribed in
 Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading“Contingencies,”
 in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a materialloss in excess of a recorded a
ccrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.The
 outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess ofmanagement’s
 expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Refer tothe

 decreased  year-over-year  due primarily to higher product  costs, partially offset  by a favorable  shift in mix to Services. The weakness in foreigncurrencies relative to the 
U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on gross margin and gross margin percentage during 2017.The
 Company anticipates gross margin percentage during the first quarter of 2019 to  be between 38.0% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement regarding theCompany’s
 expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2019 is  forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future grossmargins can be impacted by mu
ltiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” andthose
 described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to avariety
 of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response tosuch pressures; increased co
mpetition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; potentialincreases
 in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shiftsin
 the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the Company’sfrequent introductions and transit
ions of products and services.Operating Expenses

 to support expanded R&D activities. R&D expense increased during 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to increases in headcount-related expensesand
 material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth andcompetitive
 position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core businessstrategy.

 December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S.statutory
 federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreignincome.
 By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the “2018 blended U.S. tax rate”). TheAct also created a n
ew minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings.The
 Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 was  lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offsetby the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities as a result of the Act.The
 Company’s  effective  tax  rates  for 2017 and 2016 were  lower  than  the  historical  statutory  federal  income  tax  rate  of  35%  due  primarily  to  certainundistributed
 foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes were provided whensuch earnings were intended to be indef
initely reinvested outside the U.S.The
 lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared  to 2017 was  due primarily to the lower 2018 blended U.S. tax rate, partially offset by the remeasurement ofdeferred
 tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act. The lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due  to a different geographic mix of earningsand higher U.S. R&D tax cre
dits.As

Accounting
(“ASU  2016-09”), in 2018, the Company records any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards as part of theprovision
 for income taxes. The Company anticipates that these excess tax benefits or deficiencies will have the greatest impact on its effective tax rates in thefirst and third quarters, as the ma
jority of the Company’s equity awards vest in those quarters.As
 of September  29, 2018 ,  the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $6.3  billion and deferred
 tax liabilities of $426  million .  Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as aresult
 of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the deferred taxassets.
 The  Company  will  continue  to  evaluate  the  realizability  of  deferred  tax  assets  quarterly  by  assessing  the  need  for  and  the  amount  of  a  valuationallowance.
On
 August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and2007
 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision orderedIreland
 to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated tobe 
€13.1 billion ,  plus interest of €1.2 billion .  Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that dateforward.
 The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union.Ireland
 has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the StateAid
 Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of September  29, 2018 ,  the entire recoveryamount plus interest was
 funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals.On

(“ASU 2017-12”).  ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of theeffects
 of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 inits
 first  quarter  of  2020  utilizing  the  modified  retrospective  transition  method  and  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  adoption  on  its  consolidated  financialstatements.

(“ASU 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of
 the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company willadopt
 ASU 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Currently, the Company estimates recording $3 billion of netdeferred
 tax assets on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 will depend on thebalance
 of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date, as well as the deferred tax impact of the new minimum tax oncertain future foreign earnings. The 
Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these net deferred tax assets are utilized.Leases
In
 February  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2016-02, Leases 
(Topic

(“ASU  2016-02”),  which  modifies  lease  accounting  for  lessees  to  increasetransparency
 and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. TheCompany will adopt A
SU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarterof
 2020. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of September 29, 2018 , the Company anticipates
 recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $8.9 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to itsCondensed
 Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company’s lease portfolio as ofthe adoption date.

Deemed
Repatriation
Tax
PayableAs
 of September  29, 2018 ,  a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemedrepatriation tax payable impo
sed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.Other
Non-Current
Liabilities
The
 Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of thetiming of payments; therefore, such amount
s are not included in the above contractual obligation table.Indemnification
Agreements entered
 into by the Company may include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claimagainst
 an  indemnified  third  party.  Except  as  disclosed  in  Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Note  9,“Commitments
 and  Contingencies”  under  the  heading  “Contingencies,”  in  the  opinion  of  management,  there  was  not  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility  theCompany may have incurred
 a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.The
 Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China.The
 iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certainconditions
 are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right,with subsequent changes to the guarantee liab
ility recognized within revenue.The
 Company  has  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  its  directors  and  executive  officers.  Under  these  agreements,  the  Company  has  agreed  toindemnify such
 individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, andto
 advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount ofpayments
 the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts andcircumstances
 involved  in  each  claim.  While  the  Company  maintains  directors  and  officers  liability  insurance  coverage,  such  insurance  coverage  may  beinsufficient to cover all losses 
or all types of claims that may arise.Critical Accounting Po
licies and EstimatesThe
 preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’sdiscussion and
 analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates thataffect the amounts reported in
 its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notesto Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of
 this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of theCompany’s
 consolidated financial statements.  Management  bases its estimates on historical experience  and on various other assumptions it believes to bereasonable
 under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual resultsmay differ from these estimates, and 
such differences may be material.Management
 believes  the  Company’s  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  are  those  related  to  revenue  recognition,  valuation  and  impairment  ofmarketable
 securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs,income
 taxes,  and  legal  and  other  contingencies.  Management  considers  these  policies  critical  because  they  are  both  important  to  the  portrayal  of  theCompany’s
 financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. TheCompany’s senior
 management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’sBoard of Directors.

Revenue RecognitionNet
 sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. TheCompany recognizes
 revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectionis probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been
 shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Formost
 of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to educationcustomers
 in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portionof
 the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as paymentsbecome
 due  unless  the  Company  has  positive  evidence  that  the  sales  price  is  fixed  or  determinable,  such  as  a  successful  history  of  collection,  withoutconcession,
 on  comparable  arrangements.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  from  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  software  bundled  with  hardware  that  isessential
 to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accountingguidance.
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:(i) standalone
 sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of thehardware.
For
 multi-element  arrangements  that  include  hardware  products  containing  software  essential  to  the  hardware  product’s  functionality,  undelivered  softwareelements
 that relate to the hardware product’s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverablesbased
 on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue todeliverables:
 (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price(“ESP”).
 VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.ESPs reflect the Company
’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.For
 sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and certain other products, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades tothe
 device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified softwareupgrade
 rights  or  the  non-software  services,  revenue  is  allocated  to  these  rights  and  services  based  on  the  Company’s  ESPs.  Revenue  allocated  to  theunspecified
 software  upgrade  rights  and  non-software  services based on  the  Company’s  ESPs is deferred  and  recognized  on  a straight-line basis over  theestimated period the software upgrades and non
-software services are expected to be provided.The
 Company’s process for determining ESPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon theunique
 facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s ESPs and the future rate of relatedamortization
 for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to changeinclude the
 unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-softwareservices and the estimated per
iod unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.The
 Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactionsinvolving
 price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably andreliably
 estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company’s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated,revenue
 is  not  recognized  until  reliable  estimates  can  be  made  or  the  price  protection  lapses.  For  the  Company’s  other  customer  incentive  programs,  theestimated
 cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company alsorecords
 reductions  to  revenue  for  expected  future  product  returns  based  on  the  Company’s  historical  experience.  Future  market  conditions  and  producttransitions
 may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customerincentive
 programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management’s estimates are based onhistorical
 experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems suchincentives,
 the  Company  would  be  required  to  record  additional  reductions  to  revenue,  which  would  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  Company’s  operatingresults.

Valuation and Impairment of Marketable SecuritiesThe
 Company’s  investments  in  available-for-sale  securities  are  reported  at  fair  value.  Unrealized  gains  and  losses  related  to  changes  in  the  fair  value  ofsecurities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the
 Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fairvalue of
 available-for-sale securities impact the Company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized.Realized
 gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews itsinvestment
 portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in theperiod
 any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fairvalue
 of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will morelikely
 than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company’s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily
 impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have anadverse impact on th
e Company’s financial condition and operating results.Inventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing
-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation FeesThe
 Company  purchases  components  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  shipments  and  invests  in  manufacturing-related  assets,  including  capitalassets
 held at its suppliers’ facilities. In addition, the Company makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements tosecure
 supply of inventory. The Company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cyclestatus,
 product  development  plans,  current  sales  levels  and  component  cost  trends.  If  the  Company  determines  inventories  of  components  and  products,including
 third-party products held for resale, have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value, it records a write-down ofthe
 inventories.  The  Company  also  reviews  its  manufacturing-related  capital  assets  and  inventory  prepayments  for  impairment  whenever  events  orcircumstances
 indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records animpairment loss equal to the
 amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value. Any write-downs and/or impairments the Company maybe required to recor
d would adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The
 Company  accrues  for  estimated  purchase  commitment  cancellation  fees  related  to  inventory  orders  that  have  been  canceled  or  are  expected  to  becanceled. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and
 manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days .
 If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product development plans, oran
 unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record accruals for cancellationfees that would adversely affect 
its operating results.Warranty Costs
The
 Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates,historical
 and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside of the Company’s typical experience. The Company regularly reviewsthese
 estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warrantyliabilities would be required and c
ould materially affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Income Taxes
The
 Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed usingthe
 asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differencesbetween
 the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilitiesare
 measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized orsettled. The Company records a va
luation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.The
 Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by thetaxing
 authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measuredbased on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% 
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K |

Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies,together
 with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the Company’s deferred tax assets. In the event that theCompany
 determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowanceand
 a corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment inestimating
 the  impact  of  uncertainties  in  the  application  of  GAAP  and  complex  tax  laws.  Resolution  of  these  uncertainties  in  a  manner  inconsistent  withmanagement’s expectations could ha
ve a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.On
 December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Act, which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income taxrate
 from 35% to 21% effective  January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created anew minimum
 tax on certain future foreign earnings. The impact of the Act increased the Company’s provision for income taxes by $1.5 billion during 2018. This increase
 was  composed  of $2.0  billion related  to  the  remeasurement  of  net  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  and $1.2  billion associated  with  the  deemedrepatriation
 tax, partially offset by a $1.7 billion impact  the deemed repatriation tax had on the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits. Certain amounts reportedby
 the  Company  related  to  the  Act  are  provisional  estimates  in  accordance  with  the  SEC Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  No.  118.  Resolution  of  the  Act’s  effectsdifferent from the assumptions made by the 
Company could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other Contingencies
As
 discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial
 Statements in Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinarycourse of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has
 been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determinationof
 which requires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9,“Commitments
 and  Contingencies”  under  the  heading  “Contingencies,”  in  the  opinion  of  management,  there  was  not  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility  theCompany
 may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and otherclaims.
The
 outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess ofmanagement’s expectations, the Compan
y’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Ma rket RiskInterest Rate and Foreign Cur
rency Risk ManagementThe
 Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction withits underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of
 the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory natureof
 the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreignexchange
 or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and lossesrelated to the underlying economi
c exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Interest Rate Risk
The
 Company’s  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  relates  primarily  to  the  Company’s  investment  portfolio  and  outstanding  debt.  While  the  Company  isexposed to global interest rate flu
ctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S.interest
 rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well ascosts associated with hedg
ing and interest paid on the Company’s debt.The
 Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company usesa
 combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests inhighly
 rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securitiesto
 be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated withthe Company’s
 investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value ofthe investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in
 the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 29, 2018 and September 30,2017 
,  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.9 billion and $6.0 billion incremental decline in the fairmarket value of the
 portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 
35 
As of September  29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 ,  the  Company  had  outstanding  floating-  and  fixed-rate  notes  with  varying  maturities  for  an  aggregatecarrying
 amount of $102.5  billion and $103.7 billion ,  respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manageinterest
 rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments orfloating-rate
 payments  into  fixed-rate  payments.  Gains  and  losses  on  term  debt  are  generally  offset  by  the  corresponding  losses  and  gains  on  the  relatedhedging
 instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September  29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 
to increase by $399  million and $376 million on an annualized basis, respectively.Further details regarding the Company’s debt
 is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Debt.”Foreign Currency Risk
In
 general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening ofthe
 U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have toadjust local currency p
roduct pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.The
 Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated withcertain
 existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition,the
 Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on itsforeign
 currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenueand
 inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety ofreasons including, but not l
imited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.To
 provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Companyperformed
 a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consistedof
 using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expectedloss
 in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model isnot
 intended  to  represent  actual  losses  but  is  used  as  a  risk  estimation  and  management  tool.  Forecasted  transactions,  firm  commitments  and  assets  andliabilities
 denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, amaximum
 one-day  loss  in  fair  value  of  $592  million  as  of September  29,  2018 compared  to  a  maximum  one-day  loss  in  fair  value  of  $485  million  as  ofSeptember 30, 2017 
. Because  the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments aregenerally offset by increase
s in the fair value of the underlying exposures.Actual
 future  gains  and  losses  associated  with  the  Company’s  investment  portfolio,  debt  and  derivative  positions  may  differ  materially  from  the  sensitivityanalyses
 performed as of September  29, 2018 due  to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,foreign currency exchange rates and the 
Company’s actual exposures and positions.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K |

Apple Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 – Summary of Significan
t Accounting PoliciesApple
 Inc.  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  (collectively  “Apple”  or  the  “Company”)  designs,  manufactures  and  markets  mobile  communication  and  mediadevices
 and personal computers, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories and third-party digital content and applications. The Company’sproducts
 and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, Apple TV, HomePod, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications,iOS,
 macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems, iCloud, Apple Pay and a variety of other accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells anddelivers
 digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store, Book Store and Apple Music (collectively “DigitalContent
 and Services”). The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-partycellular
 network  carriers,  wholesalers,  retailers  and  resellers.  In  addition,  the  Company  sells  a  variety  of  third-party  Apple-compatible  products,  includingapplication
 software  and  various  accessories,  through  its  retail  and  online  stores.  The  Company  sells  to  consumers,  small  and  mid-sized  businesses  andeducation, enterprise and government custo
mers.Basis of Presentation
 and PreparationThe
 accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Inthe
 opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessaryfor
 fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generallyaccepted
 accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differmaterially
 from  those  estimates.  Certain  prior  period  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  have  been  reclassified  toconform to the current period’s pre
sentation.The
 Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2018 and 2016 spanned 52weeks
 each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, torealign
 the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to theCompany’s fiscal 
years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.Revenue Recognition
Net
 sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. TheCompany recognizes
 revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectionis probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been
 shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Formost
 of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to educationcustomers
 in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portionof
 the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as paymentsbecome
 due  unless  the  Company  has  positive  evidence  that  the  sales  price  is  fixed  or  determinable,  such  as  a  successful  history  of  collection,  withoutconcession,
 on  comparable  arrangements.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  from  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  software  bundled  with  hardware  that  isessential
 to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accountingguidance.
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:(i) standalone
 sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of thehardware.
For
 the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishesits
 own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk foramounts
 billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunesStore,
 the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts forsuch
 sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that isremitted
 by  the  Company  to  third-party  app  developers  and  certain  digital  content  owners  is  not  reflected  in  the  Company’s  Consolidated  Statements  ofOperations.

The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amountsthat
 have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products.The
 Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TVApp
 Store and Book Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relievedupon
 redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverageperiods.
 AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic toolsoffered under the Company’s standard l
imited warranty.The
 Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactionsinvolving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount

 estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program isoffered.
 The  Company  also  records  reductions  to  revenue  for  expected  future  product  returns  based  on  the  Company’s  historical  experience.  Revenue  isrecorded net
 of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remittedto the relevant government authority.

DeliverablesFor
 multi-element  arrangements  that  include  hardware  products  containing  software  essential  to  the  hardware  product’s  functionality,  undelivered  softwareelements
 that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverablesbased
 on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue todeliverables:
 (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price(“ESP”).
 VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.ESPs
 reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-elementarrangements accounted
 for in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on theVSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not e
xist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.For
 sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and certain other products, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades tothe
 device’s  essential  software  and/or  non-software  services  free  of  charge.  The  Company  has  identified  up  to three deliverables  regularly  included  inarrangements
 involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware andsoftware essential
 to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifyingdevices
 to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the product’s essential software. The third deliverable isthe
 non-software  services  to  be  provided  to  qualifying  devices.  The  Company  allocates  revenue  between  these  deliverables  using  the  relative  selling  pricemethod.
 Because  the  Company  has  neither  VSOE  nor  TPE  for  these  deliverables,  the  allocation  of  revenue  is  based  on  the  Company’s  ESPs.  Revenueallocated
 to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale, provided the other conditions for revenue recognitionhave
 been  met.  Revenue  allocated  to  the  embedded  unspecified  software  upgrade  rights  and  the  non-software  services  is  deferred  and  recognized  on  astraight-line
 basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to deliveredhardware and
 related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software servicesare recognized as cost of sales a
s incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.The Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the
 unique factsand
 circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,product-specific
 business objectives, estimated cost to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software servicesas compared to the total selling p
rice of the product.Shipping Costs
Amounts billed to customers
 related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost ofsales.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expe
nsed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K |

Share-Based CompensationThe
 Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizesexpense
 on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be foundin Note 8, “Benefit Plans.”
During
 the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.2016-09,

Share-Based
Payment
Accounting
(“ASU  2016-09”), which modifiedcertain
 aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and classification in the statement ofcash
 flows. Historically, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the Company’s equity awards were recorded as additional paid-in capital in its ConsolidatedBalance
 Sheets and were classified as a financing activity in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Beginning in 2018, the Company records any excesstax
 benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for income taxes in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the reporting periodsin
 which  equity  vesting  occurs.  The  Company  elected  to  apply  the  cash  flow  classification  requirements  related  to  excess  tax  benefits  retrospectively  to  allperiods
 presented, which resulted in an increase to cash generated by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of $627  million and $407 million 
for 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Earnings Per Share

All
 highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s marketable debtand
 equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term orlong-term
 based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as short-termbased
 on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identificationmethod.
Inventories
Inventories are computed using the fi
rst-in, first-out method.Property, Plant and Equipment
Depreciation
 on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is thelesser
 of 30  years or  the remaining life of the underlying building; between one and five years for  machinery and equipment, including product  tooling andmanufacturing
 process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software areamortized
 on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years .  Depreciation and amortization expense onproperty and equipment was 
$9.3 billion , $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. During 
2018 ,  non-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase to accounts payable and other current liabilities of$3.4 billion

Fair Value MeasurementsThe
 Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are derived from quotedprices
 in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and allother
 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations usingsignificant inputs der
ived from or corroborated by observable market data.Note 2 – Financial Instruments

The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investmentpolicy
 generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for eachindividual
 security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as thelength
 of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in marketinterest
 rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’scost basis. As of 
September 29, 2018 , the Company does not consider any of it s investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.Derivative Financial Instruments
The
 Company  may  use  derivatives  to  partially  offset  its  business  exposure  to  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  risk  on  expected  future  cash  flows,  netinvestments
 in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for avariety
 of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be noassurance the hedges will off
set more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.To protect gross margins from f
luctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollarmay hedge a portion of
 forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecastedinventory
 purchases  not  denominated  in  the  subsidiaries’  functional  currencies.  The  Company  may  enter  into  forward  contracts,  option  contracts  or  otherinstruments
 to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreigncurrency exposure associated 
with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months . To
 protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forwardand
 option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Inaddition,
 the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certainforeign subsidiaries. In both of the
se cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.To
 protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Companymay
 enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurementgains
 or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September  29, 2018 , the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketab
le securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 24 years . The Company
 may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated bythe remeasurement 
of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.To
 protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter intointerest rate
 swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value.The
 Company  designates  these  instruments  as  either  cash  flow  or  fair  value  hedges.  As  of September  29,  2018 ,  the  Company’s  hedged  interest  ratetransactions are expected to be recogni
zed within 9 years . Cash
Flow
Hedges
The
 effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized inearnings.
 Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the sameperiod
 as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a componentof
 cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income orexpense are
 recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flowhedges,
 changes  in  the  time  value  are  excluded  from  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness.  The  ineffective  portions  and  amounts  excluded  from  theeffectiveness testing of cash flo
w hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net.Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it
 is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur inthe
 initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instrumentsare
 reclassified  into  other  income/(expense),  net  in  the  period  of  de-designation.  Any  subsequent  changes  in  fair  value  of  such  derivative  instruments  arereflected in other income/(expen

 ineffective  portions  and  amounts  excluded  from  the  effectiveness  testing  of  net  investment  hedges  are  recognized  in  other  income/(expense),  net.  Forforward
 exchange  contracts  designated  as  net  investment  hedges,  the  Company  excludes  changes  in  fair  value  relating  to  changes  in  the  forward  carrycomponent
 from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the currentperiod.

Gains
 and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value ofthe underlying hedged item in the same

Derivatives
Derivatives that
 are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivativerelates.
 As a result, during 2018 ,  the Company recognized a gain of $20  million in  net sales, a gain of $85  million in  cost of sales and a loss of $198  million in other
 income/(expense), net. During 2017 ,  the Company recognized a gain of $20  million in  net sales, a loss of $40  million in  cost of sales and a gain of $606 million 
in other income/(expense), net. The
 Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments isbased
 on  its  hedge  designation.  The  following  tables  show  the  Company’s  derivative  instruments  at  gross  fair  value  as  of September  29,  2018 and September 30, 2017

 that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency orinterest
 rates  at  each  respective  date.  The  Company’s  exposure  to  credit  loss  and  market  risk  will  vary  over  time  as  currency  and  interest  rates  change.Although
 the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associatedwith the
 exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments,together with the gains and losses on the unde

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with thesame
 counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received orposted
 when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assetsand
 derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 29, 2018 , the  net cash collateral posted by the Companyrelated
 to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0  billion ,  which was recorded  as other current assets in the CondensedConsolidated
 Balance Sheet. As of September  30, 2017 ,  the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateralsecurity arrangements was 
$35 million , which was recorded as o ther current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Under
 master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactionswith
 a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September  29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 ,  the potential effects of these rights of set-offassociated
 with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.1 billion 
and $1.4 billion , respectively, resulting in n et derivative assets of  $138 million and $32 million , respectively. Accounts Receivable
Trade
Receivables
The
 Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sizedbusinesses
 and  education,  enterprise  and  government  customers.  The  Company  generally  does  not  require  collateral  from  its  customers;  however,  theCompany
 will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limitcredit risk on trade
 receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. Thesecredit-financing

U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On
 December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S.statutory
 federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective  January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreignincome.
 The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The impact of the Act increased the Company’s provision for income taxesby 
$1.5 billion during  2018. This increase was composed of $2.0  billion related  to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and $1.2 billion associated
 with  the  deemed  repatriation  tax,  partially  offset  by  a $1.7  billion impact  the  deemed  repatriation  tax  had  on  the  Company’s  unrecognized  taxbenefits.
Deferred
Tax
Balances
As
 a result of the Act, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the revised rates at which they are expected to reverse,including items
 for which the related income tax effects were originally recognized in OCI. In addition, the Company elected to record certain deferred tax assetsand
 liabilities related to the new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. Of the $2.0 billion recognized  related to the remeasurement of net deferred taxassets
 and liabilities, $1.2 billion is  a provisional estimate that incorporates assumptions based upon the most recent interpretations of the Act and may changeas
 the Company continues to analyze the impact of additional implementation guidance. The Company’s provisional estimates are in accordance with the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission
 Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.Deemed
Repatriation
Tax
As
 of September 30, 2017, the Company had a U.S. deferred tax liability of $36.4 billion for  deferred foreign income. During 2018, the Company replaced $36.1 billion 
of its U.S. deferred  tax liability with a deemed repatriation tax payable of $37.3 billion , which was based on the Company ’s cumulative post-1986 deferredforeign
 income. The deemed repatriation tax payable is a provisional estimate that may change as the Company continues to analyze the impact of additionalimplementation guidance. The Co

As
 of September  29,  2018 ,  the  total  amount  of  gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits  was $9.7  billion ,  of  which $7.4  billion ,  if  recognized,  would  impact  theCompany’s
 effective  tax  rate.  As  of September  30,  2017 ,  the  total  amount  of  gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits  was $8.4  billion ,  of  which $2.5  billion ,  ifrecognized, would have impa
cted the Company’s effective tax rate.The
 aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  is as follows (inmillions):

, the  total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion , respectively. Both the unrecogn ized tax benefitsand
 the  associated  interest  and  penalties  that  are  not  expected  to  result  in  payment  or  receipt  of  cash  within  one  year  are  classified  as  other  non-currentliabilities in the

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. InternalRevenue Service
 (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years prior to 2016 are closed. Tax years subsequent to 2006in
 certain  major  U.S.  states  and  subsequent  to  2007  in  certain  major  foreign  jurisdictions  remain  open,  and  could  be  subject  to  examination  by  the  taxingauthorities.
 The  Company  believes  that  an  adequate  provision  has  been  made  for  any  adjustments  that  may  result  from  tax  examinations.  However,  theoutcome
 of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with itsexpectations,
 the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of resolution and/orclosure
 of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (either by payment,release or a combination of both) 
in the next 12 months by as much as $800 million . European Commission State
 Aid DecisionOn
 August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and2007
 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision orderedIreland
 to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated tobe 
€13.1 billion ,  plus interest of €1.2 billion .  Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that dateforward.
 The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union.Ireland
 has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the StateAid
 Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of September  29, 2018 ,  the entire recoveryamount
 plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. Refer to Note 2, “FinancialInstruments” for more

 stock on a one -for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number of shares available for grantunder
 the plan by two shares. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant underthe
 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividendequivalent
 rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the samevesting and
 other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approvalof the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 
385 million shares plus the number of shares rema ining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Sharessubject
 to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations withrespect to
 RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 29, 2018 , approximately 280.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.
Apple Inc. Non-Employ
ee Director Stock PlanThe
 Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs orstock
 options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board ofDirectors
 and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change thevalue
 and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of theCompany’s
 common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. Eachshare
 issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The DirectorPlan
 expires November  12, 2027 .  All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms andconditions
 as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September  29, 2018 , approximately 1.1 million 
shares were reserved for  future issuance under the Director Plan.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K |

 fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $7.6  billion , $6.1 billion and $5.1 billion for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively. The majority ofRSUs
 that vested in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were  net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’ obligation forthe
 applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately16.0 million 
, 15.4 million and 15.9 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and were based on  the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates asdetermined
 by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $2.7 billion , $2.0 billion and $1.7billion 
in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net sharesettlements
 had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result ofthe vesting and did not represent an expense to the Co

 an  indemnified  third  party.  Except  as  disclosed  under  the  heading  “Contingencies”  below,  in  the  opinion  of  management,  there  was  not  at  least  areasonable possibility the
 Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of thirdparties.
The
 Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China.The
 iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certainconditions
 are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right,with subsequent changes to the guarantee liab
ility recognized within revenue.The
 Company  has  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  its  directors  and  executive  officers.  Under  these  agreements,  the  Company  has  agreed  toindemnify such
 individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, andto
 advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount ofpayments
 the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts andcircumstances
 involved  in  each  claim.  While  the  Company  maintains  directors  and  officers  liability  insurance  coverage,  such  insurance  coverage  may  beinsufficient to cover all losses 
or all types of claims that may arise.Concentrations in the Available Sources of 
Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough
 most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained fromsingle or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the
 markets for mobile communication and mediadevices
 and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at timessubject
 to industry-wide  shortage  and  significant commodity  pricing fluctuations  that  could materially adversely affect  the Company’s  financial condition  andoperating results.
Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 
60 
The  Company  uses  some  custom  components  that  are  not  commonly  used  by  its  competitors,  and  new  products  introduced  by  the  Company  often  utilizecustom
 components  available  from  only  one  source.  When  a  component  or  product  uses  new  technologies,  initial  capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  thesuppliers’
 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed orconstrained,
 or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating resultscould
 be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the timerequired
 to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability ofthese
 components  at  acceptable  prices,  or  at  all,  may  be  affected  if  suppliers  decide  to  concentrate  on  the  production  of  common  components  instead  ofcomponents customized to meet the Compan
y’s requirements.The Company
 has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend orrenew
 these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases thatcould materially adversely affec
t its financial condition and operating results.Substantially
 all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computersmanufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A
 significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often insingle
 locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products.Although
 the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s financial condition and operating results couldbe
 materially  adversely  affected  if  its  outsourcing  partners  were  unable  to  meet  their  production  commitments.  The  Company’s  manufacturing  purchaseobligations typically cover its requirem
ents for periods up to 150 days . Other Off–Balance She

Leases
The
 Company  leases  various  equipment  and  facilities,  including  retail  space,  under  noncancelable  operating  lease  arrangements.  The  Company  does  notcurrently
 utilize any other off–balance sheet financing arrangements. As of September  29, 2018 ,  the Company’s total future minimum lease payments undernoncancelable
 operating leases were $9.6 billion .  The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year re
newal options.Rent expense under all
 operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $1.2 billion , $1.1 billion and $939 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016

ContingenciesThe Company
 is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, asfurther
 discussed  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  this  Form  10-K  under  the  heading  “Risk  Factors”  and  in  Part  I,  Item  3  of  this  Form  10-K  under  the  heading  “LegalProceedings.”
 The  outcome  of  litigation  is  inherently  uncertain.  If  one  or  more  legal  matters  were  resolved  against  the  Company  in  a  reporting  period  foramounts
 in  excess  of  management’s  expectations,  the  Company’s  financial  condition  and  operating  results  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  materiallyadversely
 affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a materialloss in excess of a recorded a
ccrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:VirnetX
VirnetX,
 Inc. filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging thatcertain
 Company  products  infringe  four  patents  (the  “VirnetX  Patents”)  relating  to  network  communications  technology  (“VirnetX  I”  and  “VirnetX  II”).  OnSeptember
 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $302 million ,  which later increased to $440 million in post-trial
 proceedings.  VirnetX  I is currently  on  appeal  at the  U.S. Court of  Appeals  for the  Federal  Circuit (the  “Federal  Circuit”). On April 11,  2018,  a juryreturned
 a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million .  VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company has challenged thevalidity
 of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX hasappealed,
 and those appeals are currently pending at the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit has consolidated the Company’s appeal of the Eastern TexasDistrict Court VirnetX I verdict an
d VirnetX’s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. The Company believes it will prevail on the merits.Qualcomm
On January 20,
 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated and affiliated parties (“Qualcomm”) in the U.S. District Court for the SouthernDistrict
 of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm from requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. As theCompany
 does  not  believe  the  demanded  royalty  it  has  historically  paid  contract  manufacturers  for  each  applicable  device  is  fair,  reasonable  and  non-discriminatory,
 and  believes  it  to  be  invalid  and/or  overstated  in  other  respects  as  well,  no  Qualcomm-related  royalty  payments  have  been  remitted  by  theCompany to its contract manufacture
rs since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. The Company believes it will prevail on the merits of the case and hasaccrued its best estimat
e for the ultimate resolution of this matter.Note 10 – Segment Information and Geog
raphic DataThe
 Company  reports  segment  information  based  on  the  “management”  approach.  The  management  approach  designates  the  internal  reporting  used  bymanagement for making decision
s and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.The
 Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,Japan
 and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East andAfrica.
 Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’sother
 reportable  segments.  Although  the  reportable  segments  provide  similar  hardware  and  software  products  and  similar  services,  each  one  is  managedseparately
 to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.The accounting policies of the va
rious segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based
 on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generallybased
 on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segmentincludes net
 sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally includedin
 the  geographic  segment  in  which  the  expenditures  are  incurred.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  excludes  other  income  and  expense  and  certainexpenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from
 segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research anddevelopment,
 corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separatelymanaged general and administrati
ve costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K |

terial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. We

 shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September  29, 2018 ,  and the related notes and our report datedNovember 5, 2018 
expressed an unqu alified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion
Apple
 Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over
 financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress
 an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required
 to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission
 and the PCAOB.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whe
ther effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our
 audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  andevaluating
 the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considerednecessary in the circum
stances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal 
Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial
 reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe
 transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permitpreparation
 of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company arebeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
 directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention ortimely detection of unauthorized a
cquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness
 to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountan ts on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.
Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and P
roceduresBased
 on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principalfinancial
 officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Actwere
 effective as of September  29, 2018 to  provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files orsubmits
 under  the  Exchange  Act  is  (i)  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and(ii) accumulated and
 communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allowtimely decisions regarding require
d disclosure.Inherent Limitations
 Over Internal ControlsThe
 Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  thepreparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internalcontrol over financial repor
ting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain  to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’sassets;
(ii)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  withGAAP,
 and  that  the  Company’s  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  the  Company’smanagement and directors; and
(iii)
provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assetsthat could have a material effect on the finan
cial statements.Management,
 including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent ordetect
 all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that theobjectives
 of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits ofcontrols
 must  be  considered  relative  to  their  costs.  Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  in  all control  systems,  no  evaluation  of  internal  controls  can  provideabsolute
 assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in futureperiods
 are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.Management’s Annual Report on Inte
rnal Control Over Financial ReportingThe
 Company’s management  is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate  internal control over financial reporting  (as defined  in Rule 13a-15(f)under
 the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on thecriteria
 set  forth  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013framework).
 Based  on  the  Company’s  assessment,  management  has  concluded  that  its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  ofSeptember
 29, 2018 to  provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordancewith
 GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal controlover financial reporting, 
which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial 
ReportingThere

 required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likelyto materially affect, t
he Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Item 9B.

APPLE INC. 2014 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD
1. 
General . These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these “ Terms ”) apply to a particular restricted stock unit award
 (the “ Award ”)  granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “ Company ”),  and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant(the
 “ Grant  Notice ”)  corresponding  to  that  particular  grant.  The  recipient  of  the  Award  identified  in  the  Grant  Notice  is  referred  to  as  the  “Participant 
.”  The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “ Award Date .”  The Award was grantedunder
 and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “ Plan ”).  Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if notdefined herein. The Award has been granted to
 the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable orto be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to as the “ 
Award Agreement ” applicable to the Award. 2. 
     Stock Units . As  used herein, the term “ Stock Unit ” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes
 to be equivalent to one outstanding share of the Company’s Common Stock (“ Share ”)  solely for purposes of the Plan and this AwardAgreement.
 The Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if suchStock Units vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The Stock Units shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.
3. 
     Vesting .  Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Eachvesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “ 
Vesting Date. ”) 4. 
     Continuance of Employment .  Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continuedactive
 employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and therights
 and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Vesting Commencement Dateand
 the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionatevesting
 of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (otherthan
 a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by theCompany, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shal
l be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.Nothing
 contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects theParticipant’s
 status  as an employee at will who is subject  to termination  with or without cause, confers upon the Participant  any right  to remainemployed
 by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time toterminate
 such  employment  or  services,  or  affects  the  right  of  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary  to  increase  or  decrease  the  Participant’s  othercompensation
 or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participantwithout his or her consent thereto.
5. 
     Dividend and Voting Rights . (a) 
         Limitations  on Rights Associated with Stock Units .  The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of theCompany,
 no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, withrespect to the Stock Units or any Shares
1

underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the Participant. No adjustmentswill
 be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate or book entryevidencing such Shares.
(b) 
         Dividend  Equivalent Rights Distributions .  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on itsCommon
 Stock, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on itsCommon
 Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Stock Units (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan)subject
 to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “ Dividend  Equivalent Right ”).  Any DividendEquivalent
 Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms,conditions
 and  restrictions  as  the  original  Stock  Units  to  which  they  relate,  including  the  obligation  to  satisfy  the  Tax-Related  Items;  provided,however,
 that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be madepursuant
 to this Section 5(b) with respect to any Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paidpursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8.
6. 
     Restrictions on Transfer . Except as  provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interesttherein
 or  amount  or  Shares  payable  in  respect  thereof  shall  not  be  sold,  assigned,  transferred,  pledged  or  otherwise  disposed  of,  alienated  orencumbered, either voluntarily or involuntari
ly.7. 
     Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units .  On or as soon as administratively practical following each vesting event pursuantto
 Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such vesting event), the Company shall deliver to theParticipant
 a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, asdetermined
 by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that vest on the applicable Vesting Date, lessTax-Related
 Items (as defined in Section 11 below), unless such Stock Units terminate prior to the given Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. TheCompany’s
 obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that theParticipant
 or  other  person  entitled  under  the  Plan  to  receive  any  Shares  with  respect  to  the  vested  Stock  Units  deliver  to  the  Company  anyrepresentations
 or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights withrespect to any Stock Units that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.
8. 
     Effect of Termination of Service .  Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s Stock Units (as wellas
 the  related  Dividend  Equivalent  Rights)  shall  terminate  to  the  extent  such  Stock  Units  have  not  become  vested  prior  to  the  Participant’sTermination
 of  Service,  meaning  the  first  date  the  Participant  is  no  longer  employed  by  or  providing  services  to  the  Company  or  one  of  itsSubsidiaries
 (the  “ Severance  Date ”),  regardless  of  the  reason  for  the  Participant’s  Termination  of  Service,  whether  with  or  without  cause,voluntarily
 or involuntarily or whether the Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date.Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, in the event the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to the Participant’s Disability at a time when Stock Unitsremain
 outstanding and unvested under the Award, (a) the Award shall vest with respect to the number of Stock Units determined by multiplying (i)the
 number of then-outstanding and unvested Stock Units as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights subject to the Award that would haveotherwise vested pursuant
 to Section 3 on the next Vesting Date following the Severance Date but for such Termination of Service, by (ii) a fraction,the numerator of which
 shall be the number of days that have elapsed between the Vesting Date that immediately preceded the Severance Date (or,in
 the  case  of  a  Termination  of  Service  prior  to  the  initial  Vesting  Date,  the  Vesting  Commencement  Date)  and  the  Severance  Date,  and  thedenominator
 of which shall be  t he number of days between the Vesting Date that immediately preceded the Severance Date (or, in the case of aTermination
 of Service prior to the initial Vesting Date, the Vesting Commencement Date) and the next Vesting Date following the Severance Datethat
 would have occurred but for such Termination of Service; and (b) any Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that arenot vested
2

after giving effect to the foregoing clause (a) shall terminate on the Severance Date. Further, in the event the Participant’s Termination of Service isdue
 to the Participant’s death, any then-outstanding and unvested Stock Units subject to the Award shall be fully vested as of the Severance Date,and any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited to the
 Participant shall be paid. If any unvested Stock Units are terminated hereunder, such Stock Units(as
 well  as  the  related  Dividend  Equivalent  Rights)  shall  automatically  terminate  and  be  cancelled  as  of  the  applicable  Severance  Date  withoutpayment
 of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant or the Participant’s personal representative, as thecase may be.
9. 
     Recoupment . Notwithstanding any other  provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued,delivered
 or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any suchShares or
 property, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company may require theParticipant
 to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued, delivered orpaid
 in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such Shares orproperty, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following h
as occurred:(a)
during the peri od of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “ Employment Period ”),
 the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offenseunder the applicable laws of any rel
evant foreign jurisdiction);(b)
during  the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of confidentiality, oran
 unauthorized  disclosure  or  use  of  inside  information,  customer  lists,  trade  secrets  or  other  confidential  information  of  theCompany or any of its Subsidiaries;
(c)
during the  Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft, embezzlementor fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Comp
any or any of its Subsidiaries.For purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and exp
licitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant’s behalf, toany brokerage firm and/or third party administrator engaged by the Company to hol
d the Participant’s Shares and other amounts acquired under thePlan to re-convey, transfer or otherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the Comp
any’s exclusiveremedy with respect to such matters.
10. 
     Adjustments Upon Specified Events .  Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company’s stock contemplated bySection
 11  of  the  Plan  (including,  without  limitation,  an  extraordinary  cash  dividend  on  such  stock),  the  Committee  shall  make  adjustments  inaccordance
 with such section in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect ofthe Award. No such adjustment
 shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuantto Section 5(b).
11. 
     Responsibility  for Taxes .  The  Participant  acknowledges  that,  regardless  of  any  action  the  Company  and/or  the  Participant’semployer
 (the “ Employer ”)  take  with  respect  to  any  or  all  income  tax  (including  U.S.  federal,  state  and  local  tax  and/or  non-U.S.  tax),  socialinsurance, payroll tax, payment on account
 or other tax-related items related to the Participant’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to theParticipant or deemed by the Company
 or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to the Participant even if technically due by the Company or theEmployer
 (“ Tax-Related  Items ”),  the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s responsibility and may exceed theamount,
 if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer(i)
 make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, includingthe grant of the Stock Units, the vesting of the Stock
3

Units, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend EquivalentRights; and (ii) do not
 commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate theParticipant’s
 liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more thanone
 jurisdiction,  the  Participant  acknowledges  that  the  Company  and/or  the  Employer  (or  former  employer,  as  applicable)  may  be  required  towithhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdictio
n.Prior
 to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory tothe
 Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, ortheir
 respective  agents,  at  their  discretion  and  pursuant  to  such  procedures  as  they  may  specify  from  time  to  time,  to  satisfy  any  applicablewithholding oblig
ations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:(a)     
withholding from any wages or other cash compensati on payable to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer;(b)     
withholding otherwise de liverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid uponvesting/settlement of the Award;
(c) 
    arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’sdirection pursuant to this authorization), includi
ng selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan; or(d)     
withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acqu ired upon vesting/settlement of the Award.Notwithsta
nding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, thenthe
 Company  must  satisfy  any  withholding  obligations  arising  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  taxable  or  tax  withholding  event,  as  applicable,by
 withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant tomethod
 (b),  unless  the  Board  or  the  Committee  determines  in  its  discretion  to  satisfy  the  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  one  or  acombination of methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.
Depending
 on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimumstatutory
 withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in the Participant’s jurisdiction(s).  If themaximum
 rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded to the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement tothe equivalent in
 Common Stock) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. If the obligation for Tax-RelatedItems
 is satisfied by withholding a number of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the fullnumber
 of Shares subject to the vested Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying theTax-Related
 Items. The Participant shall pay to the Company and/or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company and/or theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Participant’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the meanspreviously
 described.  The  Company  may  refuse  to  issue  or  deliver  to  the  Participant  any  Shares  or  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  Shares  if  theParticipant fails to comply with the Participant’s obli
gations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.12.

5.      Dividend and Voting Rights . (a) 
         Limitations  on Rights Associated with Stock Units .  The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of theCompany,
 no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, withrespect
 to the Stock Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such Shares are actually issued to and held ofrecord
 by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date ofissuance of the stock certificate or book entry evidencing such Shares.
(b) 
         Dividend  Equivalent Rights Distributions .  As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on itsCommon
 Stock, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on itsCommon
 Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of Stock Units (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of thePlan)
 subject  to  the  Award  that  are  outstanding  immediately  prior  to  the  record  date  for  that  dividend  (a  “ Dividend  Equivalent  Right ”).  AnyDividend Equivale
nt Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and otherterms,
 conditions and restrictions as the original Stock Units to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided,however,
 that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the DividendEquival
ent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total target number of Stock Units that vest on the Vesting Date, after givingeffect
 to Exhibit  A .  No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any Stock Units which,immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been pa
id pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A . 6. 
     Restrictions on Transfer . Except as  provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interesttherein
 or  amount  or  Shares  payable  in  respect  thereof  shall  not  be  sold,  assigned,  transferred,  pledged  or  otherwise  disposed  of,  alienated  orencumbered, either voluntarily or involuntari
ly.7. 
     Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units .  On or as soon as administratively practical following the vesting event pursuant toSection
 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such vesting event), the Company shall deliver to theParticipant
 a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, asdetermined
 by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, less Tax-Related
 Items (as defined in Section 11 below), unless such Stock Units terminate prior to the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’sobligation
 to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that the Participantor
 other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested Stock Units deliver to the Company any representations orother documents
 or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any StockUnits that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.
8. 
     Effect of Termination of Service .  Except as provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s Stock Units (as well as therelated
 Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such Stock Units have not become vested prior to the Participant’s Termination ofService,
 meaning  the  first  date  the  Participant  is  no  longer  employed  by  or  providing  services  to  the  Company  or  one  of  its  Subsidiaries  (the  “Severance Date 
”), regardless of  the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily orwhether
 the Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date. In the event the Participant’sSeverance
 Date is the result of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s death or Disability, and the Severance Date occursprior
 to the Vesting Date, on the Vesting Date the Award shall vest with respect to a number of Stock Units determined by multiplying (i) the StockUnits
 as  well  as  the  related  Dividend  Equivalent  Rights  subject  to  the  Award  that  would  have  otherwise  vested  pursuant  to  the  Award  on  suchVesting Date but for the Termination of Service and to the extent the applica
ble performance-based vesting requirement2

is satisfied, by (ii) the Severance Fraction (determined as set forth below). Any Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) thatare
 unvested on the Severance Date and that are not eligible to vest on the Vesting Date following the Severance Date pursuant to the precedingsentence
 shall terminate as of the Severance Date, and any Stock Units that remain outstanding and unvested after giving effect to the precedingsentence
 shall terminate as of the Vesting Date. The “ Severance  Fraction ”  means a fraction, the numerator of which shall be determined bysubtracting
 the number of days remaining in the Performance Period on the Severance Date from the total number of days in the PerformancePeriod,
 and the denominator of which shall be the total  number of days in the Performance  Period. If  any unvested Stock Units are terminatedpursuant
 to  this  Award  Agreement,  such  Stock  Units  (as  well  as  the  related  Dividend  Equivalent  Rights)  shall  automatically  terminate  and  becancelled
 as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied, the VestingDate,
 as provided  in Exhibit  A )  without  payment  of  any  consideration  by  the  Company  and  without  any  other  action  by  the  Participant,  or  theParticipant’s beneficiary or personal represe
ntative, as the case may be.9. 
     Recoupment .  Notwithstanding  any other  provision  herein,  the Award and any Shares or other  amount  or property  that  may beissued,
 delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of anysuch
 Shares  or  property,  shall  be  subject  to  any  recoupment,  “clawback”  or  similar  provisions  of  applicable  law.  In  addition,  the  Company  mayrequire
 the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued,delivered
 or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any suchShares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the followin
g has occurred:(a)
during the peri od of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “ Employment Period ”),
 the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offenseunder the applicable laws of any rel
evant foreign jurisdiction);(b)
during  the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of confidentiality, oran
 unauthorized  disclosure  or  use  of  inside  information,  customer  lists,  trade  secrets  or  other  confidential  information  of  theCompany or any of its Subsidiaries;
(c)
during the  Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft, embezzlementor fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Comp
any or any of its Subsidiaries.For
 purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant’s behalf, toany brokerage firm
 and/or third party administrator engaged by the Company to hold the Participant’s Shares and other amounts acquired under thePlan
 to re-convey, transfer or otherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the Company’s exclusiveremedy with respect to such matters.
10. 
     Adjustments Upon Specified Events .  Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company’s stock contemplated bySection
 11  of  the  Plan  (including,  without  limitation,  an  extraordinary  cash  dividend  on  such  stock),  the  Committee  shall  make  adjustments  inaccordance
 with such section in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect ofthe Award. No such adjustment
 shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited pursuantto Section 5(b).
11. 
     Responsibility  for Taxes .  The  Participant  acknowledges  that,  regardless  of  any  action  the  Company  and/or  the  Participant’semployer
 (the “ Employer ”)  take  with  respect  to  any  or  all  income  tax  (including  U.S.  federal,  state  and  local  tax  and/or  non-U.S.  tax),  socialinsurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant’s p
articipation in the Plan and legally applicable3

to the Participant or deemed by the Company or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to the Participant even if technically due by the Companyor
 the  Employer  (“ Tax-Related  Items ”),  the  ultimate  liability  for  all  Tax-Related  Items  is  and  remains  the  Participant’s  responsibility  and  mayexceed
 the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or theEmployer (i) make no
 representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award,including
 the grant of the Stock Units, the vesting of the Stock Units, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vestingand
 the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms ofthe
 grant  or  any  aspect  of  the  Award  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  Participant’s  liability  for  Tax-Related  Items  or  achieve  any  particular  tax  result.Further,
 if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or theEmployer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or acco
unt for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.Prior
 to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory tothe
 Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, ortheir
 respective  agents,  at  their  discretion  and  pursuant  to  such  procedures  as  they  may  specify  from  time  to  time,  to  satisfy  any  applicablewithholding oblig
ations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:(a)     
withholding from any wages or other cash compensati on payable to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer;(b)     
withholding otherwise de liverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid uponvesting/settlement of the Award;
(c) 
    arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’sdirection pursuant to this authorization), includi
ng selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan; or(d)     
withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acqu ired upon vesting/settlement of the Award.Notwithsta
nding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, thenthe
 Company  must  satisfy  any  withholding  obligations  arising  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  taxable  or  tax  withholding  event,  as  applicable,by
 withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant tomethod
 (b),  unless  the  Board  or  the  Committee  determines  in  its  discretion  to  satisfy  the  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  one  or  acombination of methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.
Depending
 on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimumstatutory
 withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in the Participant's jurisdictions(s).  If themaximum
 rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded to the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement tothe equivalent in
 Common Stock) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. If the obligation for Tax-RelatedItems
 is satisfied by withholding a number of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the fullnumber
 of Shares subject to the vested Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying theTax-Related
 Items. The Participant shall pay to the Company and/or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company and/or theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Participant’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the meanspreviously
 described.  The  Company  may  refuse  to  issue  or  deliver  to  the  Participant  any  Shares  or  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  Shares  if  theParticipant fails to comply with the Participant’s obli
gations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.4

PERFORMANCE AWARDEXHIBIT A
PERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS
The
 Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined basedon the Company’s relative total sharehold
er return (“ TSR ”) Percentile for the Performance Period. The percentage of the Stock Units (and related Divide
nd Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting Date will be determined as follows:•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile or greater, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Unitswill vest on the Vesting Date.
•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will veston the Vesting Date.
•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will veston the Vesting Date.
•
If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the Stock Units will vest onthe Vesting Date.
For TSR
 Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, the portion of the Stock Units that will veston
 the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis ( i.e.
 , linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicatedabove.
Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, if the Company’s TSR for the Performance  Period is negative, in no event shall more than one hundredpercent (100%) of the target Stock Units vest.
The
 number of Stock Units that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and the balance of the Stock Units willnot vest and will terminate on that Vesting Date.
For purposes of the Award, the following definitio
ns will apply:•
“ TSR Percentile ”  means the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs for the Comparison Group members forthe
 Performance  Period.  In  determining  the  Company’s  TSR  Percentile  for  the  Performance  Period,  in  the  event  that  theCompany’
s TSR for the Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other Comparison Group members for that sameperiod,
 the Company’s TSR Percentile ranking will be determined by ranking the Company’s TSR for that period as being greaterthan such other Comparison Group members.
•
“ Comparison Group ”  means the Company and each other company included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index on the first dayof
 the Performance Period and, except as provided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of which continues to belisted or
 traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event a member ofthe
 Comparison  Group  files  for  bankruptcy  or  liquidates  due  to  an  insolvency,  such  company  shall  continue  to  be  treated  as  aCompariso
n Group member, and such company’s Ending Price will be treated as $0 if the common stock (or similar equity security)of such company is no longer listed or traded on a nation
al securitiesA-1

exchange on the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event of a formation of a new parent company by a ComparisonGroup member,
 substantially all of the assets and liabilities of which consist immediately after the transaction of the equity interestsin
 the original Comparison Group member or the assets and liabilities of such Comparison Group member immediately prior to thetransactio
n, such new parent company shall be substituted for the Comparison Group member to the extent (and for such period oftime)
 as its common stock (or similar equity securities) are listed or traded on a national securities exchange but the common stock(or
 similar  equity  securities)  of  the  original  Comparison  Group  member  are  not.  In  the  event  of  a  merger  or  other  businesscombination of two Comparison G
roup members (including, without limitation, the acquisition of one Comparison Group member, orall or
 substantially all of its assets, by another Comparison Group member), the surviving, resulting or successor entity, as the casemay
 be, shall continue to be treated as a member of the Comparison Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equitysecurity)
 of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period.With
 respect  to  the  preceding  two  sentences,  the  applicable  stock  prices  shall  be  equitably  and  proportionately  adjusted  to  theextent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitig
ate the impact of the transaction.•
“ TSR ”  shall be determined with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group member by dividing: (a) the sum of (i)the
 difference obtained by subtracting the applicable Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price plus (ii) all dividends andother
 distributions during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. Any non-cash distributions shall be valuedat
 fair market value. For the purpose of determining TSR, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined bytreating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closin
g market price on the date of distribution.•
“ Beginning Price ”  means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group member, the average of the closingmarket
 prices  of  such  company’s  common  stock  on  the  principal  exchange  on  which  such  stock  is  traded  for  the  twenty  (20)consecutive
 trading days beginning with the first trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining BeginningPrice, the
 value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stockat the closing market price on the date of distribution.
•
“ Ending  Price ”  means,  with  respect  to  the  Company  and  any  other  Comparison  Group  member,  the  average  of  the  closingmarket
 prices  of  such  company’s  common  stock  on  the  principal  exchange  on  which  such  stock  is  traded  for  the  twenty  (20)consecutive
 trading days ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining Ending Price,the
 value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at theclosing market price on the date of distribution.
With
 respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be an equitable and proportionate adjustmentto
 the  extent  (if  any)  necessary  to  preserve  the  intended  incentives  of  the  awards  and  mitigate  the  impact  of  any  stock  split,  stock  dividend  orreverse
 stock split occurring during the Performance Period (or during the applicable 20-day period in determining Beginning Price or Ending Price,as the case may be).
In the event of any ambiguity or discrepancy, the determination of the Committee shall be fin
al and binding.* * * * *
