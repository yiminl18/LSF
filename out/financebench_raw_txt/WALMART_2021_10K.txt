ry day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become digital, and make trust a competitive advantage.Making life easier fo
r busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well asincreasing convenience 
to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of qualitymerchandise and servic
es at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customerstrust that our prices wil
l not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savingscan be passed along to our custom
ers.Our operations comprise thr
ee reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States("U.S.") and Canadian operations. We conso
lidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and forthe fiscal years ended J
anuary 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021"), January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020") and January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019"). During fiscal 2021, we generatedtotal revenues of $559.2 bill
ion, which was primarily comprised of net sales of $555.2 billion.We maintain our princ
ipal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT."The Development of Our Company
The businesses conducted by our founders b
egan in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, hisbrother, James L. Walton, open
ed a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores.In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we open
ed our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, webegan our first interna
tional initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2021, our Walmart International segment conductedbusiness in 25 countries.
In 2000, we began our first eCommer
ce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In2007, leveraging our physical sto
res, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise instores. To date, we now have approxima
tely 7,300 pickup and 5,200 delivery locations globally. In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel andeCommerce innovation, as wel
l as made several eCommerce acquisitions to better serve our customers. These investments have enabled us to leverage technology,talent and expertise, 
incubate digitally-native brands, and expand our assortment and service offerings in stores and on walmart.com. We have also continued toenhance our eCommerce in
itiatives internationally, such as with our acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart"), which is our ecosystemin India that includes eCom
merce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.In fiscal 2021, we launched Wa
lmart+ in the U.S., a new membership offering with omni-channel shopping benefits that currently include unlimited free shippingon eligible items with no ord
er minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, and mobile scan & go for a streamlined in-store shopping experience. Weare enhancing our ecosyste
m with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites and supply chain combined with our more than 2.3 millionassociates as of January 31, 2021 to b
etter serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates customer relationshipswhere customers view Walm
art as their primary destination.During fiscal 2021, the world has been, 
and continues to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have incurred incremental costs associated withoperating during a global he
alth crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated our business growth and eCommerce expansion. We have continued to investin our omni-channel offe
ring which resonates with customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.6

aintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes tothe contribution rate 
for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments andgeographic and product infor
mation is contained in Note 13  to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements.Walmart U.S. Segment

respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("grossprofit rate"). In addi
tion, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.Omni-channel.

ll," "Athletic Works," "Bonobos," "Eloquii,"(1)7

clude: "Better Homes & Gardens," "Farberware," "Pioneer Woman" and "Russell."Periodically, revisions a
re made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previousperiods' presentation is ad
justed to maintain comparability.Operations.
 Historically, many superc enters, discount stores and neighborhood markets were generally open 24 hours each day. In response to the COVID-19pandemic, we reduced store hou
rs to allow for additional cleaning and sanitizing but expanded store hours slightly toward the end of fiscal 2021. Consistent withits strategy, Walma
rt U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services that help better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such aspickup and delivery, Walm
art+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.Seasonal Aspects of Operations.
 Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well asdifferent weather pa
tterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. However, theCOVID-19 pandemic may have an impac
t on consumer behaviors that could result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business.Competition.
 Walmart U.S. competes with omn i-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialtystores, supermarkets, hyper
markets and supercenter-type stores, as well as eCommerce retailers. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations andto deliver a customer-centric om
ni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designedto meet competitiv
e pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:•
EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequentpromotional activity;
•
EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; and•
Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our new Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to servecustomers in the ways they want to b
e served.Distribution.
 For fiscal 2021, the majori ty of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our 156 distribution facilities, which arelocated strategic
ally throughout the U.S. The remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and drygrocery merchandise is 
transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of ourperishable grocery me
rchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locationsincluding from our 32 dedica
ted eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship directly from approximately 3,000 stores.Walmart International Segment
Walmart Interna
tional is our second largest segment and operated in 25 countries outside of the U.S as of January 31, 2021. Walmart International operatedthrough our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Can
ada, Chile, and China, as well as our businesses classified as held for sale in Japan and the United Kingdom as ofJanuary 31, 2021. Walmart Int
ernational also operates through our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho,Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nig
eria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador,Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragu
a), India and Mexico. Walmart International previously operated in Argentina and Brazil prior to the sale of Walmart Argentinain fiscal 2021 and the majo
rity stake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12  for discussion of recent divestitures.Walmart International includes n
umerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats,including: supercenters, sup
ermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx,walmart.ca, flipkar
t.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $121.4 billion for fiscal 2021, representing 22% of our fiscal 2021 consolidated netsales, and had net sales of $120.1 bi
llion and $120.8 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The segment's net sales were negatively impacted by currencyexchange rate fluctu
ations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.8

Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of themarkets it operates. 
We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainableand profitable growth. As such, we have t
aken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include thefollowing highlights over the l
ast three years:•
Acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018.•
Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil in August 2018. •
Divestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019.•
Divestiture of Walmart Argentina in November 2020.•
Divestiture of Asda Group Limited ("Asda”), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021.•
Divestiture of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.Omni-channel.
 Walmart Interna tional provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup anddelivery services in mos
t of our markets, our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe inIndia. In China, our partnerships wi
th JD.com and JD Daojia provide customers one-hour delivery by leveraging Walmart stores as fulfillment centers.Generally, retail uni
ts' selling area range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling area generally range in size from24,000 square feet to 156,000 square f
eet. As of January 31, 2021, Walmart International had approximately 3,000 pickup and 2,200 delivery locations.Merchandise.
 The merchandising strat egy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope ofmerchandise offered 
for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developedmarket specific pr
ivate brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate,""George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "M
ainstays," "Marketside" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brandsincluding "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "L
ider," "Myntra," and "PhonePe." In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional andlocal suppliers in each 
market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.Walmart Interna
tional also offers fuel, financial services and related products in various markets. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaidcards and money (wire) tr
ansfers, and our PhonePe business in India provides a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment,investment and insurance so
lutions, financial services and advertising. Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segmentrevenues.
Operations.
 The hours of operation for oper ating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon localand national ordinances gove
rning hours of operation. Toward the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, government mandates led to extensive store andoperational closures in 
several of our international markets as well as limitations on certain merchandise sales in select markets. While most closed stores andwarehouses resumed operations by 
the end of fiscal 2021, store hours have been partially reduced or modified in several markets. Additionally, several marketsimplemented enhanced s
afety and sanitization protocols, as well as provided increased customer options and capacity for pickup and delivery services.Seasonal Aspects of Operations.
 Walmart Interna tional's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, its highest sales volume and operating income haveoccurred in the fourth qua
rter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals andcustoms, as well as differ
ent weather patterns. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors that could result in temporarychanges in the seasonal flu
ctuations of our business.Competition.
 Walmart Interna tional competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets,hypermarkets and supercen
ter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores,and eCommerce retai
lers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determi
nes our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model andwe continue to focus on moving our ma
rkets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impacton our competitive position

ing the pandemic, Curbside Pickup was launched at all clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members. Sam's Club also offers "Scan & Go," a mobile 
checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line.10

Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a ce rtain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well asdifferent weather pa
tterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may havean impact on consumer behav
iors that could result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business.Competition.
 Sam's Club competes with other me mbership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail andwholesale grocers, genera
l merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. AtSam's Club, we provide value at memb
ers-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. OureCommerce website and m
obile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete and recently enabled the launch ofCurbside Pickup across all clubs.
Distribution.
 During fiscal 2021, the major ity of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from Sam's Club's 27 dedicated distribution facilities, locatedstrategically throughou
t the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items.Suppliers shipped the remaind
er of the Sam's Club segment's club purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased onsamsclub.com and through its mob
ile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 11 dedicated eCommercefulfillment centers and other 
distribution centers.Sam's Club uses a combination of our pr
ivate truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.The segment contracts 
with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual propertyas important to our success, 
and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, andconfidentiality and/o
r license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and internationaldomain names, tradema
rks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietarytechnology. We have licens
ed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.Suppliers and Supply Chain
As a retailer and warehouse 
club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase themerchandise that we sel
l in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in whichsuch merchandise will be sold, p
articularly products in the "fresh" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of the annual sales for a numberof our suppliers, and the volume o
f product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject tostandards of conduct, including 
requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquirefrom our suppliers the assor
tment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supplychain and to distribute thos
e products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of ourmerchandise assortmen
t we offer to our customers and members.Government Regulation
As a company with global operations, we 
are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules andregulations of various govern
ing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in "Item 1A .  Risk Factors" under the sub-caption “Lega
l, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks".11

Human Capital ManagementOur commitment to help peop
le around the world save money and live better is delivered by our associates who make the difference for our customers every day.As of the end of fiscal 2021, we employ
ed more than 2.3 million associates worldwide, with 1.6 million associates in the U.S. and 0.7 million associatesinternationally. In th
e U.S., approximately 94% of these associates are hourly and approximately 64% are full-time.We believe the streng
th of our workforce is a significant contributor to our success. Walmart is a place of opportunity, not only as a foundational entry point todevelop critical ski
lls that are relevant for a variety of careers, but also a place where people can grow in their careers across our global omni-channel business. Ascustomer demands and techno
logy change the nature of work, we need to attract, develop and retain associates to thrive in an ever-changing omni-channelenvironment. Approximately 75
% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly positions. We believe our focus onimproving career paths 
for our associates through robust training, competitive wages, new ways of working, and opportunities for advancement has improvedturnover in the U.S. over the past f
ew years.Our workforce strategy includ
es the following strategic priorities:Inclusion
 - Build a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where associates' ideas and opinions matter. We are focused on crea ting aninclusive culture and a d
iverse associate base, where all associates believe they belong and are empowered to be themselves, which we believe is important inserving our customers now and in the 
future. Management provides recurring culture, diversity, equity and inclusion updates to senior leadership, including ourPresident and CEO, and the Compensation, Manag
ement and Development Committee of the Board of Directors. Of the more than 2.3 million associates employedworldwide, 54% identify as women. In th
e U.S., 47% of the 1.6 million associates identify as ethnically diverse.We review our processe
s regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices. We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewardedbased on meaningful facto
rs such as qualifications, experience, performance and the type of work they do.To build a company where associa
tes feel valued and heard, we gather and respond to associates’ feedback in a variety of ways, including but not limited to ananonymous, periodic, formal, 
associate engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one interactions. Management reviews the results of feedbackobtained from our forma
l associate engagement survey. Feedback and suggestions received through these channels have led to meaningful changes in our business,including a new U.S. attendance poli
cy, for example.Well-being
 - Focus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates. We invest in our associat es by offering competitive wages includingbonuses based on Company performance, 
as well as a broad range of benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements and believethese investments in o
ur associates are important to our future. In the U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our full-time and eligible part-timeassociates, as well as Company pa
id benefits such as a store discount card or Sam's Club membership, 401(k) match, maternity leave, a paid parental leaveprogram to all full-
time associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance and behavioral health services. Certain information relatingto retirement-related benefits we 
provide to our associates is included in Note 11  to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements.In fiscal 2021, we added incre
mental benefits to support associate health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. We provided extra pay and benefits,including special cash bonuses 
totaling $1.6 billion, and the introduction of the COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy in the U.S. See "COVID-19 Updates " in Management's Discussion and Analysis fo
r additional information regarding our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Growth
 - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with new skills. To help associates acquire the experiences and skil
ls needed for success in the jobs of today and tomorrow, we have invested in their development – including new roles and career paths,cross-training, on-the-
job coaching, and formal, classroom-style training such as Walmart Academy in the U.S. We also provide access to educationalopportunities for our elig
ible associates through our Live Better U program, which provides a pathway to earn a high school diploma at no cost or a college degreefor $1 a day, as well as multip
le digital learning opportunities.Digital
 - Accelerate digital transformation and ways of working to improve the associate experience and drive business results. To deliver a seamless cus tomerand associate experien

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS The risks described below could, in ways we 
may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations,financial position and l
iquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.The following risk factors do not 
identify all risks that we may face.Strategic Risks
Failure to successfully execute our o
mni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affectour market position, net sales and financial performanc
e.The retail business continu
es to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures withretailers and wholesal
e clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate.Our strategy, which includes inves
tments in eCommerce, technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may notadequately or effec
tively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position orotherwise offset the imp
act on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in largemeasure on our ability to 
continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and is further subject to the relatedrisks discussed in this 
Item 1A . Failure to successf ully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance whichcould also result in impa
irment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasingonline grocery sales, could 
result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store orcross-club sales of mercha
ndise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financialperformance.
Furthermore, the cost of c
ertain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performancein the short-term and failure
 to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.If we do not timely identify or eff
ectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.
It is difficult to pr
edict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success ofour business depends in part on how accur
ately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing productsand the competitive env
ironment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are ofprimary importance to customer
s and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and thechoices available to 
consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including thoserelated to sustainabi
lity) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferencesand shopping patterns could negat
ively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, ourmarket share and the growth o
f our business.14

We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Each of our segments compet
es for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many otherlocal, regional, national a
nd global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries.We compete in a vari
ety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers,location, store hours, in-sto
re amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digitalplatforms, cost and speed of 
and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integrationof our physical and digital op
erations.A failure to respond
 effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materiallyadversely affect our financial 
performance. See "Item 1. Business " above for additional discuss ion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.Certain segments of the r
etail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors.Such consolidation, or other business 
combinations or alliances, or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources,improved access to mer
chandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such businesscombinations or allian
ces could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies,which could adversel
y affect our financial performance.General or macro-economi
c factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.General economic conditio
ns and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.Higher interest rates, 
lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and otherenergy, weakness in the housing mark
et, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels ofunemployment, decreases 
in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending andshopping patterns, fluctuat
ions in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, otherregulatory changes, the
 imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economicslowdown or recession and other econom
ic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for theproducts we sell in the U.S. or such other 
markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionarypurchases of goods, adversely af
fect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adverselyaffect our operations 
and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.In addition, the economic 
factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costsor commodity prices, and oth
er economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, generaland administrative expense
s and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.The economic factors th
at affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of thegoods we sell to our customers or, in 
more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.The performance of strategic al
liances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect ourfinancial performance.
We may enter into str
ategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand ourbusiness. These arrangements 
may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our businessand competitive position 
relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with astrategic alliance, business
 relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.15

Operational RisksThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position and results of operations is in many r
espects unpredictable, and we may beunable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future.
The continuing impacts of th
e COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile, with varying impacts on certain business operations, demand for ourproducts and services, in-sto
ck positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposureto litigation, and our fin
ancial performance, among other things.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widesp
read and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our domestic and international associates, members,suppliers and other people and 
entities with which we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue tospread and the extent and dur
ation of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business andgovernment shutdowns and other rest
rictions on retailers.Customer demand for cert
ain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer behaviors have changed, which has challenged our abilityto anticipate and/or 
adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors have resulted in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delaysin delivering those products, 
and could impact inventory levels in the future.Other factors and uncert
ainties include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikesin the number of COVID-19 cases, future 
mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we operate; further increased operational costs associated withoperating during a global pand
emic; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures;unknown consequences on our business perform
ance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemicresponse; the availabi
lity of, and prevalence of access to, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19; the pace of recovery when the pandemicsubsides; and the long-term 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult topredict and could otherwise d
isrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance.The COVID-19 pandemic has led to incre
ased revenue growth relative to historic trends, and has particularly accelerated our eCommerce growth. These results, aswell as those of other met
rics such as net income and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future periods. Once the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic subsides, particula
rly as vaccines become more widely available, and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subjectto the aforementioned 
containment directives and similar mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities may result in declining revenueand future operating resu
lts may fall below expectations.To the extent that the COVID-19 pandem
ic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, it may also heighten other risks described in thissection, including b
ut not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives,cybersecurity threa
ts, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatoryrequirements.
Natural disasters, climate change, geopoli
tical events, global health epidemics or pandemics and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect ourfinancial performance.
The occurrence of one or mo
re natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditionssuch as major or extended wint
er storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical events; global health epidemicsor pandemics or other cont
agious outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or otheracts of violence, includ
ing active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliersare located, could adversel
y affect our operations and financial performance.Such events could result in physic
al damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution orfulfillment cent
ers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach orhave transportation to our s
tores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution andfulfillment centers are located, the
 unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including thefrequency of visits by consume
rs to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise)and in consumers' disposable inco
me, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goodsfrom overseas, the disrupt
ion or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, thereduction in the avail
ability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and the disruption in our communicationswith our stores.
16

Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) or transition risks(such as regulatory or te
chnology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes over time could affect, for example, the availabilityand cost of certain consum
er products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure those certain goods or servicesrequired for the opera
tion of our business at the quantities and levels we require.We bear the risk of losses 
incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage ofinventory and business interrup
tion caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areasin which they occur
 and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adverse
ly affect our financial performance.The products we sell are sourc
ed from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an importantfactor in our financi
al performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, andto otherwise meet our requ
ired supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timelyand efficient manne
r and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside theU.S.
Political and economic 
instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located(such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the 
financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards(including our responsible sour
cing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers,merchandise safety and qu
ality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and otherfacilities, includ
ing as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate,currency exchange rat
es, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they arelocated are beyond our cont
rol.In addition, the U.S. foreign trad
e policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitationon the importation of ce
rtain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond ourcontrol. These and other fa
ctors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.If the products we sell are not safe or otherwis
e fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries sufferedby customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise exper
ience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. Weare also subject to reputational and other risks re
lated to third-party sales on our digital platforms.Our customers count on us to provide th
em with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers orthat we prepare and then se
ll could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food andnon-food needs, even if the basis 
for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly toreestablish and such products 
also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items wesell, regardless of the 
cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digitalplatforms, which we refer 
to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to such sales apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes couldexpose us to loss of sales, reduct
ion in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks,including liability, fo
r third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law. Although we impose contractualterms on sellers that 
are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches ofsuch agreements. Any of these ev
ents could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommercegrowth strategy.
We rely extensively on informat
ion systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harmour ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual 
transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems.Our information systems ar
e subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, othermalicious computer programs
, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from cyberattackers and sophisticated organizations includingnation states), catas
trophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systemsare essential to our busin
ess operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores andclubs and our online operations. Our 
information systems are not17

fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we mayhave to make a signific
ant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our businessoperations in the inter
im. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, weare constantly updating our 
information technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes areundertaken. If we fail to 
timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefitsanticipated to be derived fr
om these initiatives.If the technology-based systems that give our custom
ers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as ourability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materia
lly adversely affected.Increasingly, customers 
are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use socialmedia, online advertis
ing, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel salesstrategy, we offer various p
ickup, delivery and shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by thecustomer or member a
t a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is arapidly evolving part of th
e retail industry and of our operations around the world. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations whileadjusting for technology inves
tments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shoppingexperience across al
l channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wideassortment of merchand
ise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of onlineshoppers and developments in onlin
e and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss ofeCommerce and other sal
es, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have amaterial adverse 
impact on our business and results of operations.Our digital platforms, which 
are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run,including those applicat
ions and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gainunauthorized access to 
our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members'information including pay
ment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A . Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse and/or loss,may also create deni
als of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers'and members' shopping experien
ce, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain thesecurity of our digital p
latforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputationaldamage and deteriora
tion of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information isunlawfully obtained and misused, 
any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution ofour strategy for the growth of ou
r business.Any failure to maintain the security of the 
information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result ofcybersecurity attacks on our information syst
ems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause usto incur substantial additional costs, and materially advers
ely affect our business and operating results.Like most retailers, we 
receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personalinformation concerning ou
r associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-partyservice providers for a v
ariety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-officesupport, and other functions. Such provid
ers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, oureCommerce operations dep
end upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.Cyber threats are rapid
ly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasinglysophisticated. Cyber threa
ts and cyberattackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide rangeof motives and expertise. 
We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including byperpetrators of random o
r targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software andattempts to misappropr
iate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. The increased use ofremote work infrastruc
ture due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Some of our systems and third-party service providers'systems have experienced 
limited security breaches or incidents and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be noassurance of a simila
r result in the future.18

Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or ourthird-party service p
roviders' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may haveinherent vulnerabilities or 
defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that couldcompromise informat
ion security.Any compromise of our data secu
rity systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained,damaged, disclosed, destroyed, 
modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition,remediation expenses, and 
claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of whichcould materially and 
adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorizedaccess, disable or degrad
e service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipatethese techniques or to imp
lement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability orcompromise of informa
tion for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our orone of our third-party serv
ice provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may bematerially adversely affected by claim
s from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.Our compliance programs, in
formation technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk. Disruptions in our systems caused bysecurity breaches or cyb
erattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with – could harm our ability to conduct our operations, which may have amaterial effe
ct on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effectthat adversely impac
ts our partners, third-party service providers, customers, financial services firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regularbasis.
In addition, such security-
related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates,vendors and shareholders, could ha
rm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction inour net sales in our eCommer
ce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financialposition, cash flows and liquidity. Such 
events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial positionand performance and could 
result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered byour insurance policies. Mor
eover, a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address theproblems created by the 
issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidentialinformation against cyb
erattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations,particularly our digi
tal operations.We accept payments using 
a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offernew payment options over time, whi
ch may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subjectto various industry data prot
ection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data SecurityStandard. We cannot be cer
tain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detectcyberattacks, cybert
errorism, security breaches or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future. Incertain circumst
ances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover)generally require us to 
adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection withpayment cards and payment 
card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial.Additionally, we offer money (wi
re) transfer services, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders and check cashing and we sell prepaid cards and giftcards. We further off
er co-branded credit cards and installment loans through financial services partners. These products and services require us to comply withlegal and regulatory r
equirements, including global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumerfinancial laws and regul
ations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.The Company also has compliance ob
ligations associated with new privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure andtransfer of personal in
formation, which include statutory liability for security breaches. Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subjectus to fines, sanctions and other 
legal liability and harm our reputation.19

Changes in the results of our health and wellness business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Walmart has reta
il pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, as well as the recent addition of Walmart Health Centers in a number ofstates. A large majority 
of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractualrelationships with third-p
arty payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").Our retail pharmacy ope
rations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e.,shifts in the relativ
e distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorablereimbursement ter
ms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwisereceive preferential coverage treatment); gr
owth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive andpreferred pharmacy n
etwork arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and genericprescription drugs we sell; 
increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which newbrand name pharmaceut
icals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which therewas no prior generic drug compe
tition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands andgenerics); changes in th
e health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increasedcompetition from other retail p
harmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options with or without home delivery options; furtherconsolidation and strateg
ic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacycustomers to pay for drugs pres
cribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholdsto which our level of third-p
arty reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use ofthird-party financi
al assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any additional changes in the regulatoryenvironment for the re
tail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal ofthe Patient Protection and Af
fordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulationsthat affect our re
tail pharmacy business.If the supply of certain ph
armaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severelyaffected until at 
least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in asignificant number of o
ur pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.One or a combination of such fa
ctors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with ourretail pharmacy ope
rations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn,adversely affect our ov
erall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Our failure to attract and reta
in qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materiallyadversely affect our financial per
formance.Our ability to continue to condu
ct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associatesglobally. Our ability to me
et our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs,distribution and fulfil
lment centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous externalfactors, including the av
ailability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels withinthose markets, prevail
ing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws andregulations. Additionally, our 
ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership,and to effectively mo
tivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manageleadership transition succe
ssfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.In addition, if our costs of l
abor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted orimplemented that further increase 
our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.20

Financial RisksFailure to meet market expe
ctations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.We believe that the price of 
our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting theseexpectations, including our 
comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted earnings per share couldcause the market pri
ce of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our financial estimates andrecommendations by securitie
s analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the priceof our stock.
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may mat
erially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.Our operations in countries oth
er than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements aredenominated in U.S. dollars, and to pr
epare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expensesof our operations outside of th
e U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currencyexchange rates that wer
e unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.As a result of such translat
ions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements reflecting
 significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in ourfinancial perform
ance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange ratefluctuations will adversel
y affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on ourreported consolidated r
esults of operations.We may pay for products we purch
ase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which thegoods will be sold. When we must acquir
e the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorableto us, our cost of sales may inc
rease and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, witha corresponding adverse ef
fect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affectour results of operations.
Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our international operations subject us to legis
lative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to thecountries or regions in which we operate, which could materia
lly adversely affect our business or financial performance.In addition to our U.S. operations, we oper
ate our retail business in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.During fiscal 2021, our Walma
rt International operations generated approximately 22% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in variouscountries also source goods and se
rvices from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors,most of which are beyond our contro
l. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal andregulatory constraints 
(such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerceand retail operations in i
nternational markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), antitrust and competition lawregulatory matters 
(such as the competition investigations currently underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to oursubsidiary Wal-Mart Canad
a and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations,local labor laws, anti-
money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection,and other matters in any o
f the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.21

The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, ifthey occurred again, co
uld adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetaryand fiscal policies of 
the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risksassociated with having numerous 
facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our internationaloperations generally in
clude, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty inenforcing intellec
tual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doingbusiness outside of the U.S., and may be exagg
erated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws andregulations.
In foreign countries in which we h
ave operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in businesspractices prohibited by U.S. laws and 
regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries. Wemaintain a global poli
cy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance withthese laws and regulations. Neve
rtheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or fromcountries where practi
ces that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in businesspractices that ar
e prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even ifprohibited by our internal po
licies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely aff
ect our financial performance.In fiscal 2021, our Walma
rt U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 78% of our consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax andtrade policies, includ
ing tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell inour stores and clubs could have an 
adverse effect on our financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores andclubs is manufactured in o
ther countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise(whether imported dire
ctly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adverselyaffect the financ
ial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.We are subject to inco
me taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. Thedetermination of our worldwid
e provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxescould be materially 
adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions that have h
igher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, taxrates, regulations or a
ccounting principles.We are also exposed to futu
re tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any ofwhich can impact our curr
ent and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial positionand results of operations. In 
the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S.corporations and additiona
l guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies is still pending. As further guidance is issuedby these taxing authoriti
es, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the TaxAct, including collecting 
information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs andcould affect our resul
ts of operations.In addition, in response to signi
ficant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of COVID-19, legislatures andtaxing authorities in m
any jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporaryeffect and more per
manent changes. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulationscould have a material effect on
 our effective tax rate.Furthermore, we are subjec
t to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effectsof changing tax regulati
ons and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the taxamounts recorded in our Consolida
ted Financial Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periodsfor which such determi
nation and settlement is made.22

Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate could materially adversely affectour reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance.
We operate in complex 
regulated environments in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existinglegal requirements including
 the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations.Our operations in the U.S. are subjec
t to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangementsaffecting our health 
and wellness operations. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation ofpharmacies; dispensing and s
ale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicareand Medicaid; data priv
acy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws andregulations relating 
to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of,hazardous substances; regul
ations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and the DrugEnforcement Administra
tion (the "DEA"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulationsincluding those of the Consumer Produc
t Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotionof products we sell and the fin
ancial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; patient inducement regulations; and federal and state laws governinghealth care fraud and 
abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and health care services.For example, in the U.S., the DEA and various othe
r regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances.We are required to hold v
alid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlledsubstance acts and rela
ted regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatoryauthorities have broad en
forcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions forviolations of these laws and r
egulations.We are also governed by for
eign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions,health and safety, equal 
employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition andantitrust matters, 
and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer ormake available, such as ou
r money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and preventmoney laundering, sanctions, f
raud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protection. We are also subject to data privacy and protection lawsregulating the colle
ction, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal information, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”),which was recently signific
antly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), as well as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation(“GDPR”). The potential effec
ts of these laws are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantialcosts and expenses to comply. In th
e case of non-compliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processingpersonal data), regula
tors have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year.These administrative 
fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. The CCPA and CPRA give California residents expanded rightsto access, correct and req
uire deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about howtheir personal inform
ation is used. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches.Furthermore, our market
ing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Wemay be subjected to penal
ties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge bycustomer or regulatory 
authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us.The impact of new laws, regula
tions and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannotbe predicted, and chan
ges in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system andoperational changes, be
 difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractivenessof the products or services we o
ffer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation.23

While we strive to adhere our practices and procedures to these laws, they are subject to evolving regulations, interpretations and regulator discretion. To the extenta regulator or court dis
agrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, wecould be subject to civil 
and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments fromgovernment programs; loss of 
required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including theMedicare and Medicaid p
rograms in the U.S.; loss of licenses; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and third-partypayers; and significant 
fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or inany of the countries in which we ope
rate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect onour business operations, financ
ial position and results of operations.We are subject to risks related to 
litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial positionand liquidity.
We operate in a highly r
egulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, andinvestigations, inspections, 
audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities. We mayalso have indemnifica
tion obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative actionand class action and mult
i-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be classactions and/or involve par
ties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years.For example, we are curren
tly a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have broughtclaims under federa
l and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claimsunder federal and stat
e consumer laws.The Company has also been responding to subpoen
as, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlledsubstance dispensing and distribu
tion practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids including theconsolidated multidistrict litigati
on entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Lit igation (MDL No. 2804), currently pending in the U.S. Distri ct Court for theNorthern District of Ohio. Simil
ar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providersand other plaintiffs. Pla
intiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. On October 22, 2020, theCompany filed a declara
tory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and theU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, 
asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing anddistribution of opioids under th
e Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). The Company’s action was dismissed and the Company is appealing the decision. OnDecember 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civ
il complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Companyunlawfully dispensed controll
ed substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies in violation of the CSA. TheDOJ is seeking civil penalties 
and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. In addition, the Company isthe subject of two securit
ies class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect to opioids filed in theU.S. District Court for the Distric
t of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stockfrom March 30, 2016 through Decembe
r 22, 2020. A derivative action was also filed by one of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Delaware on Februa
ry 9, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of theCompany’s distribution and dispensing o
f opioids.The Company cannot predict the nu
mber of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claimsand the related opioid m
atters.We discuss these cases and oth
er litigation to which we are party below under the caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings " and in Note 10  in the " Notes to our Consolidated Financial State
ments," which are part of this Annual Repor t on Form 10-K.24

Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actionsand proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the cos
ts for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage ourshareholders from bringing claims, or
 limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers,associates or shareholders in such capacity.
Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent 
in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullestextent permitted by l
aw, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or formerdirector, officer, 
associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery.The exclusive forum provision 
may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that theshareholder finds favorab
le for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits againstus and such persons. Alternatively, 
if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which theyare intended to apply, then we 
may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business,financial position or r
esults of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our shareholders will not be deemed to havewaived our compliance with, and 
the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actionsbrought under, the federal s
ecurities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules andregulations promulgated 
thereunder.ITEM 1B.

ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSI ON AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview
This discussion, which presents our resu
lts for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021"), January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020") and January 31, 2019("fiscal 2019"), should be read 
in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to providethe reader with inform
ation that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period toperiod and the primary f
actors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company'sperformance. Additional
ly, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of howeach of those segments and i
ts results of operations affect the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a whole.Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segm
ent operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of theCompany's segments using each segmen
t's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, werevise the measurem
ent of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operatingdecision maker.
Management also measures t
he results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores andclubs by measuring the change 
in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previousyear. Walmart's def
inition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansionsand conversions, as well as eComme
rce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channeltransactions which are fu
lfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversionof that store is accomp
anied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divestedbusinesses are excluded fro
m comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparablesales are also refe
rred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. Asa result, our calculation 
of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.In discussing our operating resu
lts, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countrieswhere the functional cur
rency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference betweencurrent period activ
ity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally,no currency exchange rat
e fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results ofthis calculation as th
e impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operatingincome, of the Company and the W
almart International segment in the future.Our business is seasonal to a cer
tain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest salesvolume and operating incom
e have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31; however, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on consumerbehaviors that could resul
t in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business.We have taken certain strategic acti
ons to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including the following highlights over the last threeyears:
•
Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart") in August 2018. Refer toNote 12
 for additional inform ation on the transaction.•
Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12  for additional informat
ion on the transaction.•
Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile and Walmart Canada in December 2018 and April 2019, respectively.•
In October 2020, we agreed to sell Asda for net consideration of $9.4 billion and recognized an estimated non-cash loss in fiscal 2021 of $5.7 billion, aftertax, which includes the loss assoc
iated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan. In February 2021, we completed the sale of Asda. Referto 
Note 11 and Note 12 . •
In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and recorded a non-cash loss of $1.0 billion, after-tax, primarily due to cumulativeforeign currency trans
lation losses. Refer to Note 12 . 33

•In November 2020, we agreed to sell a majority stake in Seiyu for net consideration of approximately $1.2 billion and recognized an estimated non-cashloss of $1.9 billion, after-
tax, in fiscal 2021. In March 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu. Refer to Note 12 . We operate in the highly
 competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount,department, drug, dollar, v
ariety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors arenational, regional or inter
national chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies forattracting and ret
aining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophicevents, weather, global hea
lth epidemics including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levelsand buying patterns, consumer c
redit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energyprices, general econom
ic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Furtherinformation on the fac
tors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under"
Item 1A. Risk Factors." COVID-19 Updates
Throughout fiscal 2021, we have opera
ted with a clear set of priorities to guide our decision making through the COVID-19 pandemic. These priorities are:•
Supporting our associates on the front lines in terms of their physical safety, financial health and emotional well-being. We are providing extra pay andbenefits, including speci
al cash bonuses to associates and the introduction of a COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy in the U.S.•
Serving our customers as safely as possible and keeping our supply chain operating. We reduced our store operating hours at the onset of the COVID-19pandemic and have expanded sto
re hours slightly toward the end of the year.•

Managing the business well both operationally and financially and driving our long-term strategy. We are maintaining our everyday low-price disciplinewhile investing in our omni-ch
annel offering which continues to resonate with customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.While we incurred incr
emental costs of $4.0 billion during fiscal 2021 associated with operating during a global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted inoverall net sales growth dur
ing fiscal 2021 with strong comparable sales in the U.S. and the majority of our international markets. Sales trends were positivelyaffected by eCommerc
e growth acceleration and we also saw customers consolidate shopping trips and purchase larger baskets. For a detailed discussion on resultsof operations by reportabl
e segment, refer to "Results of Operations " below. We expect continued unce
rtainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the duration and extent ofeconomic stimulus; ti
ming and effectiveness of global vaccines; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which may impact our results.Company Performance Metrics
We are committed 
to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust ourbusiness strategies to ma
intain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  We define our financial framework as:•
strong, efficient growth;•
consistent operating discipline; and•
strategic capital allocation.As we execute on this financia
l framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.34

Strong, Efficient GrowthOur objective of priorit
izing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales,accelerating eComm
erce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we makestrategic investmen
ts which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.Comparable sales is a me
tric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, includingeCommerce sales, for a p
articular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retailcalendar (also known as the 4-5
-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterlyearnings releases. However, when we dis
cuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar,which may result in diffe
rences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar.Calendar comparable sa
les, including the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2021 and 2020, were as follows:

ing fuel, increased 8.7% and 2.7% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. WalmartU.S. comparable sales incre
ased 8.7% and 2.9% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. For fiscal 2021, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in averageticket primarily 
resulting from increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a decline in transactions as customers consolidated shoppingtrips. For fiscal 2020, compar
able sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket and transactions. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributedapproximately 5.4% and 2.1% to 
comparable sales for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for ourcustomers.
Sam's Club comparable sales in
creased 8.7% and 1.6% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. For fiscal 2021, Sam's Club comparable sales benefited from growthin transactions and aver
age ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations andby lower fuel sales. Sam's Club compa
rable sales for fiscal 2020 benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by loweraverage ticket due to ou
r decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% and1.8% to comparable sales 
for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.Consistent Operating Discipline
We operate with discipl
ine by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowestcost to serve. We invest in 
technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating disciplinethrough expense leverage, which we d
efine as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative ("operating") expenses.Fiscal Years Ended January 31,

cremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segmentrecorded in the second quar
ter of fiscal 2021.For fiscal 2020, operating expens
es as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points compared to the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expensemanagement combined with ou
r growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in business restructuring chargesconsisting primarily of non
-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuring charges due tostrategic decisions th
at resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments.35

Strategic Capital AllocationOur strategy includes improv
ing our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such,we are allocating mor
e capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings. Total fiscal 2021 capitalexpenditures decreased s
lightly compared to the prior year. The following table provides additional detail:(Amounts in millions)
Fiscal Years Ended January 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures

$ 7,828 $ 7,904 Walmart International
2,436 2,801 Total capital expenditures
$ 10,264 $ 10,705 Returns
As we execute our financial 
framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return oninvestment and free c
ash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources
 section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most d
irectly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting principles in 
the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAPfinancial measure, 
management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deployingits assets. Trends in ROI can fluc
tuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.6% and 6.7%for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respec
tively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the losses on certain international operations held for sale or sold, partially offsetby the fair value change 
in our equity investments as well as the increase in operating income. ROI was 14.0% and 13.4% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.The increase in ROI was primar
ily due to the increase in operating income.We define ROI as adj
usted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing twelvemonths divided by average inves
ted capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plusaverage accumulated depreciation a
nd average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. For fiscal 2020, leaserelated assets and associate
d accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of that balance sheet date, rather than averaged,because they are not dir
ectly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. A two-pointaverage was used for leased 
assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02") . Our calculation of ROI is conside
red a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that areincluded and excluded in the 
most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from ourreported operating inco
me in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed inaccordance with genera
lly accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated netincome for the period div
ided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interestincome; adjusts total asset
s for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital.Because of the adjustments 
mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investorsthan ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial 
measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by managementto calculate our ROI may di
ffer from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.36

The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non
-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additionalcash from our business operat
ions, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. Free cash flow should beconsidered in addition to, r
ather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as ameasure of our liquidity. Se
e "Liquidity and Capital Resources " for discussions of GAAP metrics including n et cash provided by operating activities, net cash usedin investing activiti
es and net cash used in financing activities.We define free cash 
flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cashprovided by operating activ
ities of $36.1 billion, $25.3 billion and $27.8 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $25.8billion, $14.6 billion and $17.4 bill
ion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 increased whencompared to fiscal 2020 pr
imarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment ofinventory purchases, incre
mental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020due to the same reasons as th
e increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in decreased capital expenditures. Net cash provided byoperating activiti
es for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the contribution to the Asda pension plan in anticipation of its(1)(1), (2)

future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared tofiscal 2019 due to the same 
reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures.Walmart's definit
ion of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that themeasure does not deduct the p
ayments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, webelieve it is import
ant to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Although other companies repor
t their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used bymanagement to calculate our free ca
sh flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.The following table sets for
th a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe tobe the GAAP financial measure mos
t directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash usedin financing activities.

Our total revenues, which includ
es net sales and membership and other income, increased $35.2 billion or 6.7% and $9.6 billion or 1.9% for fiscal 2021 and 2020,respectively, when compar
ed to the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales, which increased $35.3 billion or 6.8% and$9.6 billion or 1.9% for fisca
l 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to strongpositive comparable sa
les for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments as well as positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets resultingfrom increased demand s
temming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall net sales growth was strong despite certain operating limitations in several internationalmarkets in the second quar
ter of fiscal 2021 due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The net salesincrease was partial
ly offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion. For fiscal 2020, net sales were positively impacted by overallpositive comparable sa
les for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with the addition of net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in August 2018, andpositive comparable sa
les in the majority of our international markets. These increases were partially offset by $4.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations incurrency exchange rat
es in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018.Our gross profit rate incr
eased 20 basis points and decreased 40 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Forfiscal 2021, the increas
e was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives, strong sales in higher margin categories, and fewer markdowns. This was partiallyoffset in the Walma
rt U.S. segment by carryover of prior year price investment as well as the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers inresponse to the

COVID-19 pandemic. For fiscal 2020, the decrease was primarily due to price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment and the addition of Flipkart in the WalmartInternational segmen
t, partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the WalmartU.S. segment.
For fiscal 2021, operating expens
es as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net salesbenefited from strong growth 
in comparable sales and lapping the $0.9 billion business restructuring charges from the prior year described below. These benefitswere offset by $4.0 billion of in
cremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segmentrecorded in the second quar
ter of fiscal 2021.For fiscal 2020, operating expens
es as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year, due to our focus on expensemanagement combined with ou
r growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in business restructuring chargesconsisting primarily of non
-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuring charges due tostrategic decisions th
at resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments.Other gains and losses consisted of n
et gains of $0.2 billion and $2.0 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The gain in fiscal 2021 primarily reflects$8.7 billion in net gains associ
ated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, partially offset by the $8.3 billion pre-tax loss related to the divestiture ofcertain internat
ional operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021. The gain in fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of a $1.9 billion increase in themarket value of our inves
tment in JD.com.Our effective income 
tax rate was 33.3% for fiscal 2021, 24.4% for fiscal 2020, and 37.4% for fiscal 2019. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 ascompared to fiscal 2020 is p
rimarily due to the loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for or sold in fiscal 2021, whichprovided minimal rea
lizable tax benefit. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the fiscal 2019 losson sale of a majority sta
ke in Walmart Brazil, which increased the previous comparative fiscal year's effective tax rate, as it provided minimal realizable taxbenefit. Our effectiv
e income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuationallowances, changes in tax l
aw, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations andinternational opera
tions, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation fromthe U.S. statutory rate to the 
effective income tax rates for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 is presented in Note 9 . As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, we reported $13.7 billion and $15.2 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, whichrepresents a decreas
e of $1.5 billion and an increase of $8.0 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted netincome per common share

increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 8.7% and 2.9% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.Comparable sales in fisc
al 2021 were driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic conditions relatedto the COVID-19 pandemic while transa
ctions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips. Comparable sales in fiscal 2020 were driven by both averageticket and transact
ion growth for fiscal 2020. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 5.4% and 2.1% to comparable sales for fiscal2021 and 2020, respectively, as we cont
inue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers.Gross profit rate was flat 
and decreased 14 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While fiscal 2021 grossprofit rate was flat, 
it benefited from strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, offset by a change in merchandise mix, the carryover effect of prior yearprice investment and th
e temporary closure of our Auto Care and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For fiscal 2020, the decrease wasprimarily the resul
t of continued price investments which were partially offset by better merchandise mix, including strength in private brands, and less pressurefrom transportation costs.

Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 15 and 4 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previousfiscal year. We lev
eraged operating expenses in fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of strong sales, which were partially offset by $3.2 billion of incremental costsrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic 
including special bonuses, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, costs associated with outfitting our stores and associateswith masks, gloves and sanitize
r, and expanded cleaning practices. Fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also slightly aided by lappingthe $0.5 billion business restru
cturing charges from the prior year described below, offset by a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge recorded in the secondquarter of fiscal 2021 r
esulting from changes to Walmart U.S. support teams to better support its omni-channel strategy. The decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarilydue to strong sales and productiv
ity improvements which were mostly offset by business restructuring charges of $0.5 billion consisting primarily of non-cashimpairment charges 
for certain trade names, acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charges due to decisions that resulted in the writedown of certain eCommerce 
assets.As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, segment operating income increased $1.7 billion and decreased $6 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, whencompared to the previous f

iscal year. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven bychanges in consumer behavior 
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion. Thepandemic led to signifi
cant economic pressures and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior, including accelerated growth in eCommerce inseveral markets. Whi
le several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter as a result of government mandates, mostclosed stores and warehouses had r
esumed operations by the third quarter.For fiscal 2020, the decreas
e was primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.1 billion as well as a reduction in sales due to our sale ofthe majority stake in 
Walmart Brazil in August 2018, offset by a full year of net sales from Flipkart and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of ourmarkets.
Gross profit rate incre
ased 50 basis points and decreased 136 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Forfiscal 2021, the increas

in merchandise mix.Operating expenses as a perc
entage of segment net sales increased 14 basis points and decreased 13 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, whencompared to the previous f

elated to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and lapping the impairmentcharges in the prior yea
r discussed below. Fiscal 2020 decreased primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets as well as cost disciplineacross multiple mark
ets, partially offset by $0.4 billion in impairment charges primarily due to the write-off of the carrying value of one of Flipkart's two fashiontrade names, Jabong.com, as a 
result of a strategic decision to focus our efforts on a single fashion platform in order to simplify the business and customerproposition.
As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, segment operating income increased $0.3 billion and decreased $1.5 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, whencompared to the previous f

t permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations,which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatili
ty in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses suchinformation to better measure underlying operating results in the segment.
Net sales for the Sam's Club segmen
t increased $5.1 billion or 8.7% and $1.0 billion or 1.6% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to theprevious fiscal year. Our 8.7% g
rowth in comparable sales for fiscal 2021 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19pandemic, partially o
ffset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positivelycontributed approximat
ely 2.2% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2020, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 1.6%. Comparablesales benefited from g
rowth in transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certainclub locations. Sam's Club eCommer
ce sales positively contributed approximately 1.8% to comparable sales.Gross profit rate incre
ased 65 basis points and decreased 11 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Theincrease in gross profit 
rate was due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offsetby price investment and high
er eCommerce fulfillment costs. For fiscal 2020 , gross profit rate decr eased due to price investment and higher eCommercefulfillment costs, pa
rtially offset by reduced tobacco sales.Membership and other incom
e increased 6.8% and 4.7% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2021 and2020, the increases were pri
marily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates, and higher Plus Member penetration. Fiscal2021 growth was also positively affe
cted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Fiscal 2020 was also benefited by gains on property sales and other income.Operating expenses as a perc
entage of segment net sales increased 42 and decreased 19 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to theprevious fiscal year. Despi
te increased net sales from the strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage ofnet sales increased pr
imarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expandedcleaning practices 
and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase inoperating expense as a per
centage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales. For fiscal 2020, the decrease was primarily the result oflower labor-related 
costs and a charge of approximately $50 million related to lease exit costs in the prior comparable period. These benefits were partially offsetby a reduction in sales of tob
acco and a higher level of technology investment.As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, segment operating income increased $0.3 billion and $0.1 billion for fiscal 2021 and  2020, respectively, when compar edto the previous fiscal ye

Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity
The strength and stability o
f our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities,supplemented with our long-te
rm debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that supportthe long-term growth of our ope
rations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock andshare repurchases. We be
lieve our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, paydividends and fund our share repur
chases for the foreseeable future.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

$ 36,074 $ 25,255 $ 27,753 Net cash provided by operating a
ctivities was $36.1 billion, $25.3 billion and $27.8 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided byoperating activities for fiscal 
2021 increased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which acceleratedinventory sell-through, as wel
l as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments. Thedecrease in net cash prov
ided by operating activities for fiscal 2020, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to the contribution to our Asdapension plan in anticipat
ion of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments.Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Defic
itCash and cash equivalents were $17.7 bi
llion and $9.5 billion as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We maintained more cash at January 31, 2021compared to January 31, 2020 in orde
r to provide us with enhanced financial flexibility due to the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our workingcapital deficit, d
efined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $2.6 billion and $16.0 billion as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Thedecrease in working capit
al deficit as compared to the previous fiscal year is primarily driven by the increase in cash and cash equivalents as well as the increase incurrent assets and curr
ent liabilities due to the classification of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan as held for sale. We generally operate with aworking capital defici
t due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in theform of payments of cash div
idends and share repurchases.We use intercompany fin
ancing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum costpossible. Additionally, from t
ime-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S.  Historically, U.S. taxes were due uponrepatriation of for
eign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incurother taxes such as withholding or s
tate taxes. While we are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and the U.S.Treasury Department, we do not exp
ect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts heldoutside the U.S. to have a mater
ial effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations.As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, cash and cash equiva
lents of $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to locallaws or other restrict
ions. Of the $2.8 billion as of January 31, 2021, approximately $1.0 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financingarrangements subject 
to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

tions and to expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies and supply chain, remodel existing stores and clubs andadd new stores and clubs. Net cash used in 
investing activities increased $0.9 billion for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as a resultof lapping the net proceeds 
received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada and the change in other investing activities, partially offset bydecreased capital 
expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $14.9 billion for fiscal 2020 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily asa result of the $13.8 billion p
ayment for the acquisition of Flipkart, net of cash acquired, as well as payments for other, smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2019.42

actions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Fiscal 2021 netcash used in financing act
ivities increased $1.8 billion when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to the timing ofissuances and repayments of 
long-term debt, partially offset by both a reduction in cash used to pay down short-term borrowings as well as share repurchases as wemanage our financial pos
ition during the current economic environment. Fiscal 2020 net cash used in financing activities increased $11.8 billion for fiscal 2020when compared to the same pe
riod in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received in fiscal 2019 from theissuance of long-term deb
t to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart partially offset by $5.5 billion of additional long-term debt in the fiscal 2020 to fundgeneral business operations.
Short-term Borrowings
We generally utili
ze the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capitalexpenditures and other cash 
requirements. The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2021,2020 and 2019:

Company Share Repurchase ProgramFrom time to time, the Comp
any repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. Allrepurchases made during f
iscal 2021 were made under the $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, of which authorization for $3.0 billionof share repurchases re
mained as of January 31, 2021. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase programwhich, beginning February 22, 2021, replac
ed the previous share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to anunissued status.
We regularly review sha
re repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things,current cash needs, capa
city for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority ofthe ongoing share repurchase p
rogram will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the numberof shares repurchased, ave
rage price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:Fiscal Years Ended January 31,

$ 135.20 $ 105.98 $ 93.18 Total amount paid for share repurchases
$ 2,625 $ 5,717 $ 7,410 Capital Resources
We believe cash flows fro
m operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cashneeds, which include funding seasona
l buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and sharerepurchases.
We have strong commerc
ial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due atfavorable rates in c
apital markets. As of January 31, 2021, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were asfollows:
Rating agency
  Commercial paper   Long-term debt Standard & Poor's
  A-1+   AA Moody's Investors Service
  P-1   Aa2 Fitch Ratings
  F1+   AA Credit rating agencies 
review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.Accordingly, we are not able to p
redict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings includechanges in our operating per
formance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt andcapitalization, and 
changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs orimpair our ability to access
 capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratingscould impair our ability t
o access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to relymore heavily on more expens
ive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper ordebt securities. Each r
ating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of anyother rating. Moreover, e
ach credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.44

ligations of $1.3 billion.(4)    Includes obligations related to our operations in Japan and the United Kingdom which are classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021.
Under the terms of the
 sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies andother matters for up to R$2.3 bi
llion, adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. As of January 31, 2021, the indemnification liability was$0.6 billion and recorded in de
ferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.Estimated interest p
ayments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2021, and assumes interest ratesremain at current 
levels for our variable rate debt. Additionally, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. as of January 31,2021.
Purchase obligations include 
legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capitalexpenditures, software acqu
isition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of the above table, contractual obligations forthe purchase of goods or servic
es are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed orminimum quantities to b
e purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify theCompany will purchase all or a po
rtion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, areexcluded from the tabl
e above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations topurchase rather than bind
ing agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods.We also enter into cont
racts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clausesallowing for cancellation 
without significant penalty.The expected timing for p
ayment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be differentdepending on the timing of re
ceipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.In addition to the amounts shown in th
e table above, $1.7 billion of net unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded asliabilities. The timing of t
he payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9  to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements for additionaldiscussion of unrecognized tax b
enefits.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of January 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sh
eet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on ourconsolidated financia
l position, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.(1)(2)

the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings" in Note 10  to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements. We also discuss various legalproceedings related to 
the Asda Equal Value Claims and Opioids Litigation in "Item 3. Legal Proceedings " herein under the caption "Suppl emental Information."The foregoing matters and o
ther matters described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent contingencies of the Company that may or may notresult in the Compan
y incurring a material liability upon their final resolution.Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates
Management strives to r
eport our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex andrequire us to use technic
al terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in theU.S. These principles require us to 
make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in ourfinancial statem
ents. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.Management continually 
reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is asummary of our critic
al accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.Inventories
We value inventories a
t the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO")method for Walmart U.S. segm
ent's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. Whennecessary, we record a LIFO provision 
for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. OurLIFO provision is calculated bas
ed on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to ourretail price indi
ces would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, our inventories valued at LIFOapproximated those invento
ries as if they were valued at first-in, first-out ("FIFO").Impairment of Assets
We evaluate long-lived asset
s for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.Management's judgments
 regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-livedassets is performed at 
the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on anumber of conditions, including un
certainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period.These factors could cause 
management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result inmanagement determ
ining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Impairment charges on assets heldand used were immateri
al in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2021 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease inthe undiscounted cash flows for th
e stores or clubs with indicators of impairment.In fiscal 2021, the Company's opera
tions in Argentina, Japan and the United Kingdom met the held for sale criteria. As a result, the individual disposal groupswere measured at fai
r value, less costs to sell, which resulted in impairment charges that were included in the total estimated pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion recorded infiscal 2021. Refer to 
Note 12 . Fiscal 2019 included a pre-t ax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which included fullimpairment of all related assets.
Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets
We account for business comb
inations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired andliabilities assumed, includi
ng amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Thedetermination of fair values 
of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.For intangible assets acqui
red in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, butare not limited to, th
e amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values ofidentifiable assets 
and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.46

Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a singlereporting unit if the co
mponents have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2021, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., WalmartInternational and Sam's Club. Goodwill 
and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually orwhenever events or c
hanges in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitativeassessment to determine 
whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, thatthe fair value of the 
reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of thecarrying amount cannot 
be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to makejudgments relating to fu
ture cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reportingunit or asset using a valuat
ion method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficientreturns to recover the 
cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have alsohistorically genera
ted sufficient returns to recover their cost. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods,future operating results c
ould be materially impacted. Due to certain strategic restructuring decisions, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion in impairment infiscal 2020 related to 
acquired trade names and acquired developed software.Contingencies
We are involved in a numbe
r of legal proceedings. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable.We also perform an assess
ment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurredin excess of amounts accru
ed. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would bematerial, we provide dis
closure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determinewhether the likelihood of loss h
as changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able topredict the outcome or reas
onably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10  to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements, and havenot recorded an associate
d accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverseeffect on our business, finan
cial position, results of operations or cash flows.Income Taxes
Income taxes have a signi
ficant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, thedetermination of our prov
ision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.Our effective income 
tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuationallowances, changes in tax l
aw, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and internationaloperations where the statu
tory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.Our tax returns are routin
ely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions arerecorded in our financi
al statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, fromtaxing authorities. When 
facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Weaccount for uncertain 
tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in thefinancial statem
ents. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible andtaxable items.

resent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporarydifferences between th
e financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred taxassets are evaluated 
for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factorsare considered when assessing wheth
er it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations offuture taxable income, carryfor
ward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated byassessing the adequac
y of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings andavailable tax planning s
trategies. This evaluation relies on estimates.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enact
ed and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reducedthe U.S. statutory tax rate f
rom 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. As discussed in Note 9  to our Consolidated Financial State
ments, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As further guidance is issued by the U.S.Treasury Department, the 
IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accountingguidance.

ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCL OSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket Risk
In addition to the risks inhe
rent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fairvalue of certain equi
ty investments.The analysis presented below fo
r each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does notrepresent our view of futur
e market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,however, a change in one facto
r could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in 
interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managingthe mix of fixed and vari
able rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2021, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased $69 millionprimarily due to fluctuation
s in market interest rates.The table below provides infor
mation about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents theprincipal cash flows and re
lated weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flowsand weighted-average int
erest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows tobe exchanged under the contr
acts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2021.Expected Maturity Date

As of January 31, 2021, our variable ra
te borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 9% of our total short-termand long-term debt. Based on Janua
ry 31, 2021 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change byapproximately $42 million.
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctu
ations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term
 debt. For fiscal 2021, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheetsresulted in the $0.2 billion n
et gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss.We hedge a portion of our for
eign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $83 millionand $241 million as of January 31, 2021 and J
anuary 31, 2020, respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currencyexchange rates, prima
rily due to the strengthening of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2021. The hypothetical result of a uniform 10%weakening in the value of the U.S. doll
ar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $524million. A hypothetical 10% 
change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2021 would have resulted in a changein the value of the swaps of $46 mi
llion.(1)48

In addition to currency swaps, we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivativehedges of net investments of 
certain of our foreign operations. We had outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion as of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020 thatwas designated as a hedge of our ne
t investment in the U.K. As of January 31, 2021, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relativeto the British pound would have result
ed in a change in the value of the debt of $210 million. In addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of ¥100 billion as ofJanuary 31, 2021 and ¥180 billion as of Janua
ry 31, 2020 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan. As of January 31, 2021, a hypothetical10% change in value of the U.S. dolla
r relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $87 million. As of January 31, 2021,the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan 
are classified as held for sale, and subsequently closed in February 2021 and March 2021, respectively. Refer toNote 12
 to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements.In certain countries, we
 also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated innon-functional currencies.
Investment Risk
We are exposed to changes in 
the stock price of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values. The change in fair value is recorded within othergains and losses and resulted in 
a gain of $8.7 billion in fiscal 2021 due to net increases in the stock price of those equity investments. As of January 31, 2021, thefair value of our equity 
investments with readily determinable fair values was $14.4 billion. As of January 31, 2021, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock priceof such investments would have chang
ed the fair value of such investments by approximately $1.4 billion.49

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Di
rectors of Walmart Inc.Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidatedstatements of income, 
comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, and the relatednotes (collectively 
referred to as the "Consolidated Financial Statements"). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all materialrespects, the financi
al position of the Company at January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in theperiod ended January 31, 2021, in confor
mity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a pub
lic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicate
d below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe communicated to the au
dit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging, subjective o
r complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated FinancialStatements, taken as a whole, 
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on theaccounts or disclosures to which 
they relate.Contingencies 
Description of the Matter
As described in Note 10 to the Consolidat ed Financial Statements, at January 31, 2021, the Company is involved in a number oflegal proceedings and has m
ade accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate. For some matters, a liability is notprobable, or the amou
nt cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. Where a liability is reasonablypossible and may be mater
ial, such matters have been disclosed. Management assessed the probability of occurrence and theestimation of any potent
ial loss based on the ability to predict the number of claims that may be filed or whether any loss or rangeof loss can be reasonably est
imated. For example, in assessing the probability of occurrence in a particular legal proceeding,management exercises judgment
 to determine if it can predict the number of claims that may be filed and whether it can reasonablyestimate any loss or rang
e of loss that may arise from that proceeding. In connection with the sale of Asda, the Company is nolonger liable for the Asda Equ
al Value Claims; however, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification for any potentialAsda liability related to t
hese claims up to a contractually determined amount.51

Auditing management’s accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies and the estimated fair value of relatedindemnifications was comp
lex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant judgments made bymanagement when assessing the p
robability of occurrence for contingencies or related indemnifications or when determiningwhether an estimate of 
the loss or range of loss could be made.How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification andevaluation
 of  contingencies  and  related  indemnities.  For  example,  we  tested  controls  over  the  Company’s  assessment  of  thelikelihood of loss and the Company’s d
eterminations regarding the measurement of loss.To test the Company’s assessment o
f the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, amongother procedures, we read th
e minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors,reviewed opinions provided to the Comp
any by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal andexternal counsel, and eva
luated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel. We alsoevaluated the appropriatenes
s of the related disclosures. To test the estimated fair value of indemnities, we involved a valuationspecialist to evalua
te the valuation methodologies and significant assumptions including, among others, the discount rate.Valuation of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
Description of the Matter
At  January  31,  2021,  the  Company  has  $4.9  billion  of  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  which  primarily  consist  of  acquiredtradenames.
 As disclosed in Notes 1, 8 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, these assets are evaluated for impairmentat
 least annually using valuation techniques to estimate fair value. These fair value estimates are sensitive to certain significantassumptions including revenue g
rowth rates, discount rates, and royalty rates.Auditing management’s annua
l indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests was complex and highly judgmental due to thesignificant measurement uncertaint
y in determining the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangibles. For example, the fair valueestimates are sensitive to si
gnificant assumptions identified above that are affected by future market or economic conditions.How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit
We  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the  Company’sindefinite-lived
 intangible  asset  impairment  review  process.  Our  procedures  included,  among  others,  testing  controls  overmanagement’s
 review  of  the  significant  assumptions  described  above  used  to  estimate  the  fair  values  of  the  indefinite-livedintangible assets.
To test the estimated fair val
ues of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, amongothers, assessing methodologies us
ed to determine the fair value, testing the significant assumptions discussed above and testingthe completeness and ac
curacy of the underlying data used by the Company. For example, we evaluated management’s forecastedrevenue growth rates used in th
e fair value estimates by comparing those assumptions to the historical results of the Company andcurrent industry, marke
t and economic forecasts. We involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the valuationmethodologies and the signif
icant assumptions such as discount rates and royalty rates. Additionally, we performed sensitivityanalyses of significant a
ssumptions to evaluate the effect on the fair value estimates of the indefinite-lived intangible assets./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Di
rectors of Walmart Inc.Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Walmart Inc.'
s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-IntegratedFramework issued by the Committe
e of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, WalmartInc. (the Company) mainta
ined, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the accompanyingconsolidated balance she
ets of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders'equity and cash flows for each o
f the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated March 19, 2021 expressed anunqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion onthe Company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to beindependent with respect to 
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities andExchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether effective inter
nal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe design and operating ef
fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financia
l ReportingA company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Walmart Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Walmart Inc. ("Wa
lmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity toshop in retail stores and th
rough eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlesslyintegrates eCommerce and retail 
stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers.The Company's operations comprise 
three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021"),January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020") and Janu
ary 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019"). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. TheCompany consolidates variabl
e interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investmentsfor which the Company exercises s
ignificant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities andequity method investments 
are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company's Consolidated Financial Sta
tements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. TheCompany consolidates all othe
r operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during themonth of January 2021 related 
to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles requiremanagement to make es
timates and assumptions, including potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, that affect thereported amounts of assets 
and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of thefinancial statem
ents and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments wi
th a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronictransfer transact
ions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classifiedas cash and cash equivalents 
totaled $4.1 billion and $1.7 billion as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.The Company's cash balances are h
eld in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $17.7 billion and $9.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as ofJanuary 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, approxima
tely 40% and 80% were held outside of the U.S., respectively. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of theU.S. are generally utiliz
ed to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations.The Company uses intercompany fin
ancing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimumcost possible.
As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, cash and cash equiva
lents of approximately $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S.due to local laws or other r
estrictions. Of the $2.8 billion as of January 31, 2021, approximately $1.0 billion can only be accessed through dividends orintercompany financing 
arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart") minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to beutilized to fund the oper
ations of Flipkart.Receivables
Receivables are stat
ed at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includesinsurance companies resu
lting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days toprocess; suppliers for ma
rketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. As of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020,receivables from t
ransactions with customers, net were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively.59

InventoriesThe Company values inventories a
t the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out("LIFO") method for the Walm
art U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventorymethod of accounting, using the 
first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of costor market, since perm
anent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valuedusing the weighted-average 
cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated thoseinventories as if they wer
e valued at FIFO.Held for Sale
Components and businesses that mee
t accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company'sfinancial statem
ents with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell.  TheCompany reviews its businesses and asse
ts held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable incomparison to estimat
ed fair values.  As of January 31, 2021, $19.2 billion assets held for sale and $12.7 billion liabilities held for sale were classified in prepaidexpenses and other and accru
ed liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively, reflecting the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan classified asheld for sale. Refer to 
Note 12  for additional detai ls. As of January 31, 2020, assets and liabilities held for sale were immaterial.Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are 
initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements arecapitalized, while cos
ts of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipmentbalances, and includes the 
estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:As of January 31,

$ 92,201 $ 105,208 Leasehold improvements are
 depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Totaldepreciation and amor
tization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and financing obligations, property under capital leases andintangible assets for f
iscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $11.2 billion, $11.0 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively.Leases
For any new or modified lease, th
e Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease obligat
ions for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over theterm of the lease. As the 
rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used incalculating the pres
ent value of the sum of the lease payments.Lease term is defined 
as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company willexercise the option. The Company h
as elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initialterm of 12 months or less.
For a majority of all c
lasses of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been 
combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance.60

Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsManagement reviews long-l
ived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not berecoverable. The evalu
ation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flowsexpected to be generat
ed by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carryingamount of the assets may not b
e recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by anappropriate market appraisal or
 other valuation technique.Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess o
f the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reportingunit when acquired. Other acqui
red intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intendeduse of the related asse
t. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever eventsor changes in circumstance
s indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortizedon a straight-line basis ov
er the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.Goodwill is assigned to the report
ing unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a singlereporting unit if the co
mponents have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2021, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., WalmartInternational and Sam's Club. Goodwill 
is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units.Generally, a qualitative as
sessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, afterperforming an assessment b
ased on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that afair value of the repo
rting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required.The quantitative test 
for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on thediscounted cash flo
w method and relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantlygreater than the ca
rrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.The following table refl

included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $4.9billion and $5.2 billion, respe
ctively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consists of acquired trade names. Refer to Note 12  for additional information related to acquired
 intangible assets for the Flipkart acquisition in fiscal 2019. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangibleassets for fiscal 2021. During f
iscal 2020, the Company incurred approximately $0.7 billion in impairment charges related to its intangible assets. Refer to Note 8 for additional information.
Fair Value Measurement
The Company records and discloses c
ertain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the assetcould be sold in an orderly tr
ansaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is theamount that would be paid to tr
ansfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liabilitywith the creditor. Refer 
to Note 8  for more information. Additionally, the Company may provid
e routine indemnifications in connection with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, for which an indemnificationliability equal to th
e estimated fair value of the obligation is recorded upon inception.  Where necessary, these obligations are recorded at their fair value withindeferred income tax
es and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.(1)(1)

InvestmentsInvestments in equity secu
rities with readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets withchanges in fair value r
ecognized in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 8  for details. Equity invest ments without readilydeterminable fai
r values are carried at cost in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and adjusted for any observable price changes orimpairments record
ed in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Investments in debt sec
urities classified as held-to-maturity are reported at amortized cost in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets withinterest or dividend inco
me recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a numbe
r of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certainemployee-related healthcare benefits.
 Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of thebalance sheet date on an und
iscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to th
e processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reservevaluations. To limit exposur
e to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coveragefor workers' compensation, gene
ral liability and auto liability.Derivatives
The Company uses derivatives for h
edging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain anappropriate mix of fix
ed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. TheCompany may be exposed to credit
-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Credit risk is monitored through establishedapproval procedures, includ
ing setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty. The Companyenters into derivativ
es with counterparties rated only "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The Company is subject to master nettingarrangements which provides s
et-off and close out netting of exposures with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in itsConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Company
’s collateral arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds,after considering the effects 
of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received under these arrangements was not significant as of January31, 2021 and 2020. The Company was not required to provid
e any cash collateral to counterparties as of January 31, 2021 and 2020.In order to qualify for hedg
e accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategyfor undertaking the hedging t
ransaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of thehedge, derivative gains
 and losses are recorded through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensiveloss until the hedged item 
is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has notelected hedge account
ing, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in theCompany's Consolidated Balance Sheets as 
either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded aseither current or non-current
 liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 8  for the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities.Fair Value Hedges
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. All interest rateswaps designated as fair valu
e hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fairvalues of these interes
t rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. These derivatives will mature ondates ranging from April 2023 to Apr
il 2024.Cash Flow Hedges
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecastedpayments of principal and 
interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated othercomprehensive loss which is subsequen
tly reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. These derivatives willmature on dates ranging f
rom April 2022 to March 2034.62

Net Investment HedgesThe Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investmentsof certain of its for
eign operations. The Company records changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Thesederivatives, which rela
te to the Company's operations in the United Kingdom held for sale as of January 31, 2021, have maturity dates ranging from October 2023to February 2030. The Company also designat
ed certain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the netinvestment of the Company's oper
ations in the United Kingdom and Japan, both of which were classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021. The Companyrecords foreign curren
cy gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, theCompany had $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion, r
espectively, of outstanding long-term debt designated as net investment hedges.These derivative and non-de
rivative gains or losses continue to defer in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the sale or substantial liquidation of theseforeign operations. Refer 
to Note 12  for additional detai l regarding the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan.Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted f
or under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequencesattributable to differences bet
ween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporarydifferences"). Deferred tax a
ssets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to berecovered or settled. The
 effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.Deferred tax assets ar
e evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.Many factors are conside
red when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,expectations of future taxa
ble income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets isevaluated by assessin
g the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operatingearnings and available 
tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") con
tains a provision which subjects a U.S. parent of a foreign subsidiary to current U.S. tax on its globalintangible low–taxed incom
e (“GILTI”). The GILTI income is eligible for a deduction, which lowers the effective tax rate to 10.5% for calendar years 2018through 2025 and 13.125% after 2025. The Company wil
l report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is notproviding deferred taxes 
for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI.In determining the provis
ion for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and taxincome, and statutory inco
me tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.The Company records a liabil
ity for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Companyrecords interest and pen
alties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, inthe Company's Consolidated Statemen
ts of Income. Refer to Note 9  for additional income tax disclosures.Revenue Recognition
    Net Sales
The Company recognizes sales r
evenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer. eCommerce salesinclude shipping revenue and a
re recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membe
rship fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months.Membership fee revenue was $1.7 b
illion for fiscal 2021, $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020 and $1.4 billion for fiscal 2019, respectively. Membership fee revenue isincluded in membership and o
ther income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accruedliabilities in the Comp
any's Consolidated Balance Sheets.63

Gift CardsCustomer purchases of gift c
ards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards inthe U.S. and some countries do not car
ry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and servicesindefinitely. Gift ca
rds in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, acertain number of gif
t cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizesrevenue for these amounts 
in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.Financial and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue 
from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component ofnet sales in the Company's Consolidat
ed Statements of Income.Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actua
l product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost oftransportation from th
e Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and importdistribution centers. Cost of s
ales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consider
ation from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specificprograms such as markdowns, margin p
rotection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost ofsales, except in cert
ain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company'sConsolidated Statements of In
come when the related inventory is sold.Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, genera
l and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, themajority of the cost of wa
rehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating,selling, general and adm
inistrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments'distribution facili
ties in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may includeall costs related to their di
stribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed 
as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general andadministrative expens
es in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific,incremental and identifiable adverti
sing costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.Advertising costs were $3.2 billion, $3.7 b
illion and $3.5 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities
 of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balancesheet date. Related tr
anslation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements ofIncome of all intern
ational subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered bythe income statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Instruments
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measur ement of expected credit losses ofcertain financia
l instruments. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2020 with no material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.64

Note 2. Net Income Per Common ShareBasic net income per com
mon share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted netincome per common share 
attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutiveeffect of share-bas
ed awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation ofdiluted net income per 
common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.The following table provides a

The Company has awarded share-based 
compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for allstock incentive plans, inc
luding expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was$1.2 billion, $0.9 billion and $0.8 bill
ion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating,selling, general and adm
inistrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-basedcompensation was $0.3 billion, $0.2 bil
lion and $0.2 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by awa

rized as follows:•
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provid e rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2020, restricted stockunits generally vest at 
a rate of 25% each year over a four  year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50% of restricted stock unitsgenerally vested three years
 from the grant date and the remaining 50% were vested five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stockunit is determined on the d
ate of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratablyover the vesting period. The exp
ected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for thedividend yield used to deter
mine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 4.4%, 4.9% and 7.2%, respectively.65

•Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards ar e for shares that vest based on the passage of time and includerestrictions related to employme
nt. Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria andmay range from 0% to 150% of 
the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one  and three years. Restricted stockand performance-based 
restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated BalanceSheets. The fair value of r
estricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value ofperformance-based r
estricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yieldthrough the vesting period and is 
recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair valueof performance-based 
restricted stock units in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 4.5%, 5.1% and 6.2%, respectively.In addition to the Plan, Flipkar
t has certain share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued.Share-based compensation exp
ense associated with these plans is included in the Other line in the table above.The following table shows the act

Assets and liabilities r
ecorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of thefair value hierarchy are:
•
Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and•
Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.The Company measures the fai
r value of equity investments on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of theCompany's equity investments with r
eadily determinable fair values are as follows:(Amounts in millions)

DerivativesThe Company also has derivatives 
recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination ofthe related deriva
tive agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include therelevant interest 
rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivativeswere as follows:

lance Sheets.Approximately $456 million of cash flow hedges were classified in deferred income taxes and other and $62 million of cash flow were classified in other long-term assets 
in the Company'sConsolidated Balance Sheets.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and li
abilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair valuemeasurements. General
ly, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.As further discussed in 
Note 12 , the Company's operations in Argentin a, Japan and the U.K. met the held for sale criteria in fiscal 2021. As a result, the individualdisposal groups were measured a
t fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement based on each transaction’s expectedconsideration. The carry
ing value of the Argentina, Japan and U.K. disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell, and as a result, the Companyrecognized non-recurr
ing impairment charges. The aggregate pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion associated with the divestiture of these operations in the WalmartInternational segmen
t was recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended January 31, 2021 and included theseimpairment charges 
as well as a $2.3 billion charge related to the Asda pension plan. These impairment charges include the anticipated release of non-cashcumulative foreign cu
rrency translation losses associated with the disposal groups. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurringbasis during fiscal 2021 were i
mmaterial.For the fiscal year ended J
anuary 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis primarilyrelated to the following:
•
in the Walmart U.S. segment, $0.5 billion in impairment charges for impaired assets consisting primarily of trade names and acquired developed softwaredue to strategic decis
ions that resulted in the write-down of certain eCommerce assets; and•
in the Walmart International segment, $0.4 billion in impairment charges consisting primarily of the write-off of the carrying value of one of Flipkart'stwo fashion trade names, Jabong.co
m, as a result of a strategic decision to focus on the Myntra.com fashion platform.These impairment cha
rges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Otherimpairment charges 
for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2020 were immaterial.For the fiscal year ended J
anuary 31, 2019, the Company sold the majority stake in Walmart Brazil during fiscal 2019 as discussed in Note 12 . The assets of the disposal group totaled $3.3 bill
ion and were comprised of $1.0 billion in current assets, $1.6 billion in property and equipment and property under capital lease andfinancing obligations, net, 
and $0.7 billion of other long-term assets. When measured as held for sale, these assets were fully impaired as the carrying value of thedisposal group exceeded the f
air value, less costs to sell and contributed to a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion in the Walmart International segment, which wasrecorded in other gains and 
losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. Other impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on anonrecurring basis during fis
cal 2019 were immaterial.Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equ
ivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fairvalue due to their short-
term maturities.(1)(2)

The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing ratefor similar types of bor
rowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows:

$ 6,858 $ 4,915 $ 4,281 In December 2017, the Tax Act was ena
cted and significantly changed U.S. income tax law. Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory taxrate and created new t
axes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new taxon global intangible low-tax
ed income ("GILTI"). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreignsubsidiary earnings not previous
ly subject to U.S. income tax.The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bull
etin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("SAB 118"), which allowed companies to record provis
ional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactmentand the complexity involved 
in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts inits financial stat
ements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance tocertain income tax 
effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.  Managementcompleted the Company's accoun
ting for tax reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidanceissued by the IRS could impact the 
aforementioned amounts in future periods. In fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442 million of additional tax expense relatedto the Tax Act, included as a co
mponent of provision for income taxes.One-time Transition Tax
The Tax Act required the Company to p
ay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of15.5% to the extent of fore
ign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0% on the remaining earnings. The Company calculatedthe transition tax li
ability and increased the provisional amount by $413 million, with the increase included as a component of provision for income taxes in fiscal2019.

Unremitted EarningsPrior to the Tax Act, the Company asse
rted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TaxAct, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on 
the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally befree of U.S. federal tax, but 
may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.  As of January 31, 2021, the Company has not recorded approximately $2billion of deferred t
ax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income andwithholding taxes would be due upon repat
riation.Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
As of January 31, 2021, the Company's net operat
ing loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $38.4 billion. Of these carryforwards,approximately $26.4 billion wi
ll expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2041. The remaining carryforwards have no expiration.The recoverability of 
these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, includingtaxable income in prior carry
back years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To theextent the Company does not conside
r it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To theextent that a valuat
ion allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, thechange in the valuation a
llowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.The Company had valuation allowanc
es of $8.8 billion and $8.6 billion as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarilywith the net operating loss c
arryforwards. Activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2021 related to valuation allowance builds in multiple markets, as wellas releases due to the exp
iration of underlying deferred tax assets.Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncerta
in tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probabilitythat the uncertain t
ax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of gross unr
ecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $3.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.The amount of unrecognized t
ax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion as of January 31, 2021 and2020, respectively.
A reconciliation of gross unr
ecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: 
Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)
2021 2020 2019 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year
$ 1,817 $ 1,305 $ 1,010 Increases related to prior year tax positions
92 516 620 Decreases related to prior year tax positions
(264) (15) (107) Increases related to current year tax positions
1,582 66 203 Settlements during the period
(64) (29) (390) Lapse in statutes of limitations
(28) (26) (31) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year
$ 3,135 $ 1,817 $ 1,305 The Company classifies inte
rest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses,respectively. Inter
est expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. During the next twelve months, it isreasonably possible that t
ax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained onaudit or because the Company ag
rees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible. As a result of theseefforts, unrecognized t
ax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months. The Company does not expect anychange to have a mater
ial impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company remains subject to 
income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2014, and 2018 through 2021. The Company alsoremains subject to inco
me tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 2021, and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for thefiscal years ended 2013 through 2021. 
With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by taxauthorities for years b
efore fiscal 2012.74

Other TaxesThe Company is subject to tax exa
minations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing invarious jurisdictions. In c
ertain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unlessotherwise indicated, the poss
ible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, ifdecided adversely to the Comp
any, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.Note 10. Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of 
legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflectedin the Company's Consolidated Financia
l Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore anaccrual has not been mad
e. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter intodiscussions regarding settl
ement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and itsshareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the m
atters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liabilitymaterial to the Company's 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Asda Equal Value Claims
Asda, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which was so
ld in February 2021, is a defendant in over 40,000 "equal value" claims that began in 2008 and areproceeding before an Employ
ment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") on behalf of current and former Asdastore employees, and furth
er claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equalvalue in terms of, among oth
er things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and thatthe difference in pay b
etween these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses anddistribution facili
ties, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in thewarehouse and distribution fa
cilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.In October 2016, following a preli
minary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those ofemployees in Asda's warehouse and dist
ribution facilities. Asda appealed the ruling and is awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court of the U.K.Notwithstanding the appeal, cl
aimants are now proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by theclaimants is of equal v
alue to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities.The Company cannot predict the nu
mber of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from theseproceedings. Accordingly, the Company 
can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business,financial position, resu
lts of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defensesto these claims, and int
ends to defend the claims vigorously. Following the sale of Asda described in Note 12 , the Company will continue to conduc t the defense ofthese claims. While po
tential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to these claims up to acontractually determined amount.
Opioids Litigation
In December 2017, the United Stat
es Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by variousplaintiffs, including coun
ties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning theimpacts of widespread opioid 
abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Lit igation (MDL No. 2804), and is pending in the U.S. District Court for th
e Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrictlitigation. Similar 
cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs.Plaintiffs are seeking 
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement.  The Company cannot predict the number of suchclaims that may be f
iled, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company hasalso been responding to subpoenas, info
rmation requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing anddistribution practic
es involving opioids. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District ofTexas against the U.S. Department o
f Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles andresponsibilities of phar
macists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). The Company’saction was dismissed and the Company 
is appealing the decision. On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Delaware alleging tha
t the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled75

substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violationsof the CSA. The DOJ is seeking civil penalti
es and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. In addition,the Company is the subject of two se
curities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect toopioids, filed in the U.S. District Cour
t for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors whoacquired Walmart s
tock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. A derivative action was also filed by one of the Company's shareholders in the U.S.District Court for the Distr
ict of Delaware on February 9, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect tooversight of the Company’s distr
ibution and dispensing of opioids.The Company cannot reasonably est
imate any loss or range of loss that may arise from the various Opioids Litigation and intends to vigorously defend theselitigation matte
rs. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business,financial position, resu
lts of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.Note 11. Retirement-Related Benefi
tsThe Company offers a 401(k) plan fo
r associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. TheCompany also offers a 401(k) type p
lan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Underthese plans, after one ye
ar of employment, the Company matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matchingcontributions immedia
tely vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits.Associates in internation
al countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans areadministered based upon the 
legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established.The following table summar
izes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:Fiscal Years Ended January 31,

in the United Kingdom has a sponsored defined benefit pension plan. In October 2019, Asda, Walmart and the Trustee ofthe Asda Group Pension Scheme (the "Plan") en
tered into an agreement pursuant to which Asda made a cash contribution of $1.0 billion to the Plan (the "AsdaPension Contribution") which enabled th
e Plan to purchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants. The agreement between Asda,Walmart and the Trust
ee of the Plan contemplates that subsequent to the purchase of the bulk annuity insurance contract by the Plan, each of the Plan participantswill be issued an individual annu
ity contract. The issuer of the individual annuity insurance contracts will be solely responsible for paying each participant’sbenefits in full and will 
release the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. In connection with the sale of Asda, all accumulated pension components of $2.3billion were included in th
e disposal group and the estimated pre-tax loss recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as discussed in Note 8  and Note 12 . 76

Note 12. Disposals, Acquisitions and Related ItemsThe following disposals and acquisi
tions impact the Company's Walmart International segment.Walmart Argentina

Walmart BrazilIn August 2018, the Company sold an 80 percent st
ake of Walmart Brazil to Advent International ("Advent"). Under the terms of the sale, Advent agreed tocontribute additional capital t
o the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters.As a result, the Company recorded 
a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion during fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement ofIncome. Substantially al
l of this charge was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 upon meeting the held for sale criteria. In calculating the loss, the fairvalue of the disposal group was redu
ced by $0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferredincome taxes and other in 
the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax andlegal contingencies and o
ther matters for up to R$2.3 billion, adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate.The Company deconsolidated the f
inancial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percentownership interest using the equ
ity method of accounting. This equity method investment was determined to have no fair value and continues to have no carryingvalue.
Flipkart
In August 2018, the Company acquired 81 perc
ent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an eCommerce marketplace in India,for cash consideration of 
approximately $16 billion. The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. In the second quarterof fiscal 2020, the Company fina
lized the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Flipkart acquisition as follows:•
Assets of $24.1 billion, which comprise primarily of $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion in other current assets, $5.0 billion inintangible assets and $13.5 bil
lion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life,which were estimated using th
e income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate toacquired technology with a l
ife of 3 years. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scaleprimarily relat
ed to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes;•
Liabilities of $3.7 billion, which comprise primarily of $1.8 billion of current liabilities and $1.7 billion of deferred income taxes; and•
Noncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion, for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The Company began consolidating the 
financial statements of Flipkart in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, using a one-month lag. To finance the acquisition, theCompany used a combination of cash p
rovided by long-term debt as discussed in Note 6  and cash on hand. The Flipkart resul ts of operations since acquisition andthe pro forma financial informati
on are immaterial.Note 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the opera
tion of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, CentralAmerica, Chile, China, India and M
exico. The Company also engaged in operations in Japan and the United Kingdom, both of which were classified as held forsale as of January 31, 2021, and subsequent
ly sold in February 2021 and March 2021, respectively. The Company also operated in Argentina prior to the sale ofWalmart Argentina in Nove
mber 2020 and in Brazil prior to sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12  for discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's opera
tions are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company definesits segments as those opera
tions whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. TheCompany sells similar indiv
idual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individualproducts and services.
The Walmart U.S. segment inc
ludes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The WalmartInternational segmen
t consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segmentincludes the warehouse memb
ership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overheadand other items not allo
cated to any of the Company's segments.The Company measures the resul
ts of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporateoverhead allocations. From 
time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations,as determined by the info
rmation regularly78

reviewed by its CODM. Beginning with the first quarter in fiscal 2021, the Company revised its definition of eCommerce net sales to include certain pharmacytransactions, and accord
ingly, revised prior period amounts to maintain comparability. Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate andsupport, including the reconc

ITEM 9.CHANGES IN AND DISAGREE MENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURENone.
ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosur
e controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, isaccumulated and commun
icated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls andprocedures, no matter how well d
esigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management isnecessarily required 
to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control ormanage those entities, ou
r controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to ourconsolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controlsand increase efficiency, w
hile ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new,more efficient syst
ems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared servicesorganizations and incre
asing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company'sinternal control over 
financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internalcontrol environment re
mains effective.An evaluation of the effe
ctiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report wasperformed under the superv
ision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon thatevaluation, our Chief Execut
ive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonableassurance that inform
ation required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, isaccumulated and commun
icated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisionsregarding required disc
losure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within thetime periods specifi
ed by the SEC's rules and forms.Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management has respon
sibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is aprocess designed to
 provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reportingpurposes in accordance with a
ccounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financialreporting may not prevent o
r detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as ofJanuary 31, 2021. In making its assessm
ent, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of theTreadway Commission in Interna
l Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control overfinancial reporting was 
effective as of January 31, 2021. The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, has been audited byErnst & Young LLP as stated in their r
eport which appears herein.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in the Comp
any's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely tomaterially affect, the Company
's internal control over financial reporting.ITEM 9B.
