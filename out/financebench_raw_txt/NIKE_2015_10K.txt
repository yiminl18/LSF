PART I  
ITEM 1. Business  
   
NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this report, the  terms “we,” “us,” “NIKE,” and the “Company” refer to NIKE, 
Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affilia tes, collectively, unless the context indicates oth erwise. Our NIKE e-commerce website is located at www.nike.com. 
On our NIKE corporate website, located at news.nike.com, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably  practicable after they are electronically filed wi th or 
furnished to the United States Securities and Excha nge Commission (the “SEC”): our annual report on Fo rm 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10- Q, our current 
reports on Form 8- K and any amendments to those reports filed or furn ished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Sec urities and Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended. Our definitive Proxy Statements are also p osted on our corporate website. All such filings on  our corporate website are available free of charge . Copies of 
these filings may also be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, N E, Washington, D.C. 20549, or by calling the SEC at  1-800-
SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website ( www.sec.gov ) that contains current, quarterly and annual repor ts, proxy and information statements and 
other information regarding issuers that file elect ronically. Also available on our corporate website are the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, as 
well as our corporate governance guidelines and cod e of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits  a request 
in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman  Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453.  
Our principal business activity is the design, deve lopment and worldwide marketing and selling of athl etic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. 
NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and  apparel in the world. We sell our products to reta il accounts, through NIKE- owned retail stores and internet 
websites (which we refer to as our “Direct to Consumer” or "DTC" operations), and through a mix of independ ent distributors and licensees throughout the world . 
Virtually all of our products are manufactured by i ndependent contractors. Practically all footwear an d apparel products are produced outside the United States, 
while equipment products are produced both in the U nited States and abroad.  
   
We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in eight key categories: Running, Basketball, Football (Socc er), Men’s Training, Women’ s Training, Action Sports, 
Sportswear (our sports- inspired lifestyle products) and Golf. Basketball i ncludes our Jordan Brand product offerings and Men' s Training includes our baseball and 
American football product offerings. We also market  products designed for kids, as well as for other a thletic and recreational uses such as cricket, lacr osse, tennis, 
volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activiti es.  
NIKE’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily  for specific athletic use, although a large percen tage of the products are worn for casual or leisure  
purposes. We place considerable emphasis on high- quality construction and innovation in our products . Sportswear, Running, Basketball and Football (Soc cer) are 
currently our top-selling footwear categories and w e expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales .  
We sell sports apparel covering most of the above- mentioned categories, which feature the same tradem arks and are sold predominantly through the same 
marketing and distribution channels as athletic foo twear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athlet ic use and 
exemplifies our commitment to innovation and high-q uality construction. Sportswear, Men's Training, Ru nning and Football (Soccer) are currently our top- selling 
apparel categories and we expect them to continue t o lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by 
category. We also market apparel with licensed coll ege and professional team and league logos.  
We sell a line of performance equipment and accesso ries under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, soc ks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devic es, bats, 
gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also s ell small amounts of various plastic products to ot her 
manufacturers through our wholly owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc.  
Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessori es predominantly focused on Basketball using the Ju mpman 
trademark. Sales and operating results for the Jord an Brand are included within the NIKE Brand Basketb all category and within the respective NIKE Brand 
geographic operating segments.  
One of our wholly owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California (“Hurley”),  designs and distributes a line of action sports and  youth 
lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley a re included within the NIKE Brand Action Sports cat egory and 
within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic op erating segment, respectively.  
Another of our wholly owned subsidiary brands, Conv erse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts ( “Converse”), designs, distributes and licenses casual 
sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Convers e, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron a nd Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of th e 
Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.   
In addition to the products we sell to our wholesal e customers and directly to consumers through our D TC operations, we have also entered into license ag reements 
that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and  sell, using NIKE- owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment 
designed for sports activities.  
On February 1, 2013, and November 30, 2012, we comp leted the divestitures of the Cole Haan and Umbro b usinesses, respectively, allowing us to better focu s our 
resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Hu rley and Converse brands.

Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 18 — Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sa les volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slight ly exceeded 
those in the second and third quarters. However, th e mix of product sales may vary considerably as a r esult of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for 
particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment , as well as other macroeconomic, operating and log istics-related factors.  
Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the re lative popularity of various sports and fitness act ivities and changing design trends affect the deman d for our 
products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and  shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mi x of existing product offerings, developing new pro ducts, 
styles and categories and influencing sports and fi tness preferences through extensive marketing. Fail ure to respond in a timely and adequate manner coul d have a 
material adverse effect on our sales and profitabil ity. This is a continuing risk. We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic 
organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates pr edominantly in one industry: the design, developmen t, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, appa rel, 
equipment, accessories and services. Our reportable  operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North A merica, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, 
Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE  Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed wi thin each geographic operating segment.  
Converse is also a reportable segment, and operates  in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accesso ries.  
For both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 , NIKE Brand a nd Converse sales in the United States accounted fo r approximately 46% of total revenues, compared to 45% for 
fiscal 2013 . We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts i n the United States, including a mix of footwear 
stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty s tores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf sh ops and other retail accounts. In the United States , we utilize 
NIKE sales offices to solicit sales as well as inde pendent sales representatives to sell specialty pro ducts for golf and skateboarding. During fiscal 201 5 , our three 
largest customers accounted for approximately 26% o f sales in the United States.  
We make substantial use of our futures ordering pro gram, which allows retailers to order five to six m onths in advance of delivery with the commitment th at their 
orders will be delivered within a set time period a t a fixed price. In fiscal 2015 , 87% of our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments (excluding  NIKE Golf, Hurley and 
Converse) were made under the futures program, comp ared to 86% in fiscal 2014 and 87% in fiscal 2013 .  In fiscal 2015 , 67% of our U.S. wholesale apparel 
shipments (excluding NIKE Golf, Hurley and Converse ) were made under the futures program, compared to 71% in fiscal 2014 and 67% in fiscal 2013 .  
Our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand p roducts, including Jordan Brand and Hurley, to cons umers through our e-commerce website, www.nike.com . 
We also sell Converse products to consumers through  a Converse owned e-commerce website, www.converse.com . In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations 
sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States:  
NIKE owns a full product line distribution center l ocated in Memphis, Tennessee. In addition, NIKE has  four other distribution centers, three of which ar e leased, also 
located in Memphis. NIKE Brand apparel and equipmen t products are also shipped from our leased Foothil l Ranch, California distribution center. Converse a nd 
Hurley products are shipped primarily from leased f acilities in Ontario, California.  
For both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 , non-U.S. NIK E Brand and Converse sales accounted for 54% of tot al revenues, compared with 55% for fiscal 2013 . We sell 
our products to retail accounts, through our own Di rect to Consumer operations and through a mix of in dependent distributors, licensees and sales represe ntatives 
around the world. We sell to thousands of retail ac counts and ship products from 45 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, 
including Canada, Asia, some Latin American countri es and Europe, we have a futures ordering program f or retailers similar to the United States futures o rdering 
program described above. During fiscal 2015 , NIKE’ s three largest customers outside of the United Sta tes accounted for approximately 12% of total non- U.S. sales. 
Our Direct to Consumer business operates the follow ing number of retail stores outside the United Stat es, in addition to NIKE and Converse owned e- commerce 
websites in over 25 countries:

No customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldw ide net sales during fiscal 2015 .  
Worldwide futures orders for NIKE Brand athletic fo otwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from Jun e through November 2015, were $13.5 billion compare d with 
$13.3 billion for the same period last year. This f utures orders amount is calculated based upon our f orecast of the actual currency exchange rates under  which our 
revenues will be translated during this period. Rep orted futures orders are not necessarily indicative  of our expectation of revenues for this period. Th is is because 
the mix of orders can shift between futures and at- once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these  futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled t ime period 
noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange  rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of d iscounts, order cancellations and returns can cause  differences in 
the comparisons between futures orders and actual r evenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at- once and closeout 
sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Cons umer operations and sales from our Converse, Hurley  and 
NIKE Golf businesses.  
We believe our research, design and development eff orts are key factors in our success. Technical inno vation in the design and manufacturing process of f ootwear, 
apparel and athletic equipment receive continued em phasis as NIKE strives to produce products that hel p to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury an d 
maximize comfort while reducing waste.  
In addition to NIKE’ s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomecha nics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related 
fields, we also utilize research committees and adv isory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers , equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and  other 
experts who consult with us and review designs, mat erials, concepts for product and manufacturing proc ess improvements and compliance with product safety  
regulations around the world. Employee athletes, at hletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and  other athletes wear- test and evaluate products during the 
design and development process.  
As we continue to develop new technologies, NIKE is  simultaneously focused on the design of innovative  products incorporating such technologies throughou t our 
product categories. Using market intelligence and r esearch, the various NIKE design teams identify opp ortunities to leverage new technologies in existing  categories 
responding to consumer preferences. The proliferati on of NIKE Air, Lunar, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri- Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave and NIKE+ technologies throu gh Running, 
Basketball, Men's Training, Women's Training and Sp ortswear, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.  
We are supplied by approximately 146 footwear facto ries located in 14 countries. The largest single fo otwear factory accounted for approximately 7% of to tal fiscal 
2015 NIKE Brand footwear production. Virtually all of ou r footwear is manufactured outside of the United St ates by independent contract manufacturers who ofte n 
operate multiple factories. In fiscal 2015 , contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesi a manufactured approximately 43%, 32% and 20% of to tal NIKE Brand 
footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina,  Brazil, India and Mexico to manufacture footwear f or sale 
primarily within those countries. In fiscal 2015 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production, and in agg regate 
accounted for approximately 69% of NIKE Brand footw ear production.  
We are supplied by approximately 408 apparel factor ies located in 39 countries. The largest single app arel factory accounted for approximately 11% of tot al fiscal 
2015 NIKE Brand apparel production. Virtually all of our  apparel is manufactured outside of the United Stat es by independent contract manufacturers which ofte n 
operate multiple factories. In fiscal 2015 , most of this apparel production occurred in China , Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia  and Cambodia. In 
fiscal 2015 , one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more th an 10% of apparel production, and the top five cont ract manufacturers in aggregate accounted 
for approximately 36% of NIKE Brand apparel product ion.  
The principal materials used in our footwear produc ts are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compou nds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthet ic leather, 
nylon, polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethan e films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning compo nents. During fiscal 2015 , NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholl y-owned 
subsidiary of NIKE, Inc., with facilities near Beav erton, Oregon and in St. Louis, Missouri, and indep endent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our l argest 
suppliers of the Air- Sole cushioning components used in footwear. The pr incipal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads 
(both virgin and recycled); specialized performance  fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away  from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or s now; and 
plastic and metal hardware. NIKE’ s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw mat erials for the manufacturing of our footwear, appar el and equipment 
products. Most raw materials are available and purc hased by those independent contractors and supplier s in the countries where manufacturing takes place.  NIKE's 
independent contract manufacturers and suppliers ha ve thus far experienced little difficulty in satisf ying raw material requirements for the production o f our products.

Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (“Sojitz America”), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner  of our redeemable preferred stock, has 
performed significant import-export financing servi ces for us. During fiscal 2015 , Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand 
products sold in certain NIKE markets including Arg entina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa and Thailand, excludi ng products 
produced and sold in the same country. Approximatel y 8% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countrie s. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these s ervices 
or any failure of Sojitz America’ s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire produc ts from our suppliers and to deliver products to ou r customers in those markets. 
Such a disruption could result in canceled orders t hat would adversely affect sales and profitability.  However, we believe that any such disruption would  be short-
term in duration due to the ready availability of a lternative sources of financing at competitive rate s. Our current agreements with Sojitz America expir e on May 31, 
2018, and contain a provision allowing us to extend  the agreements to May 31, 2019.  
Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business ab road, such as possible increases in import duties, anti-dumping 
measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restric tions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, i n certain parts of the world, political instability  and terrorism. We 
have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of suc h material effects occurring in the future.  
In recent years, uncertain global and regional econ omic conditions have affected international trade a nd caused a rise in protectionist actions around th e 
world. These trends are affecting many global manuf acturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Com panies 
in our industry are facing trade protectionism in m any different regions, and in nearly all cases we a re working together with industry groups to address  trade issues 
and reduce the impact to the industry, while observ ing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding ou r efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in 
the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or  profitability for NIKE as well as the imported foo twear and 
apparel industry as a whole.  
We monitor protectionist trends and developments th roughout the world that may materially impact our i ndustry, and we engage in administrative and judici al 
processes to mitigate trade restrictions. In Brazil  and Argentina, we are actively participating in du mping investigations against footwear from China an d actively 
monitoring actions in other countries that may resu lt in additional anti- dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating 
against other impediments that may limit or delay c ustoms clearance for imports of footwear, apparel a nd equipment. Moreover, with respect to trade restr ictions 
targeting China, which represents an important sour cing country and consumer market for us, we are wor king with a broad coalition of global businesses an d trade 
associations representing a wide variety of sectors  to help ensure that any legislation enacted and im plemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concern s, (ii) is 
consistent with international trade rules, and (iii ) reflects and considers China's domestic economy a nd the important role it has in the global economic  community.  
Where trade protection measures are implemented, we  believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of s upply for 
the products obtained from our present suppliers. I f events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operatio ns could be 
temporarily disrupted and we could experience an ad verse financial impact. However, we believe we coul d abate any such disruption, and that much of the a dverse 
impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-te rm nature, although alternate sources of supply mig ht not be as cost- effective and could have an ongoing adverse 
impact on profitability.  
NIKE advocates for trade liberalization for footwea r and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral  free trade agreements. The passage of Trade Promot ion 
Authority in the United States will enable the conc lusion of the Trans -Pacific Partnership (TPP). If ultimately passed, th e TPP has the potential to reduce or eliminate 
high rates of customs duties for imports into the U nited States of NIKE products sourced from TPP coun tries (primarily footwear and apparel from Vietnam and 
apparel from Malaysia). Similarly, the European Uni on is close to concluding a free trade agreement wi th Vietnam that could lead to duty reduction or eli mination for 
footwear and apparel.  
The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment indust ry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We c ompete internationally with a significant number of  athletic 
and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisur e apparel companies, sports equipment companies and  large companies having diversified lines of athlet ic and 
leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, V.F. Co rp., Under Armour and UNIQLO, among others. The int ense 
competition and the rapid changes in technology and  consumer preferences in the markets for athletic a nd leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equip ment, 
constitute significant risk factors in our operatio ns.  
NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear, ap parel and equipment in the world. Important aspects  of competition in this industry are:  
We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.  
We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products  and believe having distinctive marks that are read ily identifiable is an important factor in creating  a market for our 
goods, in identifying our brands and the Company an d in distinguishing our goods from the goods of oth ers. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design tradema rks 
to be among our most valuable assets and we have re gistered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictio ns worldwide. In addition, we own many other tradem arks 
that we utilize in marketing our products. We own c ommon law rights in the trade dress of several sign ificant shoe designs and elements. For certain trad e dress, we 
have sought and obtained trademark registrations.  
NIKE has copyright protection in its design, graphi cs and other original works. When appropriate, we h ave sought registrations for this content.

NIKE owns patents, and has a patent license, facili tating its use of “Air” technologies. The "Air" process utilizes pressurize d gas encapsulated in polyurethane. Some 
of the early patents directed to the “Air” technologies have expired, which may enable competi tors to use certain types of similar technology. Su bsequent NIKE 
patents directed to the “Air” technologies will not  expire for several years.  
We also file and maintain many U.S. and foreign uti lity patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign desi gn patents protecting components, manufacturing tec hniques, 
features and industrial design used in various athl etic and leisure footwear, apparel, athletic equipm ent, digital devices and golf products. These paten ts expire at 
various times; and patents issued for original appl ications filed this calendar year in the United Sta tes may last until 2030 for design patents and unti l 2035 for utility 
patents.  
We believe our success depends primarily upon our c apabilities in areas such as design, research and d evelopment, production and marketing rather than 
exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positi ons. However, we have followed a policy of filing p atent applications for the United States and select  foreign 
countries on inventions, designs and improvements t hat we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorousl y protect our trademarks and patents against third- party 
infringement.  
As of May 31, 2015 , we had approximately 62,600 employee s worldwide, including retail and part- time employees. Management considers its relationsh ip with 
employees to be excellent. None of our employees ar e represented by a union, except for certain employ ees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law 
requires those employees to be represented by a tra de union. Also, in some countries outside of the Un ited States, local laws require employee representa tion by 
works councils (which may be entitled to informatio n and consultation on certain Company decisions) or  by organizations similar to a union. In certain Eu ropean 
countries, we are required by local law to enter in to and/or comply with industry- wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a 
material interruption of operations due to labor di sagreements.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  
Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements a nd Analyst Reports  
Certain written and oral statements, other than pur ely historic information, including estimates, proj ections, statements relating to NIKE’ s business plans, objectives 
and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or inco rporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its 
representatives in this report, other reports, fili ngs with the SEC, press releases, conferences or ot herwise, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of 
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 199 5 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of  1934, as amended. Forward- looking statements include, 
without limitation, any statement that may predict,  forecast, indicate or imply future results, perfor mance or achievements, and may contain the words “believe,”
“anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “wil l be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” or wor ds or phrases of similar meaning. Forward- looking statements involve 
risks and uncertainties which may cause actual resu lts to differ materially from the forward- looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are  detailed from time to 
time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, includi ng reports filed on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10- K, and include, among others, the following: intern ational, national and 
local general economic and market conditions; the s ize and growth of the overall athletic footwear, ap parel and equipment markets; intense competition am ong 
designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of a thletic footwear, apparel and equipment for consume rs and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in 
consumer preferences; popularity of particular desi gns, categories of products and sports; seasonal an d geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties  in 
anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer pre ferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the  various market factors described above; difficulti es in 
implementing, operating and maintaining NIKE’ s increasingly complex information systems and cont rols, including, without limitation, the systems re lated to demand 
and supply planning and inventory control; interrup tions in data and information technology systems; c onsumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting 
operating results, including, without limitation, t he fact that advance futures orders may not be indi cative of future revenues due to changes in shipmen t timing, the 
changing mix of futures and at- once orders, and discounts, order cancellations and  returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or  forecast its growth and 
inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE’s products; increases in the cost of materials, lab or and energy used to manufacture products; new 
product development and introduction; the ability t o secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and qual ity; 
customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of si gnificant customers or suppliers; dependence on dis tributors and licensees; business disruptions; incr eased costs 
of freight and transportation to meet delivery dead lines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decl ine in NIKE's debt ratings; changes in business str ategy or 
development plans; general risks associated with do ing business outside the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, imp ort duties, 
tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability  and terrorism; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal develop ments relating 
to, climate change; natural disasters; liability an d other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability t o attract and retain qualified personnel; the effec ts of NIKE's 
decision to invest in or divest of businesses and o ther factors referenced or incorporated by referenc e in this report and other reports.  
The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other s ections of this report may include additional facto rs which could adversely affect NIKE’ s business and financial 
performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very comp etitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks  emerge from time to time and it is not possible fo r 
management to predict all such risks, nor can it as sess the impact of all such risks on NIKE’ s business or the extent to which any risk, or comb ination of risks, may 
cause actual results to differ materially from thos e contained in any forward- looking statements. Given these risks and uncertain ties, investors should not place 
undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a p rediction of actual results.  
Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does , from time to time, communicate with securities an alysts, it is against NIKE’ s policy to disclose to them any 
material non- public information or other confidential commercial  information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or 
report issued by any analyst irrespective of the co ntent of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE  has a policy against issuing or confirming financi al forecasts or 
projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent t hat reports issued by securities analysts contain a ny projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports  are not the 
responsibility of NIKE.  
Our products face intense competition.  
NIKE is a consumer products company and the relativ e popularity of various sports and fitness activiti es and changing design trends affect the demand for  our 
products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipm ent industry is highly competitive in the United St ates and on a worldwide basis. We compete internati onally with 
a significant number of athletic and leisure footwe ar companies, athletic and leisure apparel companie s, sports equipment companies and large companies h aving 
diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear,  apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independen t 
manufacturers that produce our products.  
Product offerings, technologies, marketing expendit ures (including expenditures for advertising and en dorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer  service 
and social media presence are areas of intense comp etition. This, in addition to rapid changes in tech nology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic 
and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equi pment, constitute significant risk factors in our o perations. If we do not adequately and timely antic ipate and 
respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline  significantly.  
Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business.  
Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and o ur success depends on our ability to maintain and e nhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining,  
promoting and growing our brands will depend on our  design and marketing efforts, including advertisin g and consumer campaigns, product innovation and pr oduct 
quality. Our commitment to product innovation and q uality and our continuing investment in design (inc luding materials) and marketing may not have the de sired 
impact on our brand image and reputation. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of a ny of our 
brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity.  In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or  legal action against us could damage our reputatio n and brand 
image, undermine consumer confidence in us and redu ce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulator y or legal action is unfounded or not material to 
our operations.  
In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our abilit y to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment,  
including our increasing reliance on social media a nd online dissemination of advertising campaigns. N egative posts or comments about us on social networ king 
websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image. If we do not maintain, extend and expa nd our brand image, then our product sales, financi al 
condition and results of operations could be materi ally and adversely affected.

If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences  and develop new products, we may not be able to ma intain or 
increase our revenues and profits.  
Our success depends on our ability to identify, ori ginate and define product trends as well as to anti cipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demand s in a 
timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respo nd rapidly to new or changing product trends or con sumer 
preferences. All of our products are subject to cha nging consumer preferences that cannot be predicted  with certainty. Our new products may not receive c onsumer 
acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapi dly to different types of performance products or a way from these types of products altogether, and ou r future 
success depends in part on our ability to anticipat e and respond to these changes. If we fail to antic ipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts i n consumer 
preferences by adjusting the mix of existing produc t offerings, developing new products, designs, styl es and categories, and influencing sports and fitne ss 
preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower  profit margins, any of which could have an adverse  effect 
on our results of operations and financial conditio n. In addition, we market our products globally thr ough a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotio nal programs 
and campaigns, including social media and online ad vertising. If we do not successfully market our pro ducts or if advertising and promotional costs incre ase, these 
factors could have an adverse effect on our busines s, financial condition and results of operations.  
We rely on technical innovation and high-quality pr oducts to compete in the market for our products.  
Technical innovation and quality control in the des ign and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commerci al success 
of our products. Research and development plays a k ey role in technical innovation. We rely upon speci alists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, ex ercise 
physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustain ability and related fields, as well as research com mittees and advisory boards made up of athletes, co aches, 
trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatr ists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products. While we strive to produ ce 
products that help to enhance athletic performance,  reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, con sumer 
demand for our products could decline, and if we ex perience problems with the quality of our products,  we may incur substantial expense to remedy the pro blems.  
Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-qual ity endorsers of our products could harm our busine ss.  
We establish relationships with professional athlet es, sports teams and leagues to develop, evaluate a nd promote our products, as well as establish produ ct 
authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increas ed, the costs associated with establishing and reta ining such sponsorships and 
other relationships have increased. If we are unabl e to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or  to do so at a 
reasonable cost, we could lose the on- field authenticity associated with our products, an d we may be required to modify and substantially in crease our marketing 
investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues,  expenses and profitability could be harmed.  
Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop usin g our products contrary to their endorsement agreem ents, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, 
actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associa ted with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, could also seriou sly harm 
our brand image with consumers and, as a result, co uld have an adverse effect on our sales and financi al condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, 
a failure to continue to correctly identify promisi ng athletes to use and endorse our products, or a f ailure to enter into cost- effective endorsement arrangements with 
prominent athletes and sports organizations could a dversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.   
Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in  lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins  and earnings.  
A majority of our products are manufactured and sol d outside of the United States. As a result, we con duct purchase and sale transactions in various curr encies, 
which increases our exposure to fluctuations in for eign currency exchange rates globally. Our internat ional revenues and expenses generally are derived f rom sales 
and operations in foreign currencies, and these rev enues and expenses could be affected by currency fl uctuations, including amounts recorded in foreign c urrencies 
and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated f inancial reporting, as weakening of foreign currenc ies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects t he U.S. Dollar 
value of the Company's foreign currency- denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange r ate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of  the independent 
manufacturers that produce our products by making t heir purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctua tions 
have adversely affected, and could continue to have  an adverse effect on our results of operations and  financial condition.  
We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our  financial 
results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the nega tive impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trad ing currency, but 
they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U. S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future fin ancial results could be significantly affected by t he value of the 
U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies i n which we conduct business. The degree to which ou r financial results are affected for any given time  period will 
depend in part upon our hedging activities.

Global economic conditions could have a material ad verse effect on our business, operating results and  financial 
condition.  
The uncertain state of the global economy continues  to impact businesses around the world, and most ac utely in emerging markets and developing economies.  If 
global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors c ould have a material adverse effect on our business , operating 
results and financial condition:  
Our business is affected by seasonality, which coul d result in fluctuations in our operating results.  
We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sa les volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slight ly exceeded 
those in the second and third fiscal quarters. Howe ver, the mix of product sales may vary considerably  from time to time as a result of changes in season al and 
geographic demand for particular types of footwear,  apparel and equipment and in connection with the t iming of global sporting events, including without limitation 
the Olympics and the World Cup. In addition, our cu stomers may cancel orders, change delivery schedule s or change the mix of products ordered with minima l 
notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurate ly predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our re sults of operations are likely to fluctuate signifi cantly from period 
to period. This seasonality, along with other facto rs that are beyond our control, including general e conomic conditions, changes in consumer preferences , weather 
conditions, availability of import quotas, transpor tation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluct uations, could adversely affect our business and ca use our 
results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating m argins are also sensitive to a number of additional  factors that are beyond our control, including man ufacturing and 
transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix a nd geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period sh ould not be 
considered indicative of the results to be expected  for any future period.  
Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of  our future revenues.  
We make substantial use of our futures ordering pro gram, which allows retailers to order five to six m onths in advance of delivery with the commitment th at their 
orders will be delivered within a set period of tim e at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program al lows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, 
purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill custom er orders and the risk of non- delivery. We report changes in futures orders in ou r periodic financial reports. 
Although we believe futures orders are an important  indicator of our future revenues, reported futures  orders are not necessarily indicative of our expec tation of 
revenues for any future period. This is because the  mix of orders can shift between futures and at- once orders. In addition, foreign currency exchange  rate 
fluctuations, order cancellations, shipping timing,  returns and discounts can cause differences in the  comparisons between futures orders and actual reve nues. 
Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is n ot derived from futures orders, including at- once and closeout sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of 
NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Cons umer operations and sales from our Converse, Hurley  and NIKE Golf businesses.  
Our futures ordering program does not prevent exces s inventories or inventory shortages, which could r esult in 
decreased operating margins, cash flows and harm to  our business.  
We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of cust omer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to 
customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell  excess products ordered from manufacturers. Invent ory levels in excess of customer demand may result in 
inventory write- downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discount ed prices could significantly impair our brand imag e and have an adverse effect on our operating 
results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or i f our manufacturers fail to supply products we requ ire at the 
time we need them, we may experience inventory shor tages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to  customers, negatively impact retailer and distribu tor 
relationships and diminish brand loyalty.  
The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operati ons and financial condition from period to period. A failure to 
accurately predict the level of demand for our prod ucts could adversely affect our net revenues and ne t income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effe cts with any 
certainty in advance.  
 
8  •  Slower consumer spending may result in reduced dema nd for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenu es, 
higher discounts, increased inventories and lower g ross margins.  
•  In the future, we may be unable to access financing  in the credit and capital markets at reasonable ra tes in the event we find it desirable to do so. 
•  We conduct transactions in various currencies, whic h increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign  currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. 
Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exc hange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in  foreign currencies could have a significant impact  on our 
reported operating results and financial condition.   
•  Continued volatility in the availability and prices  for commodities and raw materials we use in our pr oducts and in our supply chain (such as cotton or p etroleum 
derivatives) could have a material adverse effect o n our costs, gross margins and profitability.  
•  If retailers of our products experience declining r evenues, or experience difficulty obtaining financi ng in the capital and credit markets to purchase ou r products, 
this could result in reduced orders for our product s, order cancellations, late retailer payments, ext ended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, re duced 
cash flows, greater expense associated with collect ion efforts and increased bad debt expense.  
•  If retailers of our products experience severe fina ncial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cea se business operations, which could negatively impa ct the 
sale of our products to consumers.  
•  If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficu lty obtaining financing in the capital and credit m arkets to 
purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipm ent and other general working capital needs, it may  result in delays or non- delivery of shipments of our 
products.

We may be adversely affected by the financial healt h of our retailers.  
We extend credit to our customers based on an asses sment of a customer’ s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of 
production and the shipping of seasonal products, w e offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures o rdering 
program. These advance orders may be canceled, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers stru ggling with 
economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers h ave experienced financial difficulties, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on 
receivables and our financial condition. When the r etail economy weakens, retailers may be more cautio us with orders. A slowing economy in our key market s could 
adversely affect the financial health of our custom ers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, 
product sales are dependent in part on high quality  merchandising and an appealing store environment t o attract consumers, which requires continuing inve stments 
by retailers. Retailers that experience financial d ifficulties may fail to make such investments or de lay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for o ur products.  
Consolidation of retailers or concentration of reta il market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our 
credit risk, and impair our ability to sell product s.  
The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail  markets in some countries are dominated by a few l arge athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retai lers with 
many stores. These retailers have in the past incre ased their market share and may continue to do so i n the future by expanding through acquisitions and 
construction of additional stores. These situations  concentrate our credit risk with a relatively smal l number of retailers, and, if any of these retaile rs were to 
experience a shortage of liquidity, it would increa se the risk that their outstanding payables to us m ay not be paid. In addition, increasing market shar e concentration 
among one or a few retailers in a particular countr y or region increases the risk that if any one of t hem substantially reduces their purchases of our pr oducts, we may 
be unable to find a sufficient number of other reta il outlets for our products to sustain the same lev el of sales and revenues.  
Our Direct to Consumer operations have required and  will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment 
of resources, and are subject to numerous risks and  uncertainties.  
Our Direct to Consumer stores have required substan tial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold im provements, information systems, inventory and pers onnel. 
We have entered into substantial operating lease co mmitments for retail space. Certain stores have bee n designed and built to serve as high- profile venues to 
promote brand awareness and marketing activities. B ecause of their unique design elements, locations a nd size, these stores require substantially more in vestment 
than other stores. Due to the high fixed- cost structure associated with our Direct to Consum er operations, a decline in sales or the closure or  poor performance of 
individual or multiple stores could result in signi ficant lease termination costs, write-offs of equip ment and leasehold improvements and employee-relate d costs.  
Many factors unique to retail operations, some of w hich are beyond the Company’ s control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks incl ude, but are not limited to: credit 
card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channe l partners; and inability to manage costs associate d with store construction and operation. In additio n, extreme 
weather conditions in the areas in which our stores  are located could adversely affect our business.  
If the technology- based systems that give our customers the ability t o shop with us online do not function effectively, our 
operating results, as well as our ability to grow o ur e-commerce business globally, could be materiall y adversely affected. 
Many of our customers shop with us through our e- commerce website and mobile commerce applications. Increasingly, customers are using tablets and smart  
phones to shop online with us and with our competit ors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasin gly using social media and proprietary mobile appli cations 
to interact with our customers and as a means to en hance their shopping experience. Any failure on our  part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, u ser-friendly e-
commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that co ntinually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers 
could place us at a competitive disadvantage, resul t in the loss of e- commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact 
on the growth of our e-commerce business globally a nd could have a material adverse impact on our busi ness and results of operations.  
Risks specific to our e-commerce business also incl ude diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating t he in-store 
experience through direct channels and liability fo r online content. Our failure to successfully respo nd to these risks might adversely affect sales in o ur e-commerce 
business, as well as damage our reputation and bran ds.  
Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intell ectual property rights could adversely affect our b usiness.  
We believe that our intellectual property rights ar e important to our brand, our success and our compe titive position. We periodically discover products that are 
counterfeit reproductions of our products or that o therwise infringe on our intellectual property righ ts. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intelle ctual property, 
continued sales of these products could adversely a ffect our sales and our brand and could result in a  shift of consumer preference away from our product s.  
The actions we take to establish and protect our in tellectual property rights may not be adequate to p revent imitation of our products by others or to pr event others 
from seeking to block sales of our products as viol ations of proprietary rights.  
We may be subject to liability if third parties suc cessfully claim that we infringe on their intellect ual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive 
and time- consuming and might result in our entering into cos tly license agreements. We also may be subject to s ignificant damages or injunctions against 
development, use, importation and/or sale of certai n products.  
We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized  use and/or disclosure of confidential information.  Such actions include contractual measures such as entering 
into non-disclosure and non- compete agreements and providing confidential infor mation awareness training. Our controls and efforts  to prevent unauthorized use 
and/or disclosure of confidential information might  not always be effective. Confidential information that is related to business strategy, new technolog ies, mergers 
and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently  used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of repu tation, a 
decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact  on our market position, and could lead to damages,  fines, penalties or injunctions.

In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual proper ty rights to the same extent as the laws of the Uni ted States. We 
may face significant expenses and liability in conn ection with the protection of our intellectual prop erty rights, including outside the United States, a nd if we are 
unable to successfully protect our rights or resolv e intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely af fected.  
We are subject to the risk that our licensees may n ot generate expected sales or maintain the value of  our brands.  
We currently license, and expect to continue licens ing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as tra demarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees 
fail to successfully market and sell licensed produ cts, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effect ively manage their business operations, customer re lationships, labor 
relationships, supplier relationships or credit ris ks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both di rectly from reduced royalties received and indirect ly from reduced 
sales of our other products.  
We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect  our brands through approval rights over the design , 
production processes, quality, packaging, merchandi sing, distribution, advertising and promotion of ou r licensed products, we cannot completely control t he use of 
our licensed brands by our licensees. The misuse of  a brand by a licensee could have a material advers e effect on that brand and on us.  
We are subject to data security and privacy risks t hat could negatively affect our results, operations  or reputation.  
Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophistic ated and operate large- scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss 
of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers’ or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our busines s, which could give rise to unwanted 
media attention, materially damage our customer rel ationships and reputation and result in lost sales,  fines or lawsuits.  
In addition, we must comply with increasingly compl ex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to pro tect business and personal data. Any failure to com ply with 
these regulatory standards could subject us to lega l and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to s ecure personal information could also result in vio lation of data 
privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against t he Company by governmental entities or others, dama ge to our reputation and credibility and could have  a 
negative impact on revenues and profits.  
Failure of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct, loc al laws and other 
standards could harm our business.  
We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the  United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliat ed 
parties to manufacture or contract for the manufact ure of products using our intellectual property. We  require the contractors that directly manufacture our products 
and our licensees that make products using our inte llectual property (including, indirectly, their con tract manufacturers) to comply with a code of condu ct and other 
environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contracto rs to comply with applicable standards for product safety. 
Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from  time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to 
enforce such standards or applicable local law on t heir contractors. Significant or continuing noncomp liance with such standards and laws by one or more 
contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an ad verse effect on our sales and financial condition.  
Our international operations involve inherent risks  which could result in harm to our business.  
Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and t he majority of our products are sold outside of the  United States. 
Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abr oad, which include foreign laws and regulations, va rying 
consumer preferences across geographic regions, pol itical unrest, disruptions or delays in cross- border shipments and changes in economic conditions  in countries 
in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. In addition, disease outbreaks, terr orist acts and military conflict have increased the  risks of 
doing business abroad. These factors, among others,  could affect our ability to manufacture products o r procure materials, our ability to import products , our ability 
to sell products in international markets and our c ost of doing business. If any of these or other fac tors make the conduct of business in a particular c ountry 
undesirable or impractical, our business could be a dversely affected. In addition, many of our importe d products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas  that affect the 
cost and quantity of various types of goods importe d into the United States and other countries. Any c ountry in which our products are produced or sold m ay 
eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tar iffs, safeguard measures, anti- dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terro rism, restrictions on the transfer 
of currency, climate change legislation, product sa fety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our re sults of 
operations and financial condition.  
Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabiliti es could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.  
We earn a substantial portion of our income in fore ign countries, and are subject to the tax laws of t hose jurisdictions. The Company's most significant tax liabilities 
are incurred in the United States, China and the Ne therlands. If our capital or financing needs in the  U.S. require us to repatriate earnings from foreig n jurisdictions 
above our current levels, our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted. Current economic and political conditions  make tax 
rules in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subj ect to significant change. There have been proposal s to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws that could si gnificantly 
impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxe d on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict w hether or in what form these proposals will pass, s everal of 
the proposals considered, if enacted into law, coul d have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows.  
Our effective income tax rate in the future could b e adversely affected by a number of factors, includ ing changes in the mix of earnings in countries wit h differing 
statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of de ferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax l aws, the outcome of income tax audits in various ju risdictions 
around the world and any repatriation of non-U.S. e arnings for which we have not previously provided f or U.S. taxes.

We and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax juris dictions. Although we believe that these transactio ns reflect 
the accurate economic allocation of profit and that  the proper transfer pricing documentation is in pl ace, the profit allocation and transfer pricing ter ms and conditions 
may be scrutinized by local tax authorities during an audit and any resulting changes may impact our m ix of earnings in countries with differing statutor y tax rates.  
Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced  tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holi days and rulings that expire in whole or in part fr om time to time. 
These tax holidays and rulings may be extended when  certain conditions are met, or terminated if certa in conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are 
not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditio ns of the reduced tax rate, then our effective tax rate would increase in the future.  
We are also subject to the examination of our tax r eturns by the Internal Revenue Service and other ta x authorities. We regularly assess all of these mat ters to 
determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion. Although we b elieve our tax provisions are adequate, the final d etermination of 
tax audits and any related disputes could be materi ally different from our historical income tax provi sions and accruals. The results of audits or relate d disputes 
could have an adverse effect on our financial state ments for the period or periods for which the appli cable final determinations are made.  
If one or more of our counterparty financial instit utions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant 
losses.  
As part of our hedging activities, we enter into tr ansactions involving derivative financial instrumen ts, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures 
contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with  various financial institutions. In addition, we ha ve significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents an d other 
investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or  other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk  of default by 
or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of  uncertainty in 
the financial markets. If one of our counterparties  were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, o ur ability to recover losses incurred as a result o f default or our 
assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpart y’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the in solvency or 
bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we co uld incur significant losses, which could negativel y impact our 
results of operations and financial condition.  
We rely on a concentrated source base of contract m anufacturers to supply a significant portion of our  footwear products. 
NIKE is supplied by approximately 146 footwear fact ories located in 14 countries. We do not own or ope rate any of our own footwear manufacturing faciliti es and 
depend upon independent contract manufacturers to m anufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In  fiscal 2015, five footwear contract manufacturers each 
accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2015 footw ear production, and in aggregate accounted for appr oximately 69% of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 
2015. Our ability to meet our customers' needs depe nds on our ability to maintain a steady supply of p roducts from our independent contract manufacturers . If one 
or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter t he terms of our relationship, we may not be able to  obtain 
replacement products in a timely manner, which coul d have a material adverse effect on our sales, fina ncial condition or results of operations. Additiona lly, if any of 
our primary contract manufacturers fail to make tim ely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or  otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance  with our 
plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  
Our products are subject to risks associated with o verseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.  
The principal materials used in our apparel product s — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, speciali zed performance fabrics designed to efficiently wic k 
moisture away from the body, retain heat or repel r ain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardwa re — are available in countries where our manufacturing 
takes place. The principal materials used in our fo otwear products — natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, fo am cushioning materials, natural and 
synthetic leather, nylon, canvas and polyurethane f ilms — are also locally available to manufacturers. Both o ur apparel and footwear products are dependent upon  
the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufactur ers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate pe rsonnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw mat erials and 
are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regul ated by the governments of the countries in which o ur products are manufactured.  
There could be a significant disruption in the supp ly of fabrics or raw materials from current sources  or, in the event of a disruption, our contract man ufacturers might 
not be able to locate alternative suppliers of mate rials of comparable quality at an acceptable price,  or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manu facturers have 
experienced and may continue to experience in the f uture, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in 
compliance costs due to governmental regulation con cerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of  our products. In addition, we cannot be certain th at our 
unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our  orders in a timely manner. If we experience signif icant increases in demand, or reductions in the ava ilability of 
materials, or need to replace an existing manufactu rer, there can be no assurance that additional supp lies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manu facturing 
capacity will be available when required on terms t hat are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any su pplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient ca pacity to us in 
order to meet our requirements. In addition, even i f we are able to expand existing or find new manufa cturing or sources of materials, we may encounter d elays in 
production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in ou r methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health 
and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or i ncreased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have  an adverse 
effect on our ability to meet retail customer and c onsumer demand for our products and result in lower  revenues and net income both in the short- and lon g- term.  
Because independent manufacturers make a majority o f our products outside of our principal sales marke ts, our products must be transported by third parti es over 
large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability  of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, i nfrastructure 
congestion or other factors, and costs and delays a ssociated with consolidating or transitioning betwe en manufacturers, could adversely impact our financ ial 
performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or u nexpected demand for our products may require us to  use faster, but more expensive, transportation met hods 
such as air freight, which could adversely affect o ur profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant  component in manufacturing and transportation cost s, so increases 
in the price of petroleum products can adversely af fect our profit margins.

In addition, Sojitz America performs significant im port-export financing services for the Company. During f iscal 2015, Sojitz America provided financing and 
purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in  certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Uruguay,  Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines,  South 
Africa and Thailand (collectively the "Sojitz Marke ts"), excluding products produced and sold in the s ame country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provi de these 
services or any failure of Sojitz America’ s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire produc ts from our suppliers and to deliver products to ou r customers in the Sojitz 
Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled  orders that would adversely affect sales and profi tability.  
Our success depends on our global distribution faci lities.  
We distribute our products to customers directly fr om the factory and through distribution centers loc ated throughout the world. Our ability to meet cust omer 
expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and g rowth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on  the 
proper operation of our distribution facilities, th e development or expansion of additional distributi on capabilities and the timely performance of servi ces by third 
parties (including those involved in shipping produ ct to and from our distribution facilities). Our di stribution facilities could be interrupted by infor mation technology 
problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires . Any significant failure in our distribution facil ities could result in an adverse effect on our busi ness. We 
maintain business interruption insurance, but it ma y not adequately protect us from adverse effects th at could be caused by significant disruptions in ou r distribution 
facilities.  
We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain an d retail operations, 
and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that  technology could harm our ability to effectively o perate our business.  
We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and th ird-party hosted services (“ information technology 
systems”), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, t ransportation, sales and distribution, as well as f or 
processing financial information for external and i nternal reporting purposes, retail operations and o ther business activities. Our ability to effectivel y manage and 
maintain our inventory and to ship products to cust omers on a timely basis depends significantly on th e reliability of these information technology syste ms. Over a 
number of years, we have implemented information te chnology systems in all of the geographical regions  in which we operate. Our work to integrate and enh ance 
these systems and related processes in our global o perations is ongoing. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of se curity 
breaches, viruses, hackers or other causes, or prob lems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment a nd 
reduced efficiency of our operations, could require  significant capital investments to remediate the p roblem, and may have an adverse effect on our reput ation, 
results of operations and financial condition.  
We also use information technology systems to proce ss financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory 
financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If  our information technology systems suffer severe d amage, disruption or shutdown and our business cont inuity 
plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a ti mely manner, we could experience delays in reportin g our financial results, which could result in lost  revenues and 
profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermor e, we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital market ing, 
digital commerce and the marketing and use of our N IKE+ products and services. We also engage in elect ronic communications throughout the world between a nd 
among our employees as well as with other third par ties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and c onsumers. Our information technology systems are cr itical to 
many of our operating activities and our business p rocesses and may be negatively impacted by any serv ice interruption or shutdown.  
The market for prime real estate is competitive.  
Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to op en new retail stores and otherwise conduct our oper ations, both domestically and internationally, depe nds on the 
availability of real estate that meets our criteria  for traffic, square footage, co- tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to 
effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize , consolidate, reposition or close some of our real  estate 
locations, which may require modification of an exi sting lease. Failure to secure adequate new locatio ns or successfully modify leases for existing locat ions, or 
failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financi al condition.  
Additionally, the economic environment may at times  make it difficult to determine the fair market ren t of real estate properties domestically and intern ationally. This 
could impact the quality of our decisions to exerci se lease options at previously negotiated rents and  to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse 
effect on the quality of these decisions could impa ct our ability to retain real estate locations adeq uate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our 
existing fleet of stores, which could have an adver se effect on our operating results and financial co ndition.  
Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters co uld negatively impact our operating results and fin ancial condition.  
Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which ou r retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution  centers and vendors are located could adversely af fect our 
operating results and financial condition. Moreover , natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes  and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United Stat es or 
abroad, and their related consequences and effects,  including energy shortages and public health issue s, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors 
and other suppliers or result in economic instabili ty that may negatively impact our operating results  and financial condition.  
Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operation s fail to produce 
expected returns.  
From time to time, we may invest in technology, bus iness infrastructure, new businesses, product offer ing and manufacturing innovation and expansion of e xisting 
businesses, such as our retail operations, which re quire substantial cash investments and management a ttention. We believe cost- effective investments are 
essential to business growth and profitability. How ever, significant investments are subject to typica l risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or 
expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effe ct on our 
financial results and divert management attention f rom more profitable business operations.

We are subject to periodic litigation and other reg ulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpect ed expense of time 
and resources.  
From time to time we are called upon to defend ours elves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relat ing to our business. Due to the inherent uncertaint ies of 
litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot ac curately predict the ultimate outcome of any such p roceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an ad verse 
impact on our business, financial condition and res ults of operations. In addition, any significant li tigation in the future, regardless of its merits, c ould divert 
management’s attention from our operations and resu lt in substantial legal fees.  
We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business.  
Our future success will depend in part on the conti nued service of key executive officers and personne l. The loss of the services of any key individual c ould harm our 
business. Our future success also depends on our ab ility to recruit, retain and engage our personnel s ufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to 
execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not  be successful in attracting and retaining such per sonnel.  
The sale of a large number of shares of common stoc k owned or managed by our Chairman and related enti ties could 
depress the market price of our common stock.  
As of June 30, 2015, Philip H. Knight, Co -founder and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and  Swoosh, LLC, an entity formed to manage 128,500,00 0 shares of 
Class A Common Stock formerly owned by Mr. Knight, beneficially owned more than 82% of our Class A Com mon Stock. If on June 30, 2015 all of the 
aforementioned Class A Common Stock were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownersh ip percentage of our Class B Common Stock 
would be approximately 17.7%. The Class A Common St ock shares are available for resale, subject to the  requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the t erms of 
the limited liability company agreement governing S woosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of the sale of a s ubstantial number of these shares could have an adv erse 
effect on the market price of our common stock.  
Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic cond itions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowi ng costs and 
limiting our financing options.  
Our long-term debt is currently rated investment gr ade by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’ s Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowe red, borrowing costs for 
future long-term debt or short- term credit facilities may increase and our financi ng options, including our access to the unsecured c redit market, could be limited. We 
may also be subject to restrictive covenants that w ould reduce our flexibility to, among other things,  incur additional indebtedness, make restricted pay ments, pledge 
assets as security, make investments, loans, advanc es, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamenta l changes and enter into transactions with affiliat es. 
Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of o ur lenders under our credit agreements may be termi nated and 
the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In  addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increa sed volatility or disruption in the credit markets,  could 
adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.  
If our internal controls are ineffective, our opera ting results could be adversely affected.  
Our internal control over financial reporting may n ot prevent or detect misstatements because of its i nherent limitations, including the possibility of h uman error, the 
circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. E ven effective internal controls can provide only re asonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements. If we fail to  maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, in cluding any failure to implement required new or im proved controls, 
or if we experience difficulties in their implement ation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial repo rting 
obligations.  
If our estimates or judgments relating to our criti cal accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could 
be adversely affected.  
The preparation of financial statements in conformi ty with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estim ates and assumptions that affect the amounts report ed in 
the consolidated financial statements and accompany ing notes. We base our estimates on historical expe rience and on various other assumptions that we bel ieve to 
be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financi al Condition and Results of Operations.” The results of 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments  about the carrying values of assets, liabilities a nd equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses t hat are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Significant as sumptions and estimates used in preparing our conso lidated financial statements include those related to revenue 
recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts r eceivable, inventories, contingent payments under e ndorsement contracts, accounting for property, plan t and 
equipment and definite-lived assets and goodwill an d indefinite- lived intangible assets. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change 
or if actual circumstances differ from those in our  assumptions, which could cause our operating resul ts to fall below the expectations of securities ana lysts and 
investors, resulting in a decline in the price of o ur Class B Common Stock.  
Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common st ock.  
There are provisions of our articles of incorporati on and Oregon law that are intended to protect shar eholder interests by providing the Board of Directo rs a means to 
attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to ne gotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtai n more favorable terms. Such provisions include a c ontrol share 
acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two clas ses of stock that vote separately on certain issues , and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock  elect three-
quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions cou ld discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merg er, 
acquisition or other change in control of our compa ny that some shareholders might believe to be in th eir best interests or in which shareholders might r eceive a 
premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourag e proxy contests for control of the Company.

We may fail to meet market expectations, which coul d cause the price of our stock to decline.  
Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at  any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. Thes e reports 
include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts’ estimates of our futur e performance. Analysts’ estimates are based upon their own 
opinions and are often different from our estimates  or expectations. If our operating results are belo w the estimates or expectations of public market an alysts and 
investors, our stock price could decline. In the pa st, securities class action litigation has been bro ught against NIKE and other companies following a d ecline in the 
market price of their securities. If our stock pric e is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could r esult in substantial 
costs and a diversion of management’s attention and  resources that are needed to successfully run our business.

ITEM 2. Properties  
The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE.  
The NIKE World Campus, owned by NIKE and located ne ar Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is a 394- acre facility of 44 buildings which, together with adjacent leased 
properties, functions as our world headquarters and is occupied  by approximately 9,200 employees engaged in manage ment, research, design, development, 
marketing, finance and other administrative functio ns serving nearly all of our divisions. We also lea se various office facilities in the surrounding met ropolitan area. 
We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative fac ility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which serves a s the headquarters for the Western Europe and Centr al & 
Eastern Europe geographies, and manages certain bra nd management functions for our non- U.S. operations. We also lease an office complex in  Shanghai, China, 
our headquarters for Greater China, occupied by emp loyees focused on implementing our wholesale, DTC a nd merchandising strategies in the region, among ot her 
functions. In the United States, NIKE owns a full p roduct line distribution center located in Memphis,  Tennessee. In addition, NIKE has four other distri bution centers, 
three of which are leased, also located in Memphis.  NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution ce nter, 
which we lease. Smaller leased distribution facilit ies for non -NIKE Brand businesses are located in various parts of the United States. We also own or lease 
distribution and customer service facilities outsid e the United States. The most significant are the d istribution facilities located in Laakdal, Belgium;  Taicang, China; 
Tomisato, Japan and Incheon, Korea, all of which we  own.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Fin ancial 
Condition and Results of Operations  
NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and servi ces worldwide. We are the largest seller of athleti c footwear 
and apparel in the world. We sell our products to r etail accounts, through NIKE-owned in-line and fact ory retail stores and NIKE- owned internet websites (which we 
refer to as our “Direct to Consumer” or "DTC" operations), and through a mix of independ ent distributors, licensees and sales representativ es in virtually all countries 
around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to o ur shareholders by building a profitable global por tfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories 
businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term re venue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connectio ns with 
our brands and delivering compelling consumer exper iences at retail and online.  
In addition to achieving long- term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to st rive to deliver shareholder value by driving operat ional excellence in several key 
areas:  
- Delivering innovative, premium products that comman d higher prices while maintaining a balanced price- to-value proposition for consumers;  
- Reducing product costs through a continued focus on  manufacturing efficiency, product design and innov ation;  
- Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automat ion, help reduce waste and have long- term 
potential to increase both customization of our pro ducts and speed to market; and  
- Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC busin ess as part of an integrated marketplace growth str ategy across our DTC and wholesale operations. 
- Investments in consumer engagement that drive econo mic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit;  
- Infrastructure investments that improve the efficie ncy and effectiveness of our operations; and  
- Increasing the productivity of our legacy infrastru cture.  
Through execution of this strategy, our long-term f inancial goals continue to be:  
Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of t hese financial goals. During this time, revenues an d diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc.,  
inclusive of both continuing and discontinued opera tions, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an a nnual compounded basis. Our return on invested capi tal 
has increased from 23.2% to 28.1% and we expanded g ross margins by approximately 150 basis points.  
On November 15, 2012, we announced a two-for- one stock split of both Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was in the form of a 100% s tock 
dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholde rs of record at the close of business on December 1 0, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-
adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numb ers and per share amounts presented reflect the sto ck split.  
Our fiscal 2015 results from continuing operations demonstrated NIKE's ongoing commitment to deliver c onsistent growth in revenues, earnings and cash ret urns to 
shareholders, while investing for long- term growth. Despite significant foreign currency h eadwinds, we delivered record revenues and earnings  per share in fiscal 
2015. NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 10% to $30.6 billion, gross margin expanded 12 0 basis points, Net income from continuing operations increased 22% to $3.3 
billion and diluted earnings per common share incre ased 25% to $3.70.  
Earnings before interest and income taxes ("EBIT") from continuing operations increased 18% for fiscal  2015, driven by revenue growth and gross margin 
expansion, which more than offset higher selling an d administrative expense. The increase in revenues was attributable to growth across nearly all NIKE B rand 
geographies, key categories and product types. This  broad-based growth was primarily fueled by:  
Our Converse business also grew, with revenue and E BIT growth of 18% and 4%, respectively.  
Gross margin increased primarily due to higher aver age selling prices and the favorable impact of our higher-margin DTC businesses, partially offset by higher 
product input costs, primarily a result of labor in put cost inflation and shifts in mix to higher-cost  products.  
For fiscal 2015, the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a year-over- year decrease in our effective tax rate of 180 basi s 
points primarily due to the favorable resolution of  audits in several jurisdictions. In addition, dilu ted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate  than net 
income due to a 2% decrease in the weighted average  diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our s hare repurchase program.  
 
20  •  Expanding gross margin by: 
•  Optimizing selling and administrative expense by fo cusing on: 
•  Improving working capital efficiency; and 
•  Deploying capital effectively. 
•  High single- digit revenue growth, 
•  Mid-teens earnings per share growth, 
•  Strong return on invested capital and accelerated c ash flows and 
•  Sustainable, profitable, long- term growth through effective management of our div ersified portfolio of businesses. 
•  Innovative performance and sportswear products, inc orporating proprietary technology platforms such as  NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri- Fit and 
Flyknit;  
•  Deep brand connections to consumers through a categ ory lens, reinforced by investments in endorsements  by high-profile athletes, sports teams and 
leagues, high-impact marketing around global sporti ng events (such as the World Cup and NFL Super Bowl ) and digital marketing; and  
•  Strong category retail presentation online and at N IKE-owned and retail partner stores.

Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
On a currency- neutral basis, revenues from NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 14% for fiscal 2015, driven by incr eases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and 
Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography delivered high er revenues for fiscal 2015 as our category offense  continued to deliver innovative products, deep bra nd 
connections and compelling retail experiences to co nsumers. North America contributed 5 percentage poi nts of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while W estern 
Europe contributed 4 percentage points, Greater Chi na contributed 2 percentage points and Central & Ea stern Europe, Emerging Markets and Converse each 
contributed 1 percentage point.  
Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchan ge rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 17% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Bra nd 
equipment revenues increased 1% during fiscal 2015.  The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for f iscal 2015 was driven by strong performance in our 
Sportswear, Basketball, Running and Football (Socce r) categories. Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2015 i ncreased 9% and increases in average selling price per pair 
contributed approximately 8 percentage points of fo otwear revenue growth. The increase in average sell ing price per pair was driven primarily by shifts i n mix to 
higher-priced products, and to a lesser extent, the  favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DT C business.  
The constant- currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues fo r fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in most key cate gories, led by Sportswear, Running and 
Women's Training, which were partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer) due largely to the com parison to significant sales of replica apparel in advance of the 
World Cup in 2014. Fiscal 2015 unit sales of appare l increased 8% and increases in average selling pri ce per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of 
apparel revenue growth. The increase in average sel ling price per unit was driven primarily by increas ed revenues from our higher-priced DTC business.  
While wholesale revenues remain the largest compone nt of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to e xpand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies . 
Our NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in -line and factory stores, as well as online sales t hrough NIKE- owned websites. For fiscal 2015, DTC 
revenues represented approximately 23% of our total  NIKE Brand revenues compared to 20% in fiscal 2014 . On a currency- neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 29% 
for fiscal 2015, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 16%, significant online sales growt h and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales 
include revenues from NIKE-owned in- line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store  has been open at least 
one year, (2) square footage has not changed by mor e than 15% within the past year and (3) the store h as not been permanently repositioned within the pas t year. 
Online sales through NIKE- owned websites, which are not included in comparabl e store sales, grew 59% in fiscal 2015. Online sale s represented approximately 
18% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal  2015 compared to 15% for fiscal 2014.  
On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the e ffects of changes in currency exchange rates, fisca l 2015 NIKE Brand Men’ s revenues increased 9%, driven by 
growth in our Sportswear, Basketball and Running ca tegories. Women’ s revenues accelerated in fiscal 2015, achieving 20 % growth primarily due to increases in 
Sportswear, Running and Women's Training categories . Revenues in our Young Athletes' business increase d 19% as a result of continued efforts to expand 
footwear and apparel offerings for this group acros s multiple categories, particularly Basketball.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
On a currency- neutral basis, revenues from NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 11% for fiscal 2014, driven by incr eases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and 
Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography delivered high er revenues for fiscal 2014. North America contribu ted 5 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, In c. 
revenues, while Western Europe and Emerging Markets  each contributed 2 percentage points and Central &  Eastern Europe and Converse each contributed 1 
percentage point.  
On a currency- neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel reve nues increased 12% and 10%, respectively, while NIK E Brand equipment revenues increased 
4% during fiscal 2014. The increase in NIKE Brand f ootwear revenues for fiscal 2014 was mainly due to growth in our Basketball, Sportswear, Running and F ootball 
(Soccer) categories. Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased approximately 7% and the average sel ling price per pair contributed approximately 5 per centage 
points of footwear revenue growth, driven nearly eq ually by price increases and shifts in mix to highe r-priced products.  
For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenues fo r fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in all key categ ories, most notably our Football (Soccer), Running and 
Women's Training categories. In fiscal 2014, unit s ales of apparel increased approximately 6% and the average selling price per unit contributed approxim ately 4 
percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven  by price increases and, to a lesser extent, a shif t in mix to higher-priced products.  
For fiscal 2014, DTC revenues represented approxima tely 20% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 18% in fiscal 2013. On a currency- neutral basis, DTC 
revenues grew 22% for fiscal 2014, as comparable st ore sales grew 10%, and we continued to open new st ores and expand our e- commerce business. Online 
sales through NIKE- owned websites grew 42% in fiscal 2014. Online sale s represented approximately 15% of our total NIKE B rand DTC revenues for fiscal 2014 
compared to 12% for fiscal 2013.

(4)  Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign cur rency revenue- related hedge gains and losses generated by entitie s within the NIKE Brand geographic 
operating segments and Converse through our central ly managed foreign exchange risk management program .  
(5)  References to NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent reven ues are intended to provide context as to the total  size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no

wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer oper ations which are charged at prices that are compara ble to prices charged to external wholesale 
customers.

On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the e ffects of changes in currency exchange rates, fisca l 2014 NIKE Brand Men's revenues increased 9% mainl y as 
a result of strong growth in our Basketball, Footba ll (Soccer), Running and Sportswear categories. Wom en's revenues increased 12% in large part due to in creases 
in our Running, Sportswear and Women's Training cat egories. The 16% increase in the Young Athletes' bu siness was driven by increases in the Basketball an d 
Football (Soccer) categories in part due to our exp anded footwear and apparel offerings for this age g roup.  
Futures Orders  
Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2 015 were 2% higher than the orders reported for the  
comparable prior year period. The U.S. Dollar futur es order amount is calculated based upon our intern al forecast of the currency exchange rates under wh ich our 
revenues will be translated during this period. Exc luding the impact of currency changes, futures orde rs increased 13%, with unit orders and average sell ing price 
per unit contributing approximately 8 and 5 percent age points of growth, respectively.  
By geography, futures orders growth was as follows:     
The reported futures orders growth is not necessari ly indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over- year changes in 
shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders betwe en futures and at- once orders and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule 
noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuation s as well as differing levels of order cancellation s, discounts and returns can cause differences in t he 
comparisons between futures orders and actual reven ues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not deri ved from futures orders, including sales of at- once and 
closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our DTC operations  and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley.

Total Selling and Administrative Expense  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
Demand creation expense increased 6% for fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to support for key brand and co nsumer events, including the World 
Cup in early fiscal 2015, increased digital brand m arketing, investments in DTC marketing and higher s ports marketing expense. Changes in foreign currenc y 
exchange rates decreased growth in Demand creation expense by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 201 5.  
Operating overhead expense increased 16% compared to the prior year, primarily  driven by investments in our rapidly growing DTC b usiness, including new store 
openings and higher variable expenses, investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-focused digital capabilities and higher performance- based 
compensation. For fiscal 2015, changes in foreign c urrency exchange rates decreased growth in Operating overhead expense by approximately 3 percentage 
points.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
Demand creation expense increased 10% compared to the prior year, mainly dr iven by marketing support for events, including the  World Cup, higher sports 
marketing expense, key product launches and initiat ives and investments to upgrade the presentation of  our products in wholesale accounts. For fiscal 201 4, 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Demand creation expense .  
Compared to the prior year, Operating overhead expense increased 14%, primarily attributable to growth in our DTC business driven by new store openings, high er 
personnel costs and e- commerce launches, as well as increased investments  in our digital capabilities and corporate infrastr ucture. Changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates did not have a material impact on Operating overhead expense for fiscal 2014.  
Other (Income) Expense, Net  
Other (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and los ses from the re- measurement of monetary assets and liabilities deno minated in 
non-functional currencies and the impact of certain  foreign currency derivative instruments, as well a s unusual or non- operating transactions that are outside the 
normal course of business.  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
Other (income) expense, net shifted from $103 million of other expense, net for  fiscal 2014 to $58 million of other (income), net for fiscal 2015, primarily driven by a 
$147 million change to net foreign currency convers ion gains, primarily due to significant hedge gains  from available-for- sale investments, as well as an adverse 
legal judgment in the prior year related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer i n Western Europe.  
We estimate the combination of the translation of f oreign currency-denominated profits from our intern ational business and the year-over- year change in foreign 
currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $73 million for fiscal 
2015.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
Other (income) expense, net shifted from $15 million of other (income), net for fiscal 2013 to $103 mill ion of other expense, net for fiscal 2014, primaril y driven by a 
$90 million adverse change in foreign currency conv ersion gains and losses as well as an adverse legal  judgment in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 rela ted to a 
long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former custo mer in Western Europe.  
We estimate the combination of the translation of f oreign currency-denominated profits from our intern ational businesses and the year-over- year change in foreign 
currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $139 million for fiscal 
2014.  
Income Taxes

Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
The 70 basis point decrease in our effective tax ra te for the fiscal year was primarily driven by an i ncrease in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Dur ing the fourth 
quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, we r eached a resolution with the IRS on an Advanced Pri cing Agreement. This agreement did not have a mater ial 
impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014. R efer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Finan cial Statements for additional 
disclosure.  
Our reportable operating segments are evidence of t he structure of the Company's internal organization . The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic  
regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.  
Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predomi nantly in one industry: the design, development, ma rketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel a nd 
equipment. The Company’ s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Easte rn Europe, Greater China, 
Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for  the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company’ s NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each  
geographic operating segment. Converse is also a re portable segment for NIKE, Inc., and operates in on e industry: the design, marketing, licensing and se lling of 
casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.  
As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange r isk management program, standard foreign currency r ates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand  
entity in our geographic operating segments and Con verse. These rates are set approximately nine month s in advance of the future selling season based on 
average market spot rates in the calendar month pre ceding the date they are established. Inventories a nd cost of sales for geographic operating segments and 
Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to  record non-functional currency product purchases i nto the entity’ s functional currency. Differences between 
assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual  market rates are included in Corporate together wi th foreign currency hedge gains and losses generate d from 
our centrally managed foreign exchange risk managem ent program and other conversion gains and losses.  
The breakdown of revenues is as follows:  
The primary financial measure used by the Company t o evaluate performance of individual operating segm ents is earnings before interest and taxes (commonl y 
referred to as “EBIT”), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As 
discussed in Note 18 — Operating Segments and Relat ed Information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Finan cial Statements, certain corporate costs 
are not included in EBIT of our operating segments.

The breakdown of earnings before interest and taxes  is as follows:  
North America  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
North America revenues increased 12%, despite conge stion at ports on the West Coast of the United Stat es in the second half of the fiscal year, which aff ected the 
Company's supply chain and flow of product to custo mers. Revenue growth was driven by nearly all key c ategories for fiscal 2015, led by our Basketball, S portswear 
and Men's and Women's Training categories. On a con stant currency basis, DTC revenue grew 17% for fisc al 2015, fueled by comparable store sales growth of  8%, 
strong online sales growth and the addition of new stores.  
Footwear revenue growth was driven by increases in most key categories, notably Basketball and Sportsw ear. Unit sales of footwear for fiscal 2015 increas ed 6% 
and higher average selling price per pair contribut ed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear re venue growth. The increase in average selling price  per pair 
was primarily due to shifts in mix to higher -priced products, and to a lesser extent, price inc reases.  
Apparel revenue growth was attributable to strong d emand in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Me n's Training, Women's Training and Running, partial ly 
offset by slight declines in Football (Soccer) and Action Sports. For fiscal 2015, unit sales of appar el increased 9% and higher average selling price pe r unit 
contributed approximately 3 percentage points of ap parel revenue growth. The increase in average selli ng price per unit was driven primarily by the favor able impact 
of our higher-priced DTC business, as well as shift s in mix to higher-priced products.  
EBIT grew 18% for fiscal 2015 as a result of higher  revenues, gross margin expansion and selling and a dministrative expense leverage. Gross margin increa sed 
110 basis points due to shifts in mix to higher-pri ced products, improved off- price product margins and lower inventory obsolesce nce costs, partially offset by higher 
product input and logistics costs. Selling and admi nistrative expense decreased as a percent of revenu es despite higher demand creation expense to suppor t key 
brand and sporting events and higher sports marketi ng expense. Operating overhead costs also increased  to support DTC growth and investments in infrastru cture, 
as well as higher performance-based compensation co sts.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
Our continued focus on the category offense drove i ncreased demand for NIKE Brand products across all key categories for fiscal 2014. Our Basketball, Men 's 
Training, Running and Sportswear categories fueled the revenue growth in fiscal 2014. DTC revenue grow th in North America for fiscal 2014 was driven by a  7% (Dollars in millions)    Fiscal 2015    Fiscal 2014 (1)    % Change    Fiscal 2013 (1)    % Change

Footwear revenue growth in North America was driven  by higher demand in nearly all key categories, led  by our Basketball, Running and Sportswear categori es. 
For fiscal 2014, unit sales increased 7% and averag e selling price per pair contributed 4 percentage p oints of footwear revenue growth. The increase in a verage 
selling price per pair was driven by price increase s and shifts in mix toward higher-priced products i n nearly equal amounts.  
North America apparel revenue growth was fueled by higher demand in all key categories, most notably o ur Men's Training, Women's Training and Sportswear 
categories. Unit sales increased 6% and average sel ling price per unit contributed approximately 4 per centage points of apparel revenue growth. The incre ase in 
average selling price per unit was primarily driven  by price increases, and to a lesser extent, shifts  in mix to higher-priced products.  
EBIT grew faster than revenues due to gross margin expansion and slight selling and administrative exp ense leverage. Gross margin increased 120 basis poi nts for 
fiscal 2014, reflecting pricing initiatives as well  as lower product costs as a result of favorable ch anges in product mix. These gross margin benefits w ere partially 
offset by higher off- price mix. Selling and administrative expenses grew  in line with revenues as a result of higher operat ing overhead costs to support DTC growth 
and higher demand creation expense in support of th e World Cup and key product and brand initiatives.  
Western Europe  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, r evenues for fiscal 2015 increased 21% and grew in e very territory, led by AGS (Austria, Germany and 
Switzerland) and the UK & Ireland, our largest terr itories in Western Europe, which grew 27% and 20%, respectively. Revenues grew for every key category,  most 
notably Sportswear and Running. DTC revenues grew 4 0%, driven by comparable store sales growth of 24%,  strong online sales growth and the addition of new  
stores.  
The constant currency footwear revenue growth was d riven by increases in nearly every category, most n otably Sportswear, Running and Football (Soccer). F or 
fiscal 2015, unit sales of footwear increased 20% a nd average selling price per pair contributed appro ximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue gr owth. The 
increase in average selling price per pair was driv en equally by shifts in mix to higher-priced produc ts and the favorable impact of growth in our higher -priced DTC 
business.  
The constant currency apparel revenue growth was at tributable to increases in nearly all key categorie s, led by Sportswear, Women's Training and Running,  
partially offset by a slight decline in Football (S occer) primarily due to the impact of World Cup in fiscal 2014. Unit sales of apparel in fiscal 2015 i ncreased 14% 
while average selling price per unit was flat compa red to the prior year.  
Despite the negative translation impact from change s in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the Euro, reported EBIT grew 49% for fiscal 2015 as  a result 
of strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion an d selling and administrative expense leverage. Gros s margin increased 190 basis points, primarily due to 
favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher average selling prices, which were only partially offset by higher product costs. Selling a nd 
administrative expense decreased as a percent of re venues despite increases in operating overhead, pri marily as a result of higher costs to support our g rowing 
DTC business. Demand creation increased largely as a result of higher sports marketing and digital dem and creation costs.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
On a currency- neutral basis, all territories in Western Europe re ported revenue growth for fiscal 2014, except Italy  and Iberia, which declined 7% and 1%, 
respectively. Revenues for the U.K. & Ireland and A GS increased 20% and 23%, respectively. On a catego ry basis, revenue growth in fiscal 2014 was fueled by our 
Running, Football (Soccer) and Sportswear categorie s. The growth in DTC revenues for fiscal 2014 was d riven by 17% growth in comparable store sales, rapi d 
growth in online sales and the addition of 19 net n ew stores.  
Constant currency footwear revenue growth in Wester n Europe reflected increases in every key category,  most notably our Sportswear, Running, Football (So ccer) 
and Basketball categories. Unit sales in fiscal 201 4 increased 11% and average selling price per pair contributed approximately 9 percentage points of fo otwear 
revenue growth. The increase in average price per p air was primarily the result of price increases, sh ifts in mix to higher-priced products and lower dis counts.  
The constant currency increase in Western Europe ap parel revenue was due to increases in Football (Soc cer), Running and Women's Training, partially offse t by a 
decline in Sportswear. Unit sales increased 3% whil e average selling price per unit contributed approx imately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue grow th, driven 
primarily by lower discounts on off-price closeout sales compared to the prior year.

On a reported basis, EBIT for fiscal 2014 grew at a  faster rate than revenues as a result of a 150 bas is point increase in gross margin and selling and a dministrative 
expense leverage. The gross margin increase was fue led by higher average selling prices, growth in our  higher-margin DTC business, lower discounts and lower 
off-price mix, which more than offset unfavorable stand ard foreign currency exchange rates and higher prod uct input costs. Selling and administrative expense  was 
lower as a percent of revenue despite higher operat ing overhead costs to support growth in our DTC bus iness and higher demand creation spending for sport s 
marketing and support for key events, such as the W orld Cup.  
Central & Eastern Europe  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Centr al & Eastern Europe revenues for fiscal 2015 grew 1 5%, attributable to increases in most territories. Turkey, 
one of our largest territories, grew 23% and our di stributors business grew 18%, while revenues declin ed in Israel, our smallest territory. On a category  basis, 
revenue growth was driven by increases in most key categories, primarily Sportswear and Running. DTC r evenues increased 48%, driven by strong comparable 
store sales growth of 28%, the addition of new stor es and online sales growth.  
The constant currency growth in footwear revenue in  fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in nearly all key  categories, most notably Sportswear and Running. U nit sales 
of footwear increased 11% and increases in average selling price per pair contributed approximately 11  percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase 
in average selling price per pair was driven by pri ce increases in response to inflationary conditions  in certain territories, as well as shifts in mix t o higher-priced 
products.  
The constant currency growth in apparel revenue in fiscal 2015 resulted from growth in most key catego ries, led by Sportswear and Running, partially offs et by a 
decline in Football (Soccer) due to comparison to s trong sales related to the World Cup in fiscal 2014 . Unit sales of apparel increased 1% and increases in average 
selling price per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The in crease in average selling price per unit was primar ily due to 
price increases in response to inflationary conditi ons in certain territories.  
On a reported basis, EBIT declined 11% for fiscal 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of weakening foreign currency exchange r ates. Reported revenue increases 
and slight selling and administrative expense lever age were more than offset by lower gross margin. Gr oss margin decreased 340 basis points as higher pro duct 
costs and unfavorable standard foreign currency exc hange rates were only partially offset by higher av erage selling prices. Selling and administrative ex pense 
decreased as a percent of revenue despite increases  in both demand creation and operating overhead. Op erating overhead increased primarily as a result of  
investments in our growing DTC business, while dema nd creation increased as a result of higher sports marketing costs.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
On a currency- neutral basis, Central & Eastern Europe revenues fo r fiscal 2014 were driven by growth across nearly a ll territories, particularly Russia, our largest 
territory, which grew 14%, and Turkey, which grew 1 7%. Revenue growth was driven by growth in nearly e very key category, led by Football (Soccer) and Run ning.  
Constant currency footwear revenue growth in fiscal  2014 was driven by growth in nearly all categories , most notably Running and Football (Soccer). Unit sales 
increased 11% while average selling price per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of fo otwear revenue growth, due primarily to price incre ases.  
Constant currency apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in every key category, le d by Football (Soccer) and Running. Unit sales incr eased 
15%, while average selling price per unit contribut ed approximately 2 percentage points of apparel rev enue growth, driven by price increases.  
On a reported basis, EBIT grew faster than revenues  primarily due to gross margin improvement, partial ly offset by higher selling and administrative expe nse. Gross 
margin increased 180 basis points, primarily driven  by price increases, a shift in mix to higher- margin products, warehousing efficiencies and the f avorable impact of 
our higher- margin DTC business, partially offset by unfavorabl e standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling  and administrative expense increased as a result 
of higher demand creation expense to support key ev ents as well as higher operating overhead to suppor t overall growth, including our expanding DTC busin ess.

Greater China  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Great er China revenue growth for fiscal 2015 was driven by higher revenues in our Sportswear, Running and 
Basketball categories, partially offset by small de clines in other categories. Strong growth in DTC re venues reflected a 28% increase in comparable store  sales, 
strong online sales growth and the addition of new stores.  
Constant currency footwear revenue growth in fiscal  2015 was driven by increased sales in our Sportswe ar, Running and Basketball categories, partially of fset by 
small declines in other categories. Unit sales of f ootwear increased 20% for fiscal 2015 while increas es in average selling price per pair contributed ap proximately 8 
percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The i ncrease in average selling price per pair was due p rimarily to an increase in the proportion of revenu es from our 
higher-priced DTC business.  
Constant currency apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2015 was driven by increases in the Sportswear, Run ning and Basketball categories, partially offset by  
decreases in other categories, primarily Football ( Soccer) and Men’ s Training. For fiscal 2015, unit sales of apparel increased 8% while changes in average selling 
price per unit reduced apparel revenues by approxim ately 1 percentage point. The decline in average se lling price per unit was due primarily to shifts in  mix to lower-
priced products, partially offset by increased reve nues from our higher-priced DTC business.  
On a reported basis, EBIT increased 22% for fiscal 2015 as higher revenues and gross margin expansion more than offset higher selling and administrative 
expense. Gross margin increased 270 basis points pr imarily due to higher average selling prices and an  increase in the proportion of revenues from our hi gher-
margin DTC business, partially offset by higher pro duct costs. Selling and administrative expense incr eased due to higher operating overhead to support g rowth 
initiatives, primarily related to our DTC operation s, as well as higher demand creation spending, prim arily for sports marketing.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Great er China revenues increased 3% in fiscal 2014, prim arily driven by strong growth in our DTC business, which 
represented 22% of total Greater China revenues for  fiscal 2014. The growth in DTC revenues reflected a 20% increase in comparable store sales, the addit ion of 
30 net new stores, as well as online sales growth. The increase in DTC revenues more than offset a 4% decrease in sales in our wholesale business as we 
continued to manage the amount of product sold into  the market and worked with our wholesale partners to optimize product mix for the consumer. On a cate gory 
basis, higher revenues in our Basketball, Sportswea r and Running categories more than offset declines in Men's Training, Action Sports and Women's Traini ng.  
Constant currency footwear revenue growth in fiscal  2014 was driven by increased sales in our Basketba ll and Sportswear categories, partially offset by d eclines in 
our Men's Training, Running and Action Sports categ ories. Unit sales for fiscal 2014 were flat compare d to the prior year while average selling price per  pair 
contributed approximately 5 percentage points of fo otwear revenue growth. The increase in average sell ing price per pair was driven by favorable revenue mix 
resulting from a higher percent of sales from our h igher-priced DTC business, as well as shifts in mix  to higher-priced products.  
Constant currency apparel revenue growth for fiscal  2014 was driven by increases in the Running, Sport swear and Basketball categories, partially offset b y 
decreases in Men's Training and Women's Training. A pparel unit sales in fiscal 2014 were 1% higher whi le average selling price per unit was flat.  
Fiscal 2014 reported EBIT was flat compared to the prior year as reported revenue and gross margin inc reases were offset by higher selling and administra tive 
expense as a percent of sales. Gross margin increas ed 150 basis points as higher average selling price s, growth in our higher- margin DTC business and improved 
margins on closeout sales more than offset higher p roduct input costs and unfavorable product mix. Sel ling and administrative expense increased due to hi gher 
operating overhead costs driven by increased invest ments to support DTC growth and our new Greater Chi na headquarters in Shanghai, as well as higher dema nd 
creation spending.

Japan  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
Constant currency revenues for Japan increased 9% i n fiscal 2015, driven primarily by increases in Spo rtswear, Basketball and Running , partially offset by declines 
in Men's Training, Golf and Women's Training. DTC r evenues grew 40% in fiscal 2015 driven by a 20% inc rease in comparable store sales, strong online sale s 
growth and the addition of new stores.  
On a reported basis, fiscal 2015 EBIT decreased 24%  compared to the prior year period, reflecting the impact of the weaker Yen. Gross margin decreased 27 0 
basis points as unfavorable standard foreign curren cy exchange rates and higher product costs more tha n offset higher average selling prices and an incre ase in the 
proportion of revenues from our higher- margin DTC business. Selling and administrative exp ense increased as a percent of revenues as higher o perating overhead, 
primarily to support our expanding DTC business, wa s only partially offset by a decrease in demand cre ation expense.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
On a currency- neutral basis, revenues increased 5% for Japan, dri ven by higher revenues in Sportswear, Football (Soc cer) and Basketball, partially offset by lower 
revenues in Men's Training and Golf.  
Fiscal 2014 EBIT decreased 6% as a 12% decline in r eported revenues, due to the weaker Yen, was only p artially offset by higher gross margin and selling and 
administrative expense leverage. Gross margin incre ased 20 basis points as higher average selling pric es, favorable off- price mix and the favorable impact of 
higher-margin DTC revenues were mostly offset by unfavorab le standard foreign currency exchange rates. The de crease in selling and administrative expense in 
fiscal 2014 was attributable to lower operating ove rhead and demand creation spending.  
 Emerging Markets  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
On a currency- neutral basis, fiscal 2015 revenues for Emerging Ma rkets increased 8%, driven by growth in 7 of 9 terr itories. Growth was led by one of our largest 
territories, SOCO (which includes Argentina, Urugua y and Chile), which grew 28%, and our Pacific terri tory (which includes Australia and New Zealand), wh ich grew 
26%. Revenues in our Mexico and Brazil territories decreased 21% and 3%, respectively. The decrease in  Mexico was attributable to efforts to liquidate ex cess 
inventory in the marketplace largely resulting from  an inconsistent flow of product to customers follo wing distribution center transition issues in fisca l 2014, while the 
decrease in Brazil was primarily due to challenging  macroeconomic conditions and comparison to strong sales related to the World Cup in fiscal 2014. On a  
category basis, revenues were higher in most key ca tegories, led by Sportswear, Running and Basketball , partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer ). DTC 
revenues increased 51% compared to fiscal 2014, dri ven by strong comparable store sales growth of 26%,  the addition of new stores and online sales growth .  (Dollars in millions)    Fiscal 2015    Fiscal 2014    % Change    % Change

The constant currency growth in footwear revenue fo r fiscal 2015 was attributable to increases in seve ral key categories, most notably Sportswear, Basket ball, 
Action Sports and Running. Unit sales of footwear d ecreased 2% while average selling price per pair co ntributed approximately 11 percentage points of foo twear 
revenue growth. The increase in average selling pri ce per pair was primarily due to price increases in  response to inflationary conditions in certain Lat in American 
countries, particularly Argentina, as well as shift s in mix to higher-priced products and the favorabl e impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC busines s.  
Constant currency apparel revenue growth was due to  increases in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, partially  offset 
by a decline in Football (Soccer) revenues due to h igher World Cup sales in fiscal 2014. Unit sales of  apparel decreased 1% while average selling price p er unit 
contributed approximately 6 percentage points of ap parel revenue growth. The increase in average selli ng price per unit was primarily attributable to an increase in 
revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, and t o a lesser extent, price increases in response to i nflationary conditions.  
On a reported basis, EBIT decreased 14% primarily d ue to reported revenue declines, lower gross margin  and higher selling and administrative expense, as well as 
the impact of weakening foreign currency exchange r ates . Gross margin decreased 140 basis points due to un favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates,  
higher inventory obsolescence and higher off- price mix, partially offset by higher average selli ng prices. Selling and administrative expense incre ased due to higher 
operating overhead costs, primarily to support DTC growth, as well as higher demand creation expense, in part as a result of support for the World Cup in  early 
fiscal 2015 and higher sports marketing expense.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, fisca l 2014 revenues for Emerging Markets increased 13% as a result of growth across nearly every territory . Our 
largest territory, Brazil, grew 19%, while our SOCO  territory grew 25%. Mexico revenues decreased 3% l argely as a result of shipping delays caused by iss ues with 
a distribution center transition in the first half of fiscal 2014. On a category basis, revenues were higher in nearly every category, led by Football (S occer), Running 
and Sportswear.  
Constant currency footwear revenue growth for fisca l 2014 was driven by growth in nearly every key cat egory, led by Running, Sportswear, Football (Soccer ) and 
Action Sports. Unit sales for fiscal 2014 increased  4% and average selling price per pair contributed approximately 6 percentage points of footwear reven ue growth. 
The increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases, in part reflec ting inflationary conditions in certain Latin Ameri can territories, 
and to a lesser extent, shifts in mix to higher-pri ced products.  
Constant currency apparel revenue increased driven by growth in every key category, most notably Footb all (Soccer) and Running. Unit sales increased 11% and 
average selling price per unit contributed approxim ately 10 percentage points of apparel revenue growt h, primarily due to price increases, in part reflec ting 
inflationary conditions in certain Latin American t erritories.  
Fiscal 2014 reported EBIT decreased primarily due t o a decline in gross margin, higher selling and adm inistrative expense and weaker currencies in a numb er of 
developing markets. Gross margin decreased 30 basis  points due primarily to unfavorable foreign curren cy exchange rates, higher product costs, higher 
warehousing costs related to distribution center tr ansition challenges in Mexico and higher discounts,  which more than offset higher average selling pric es. Selling 
and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion o f our DTC business and infrastructure investments t o 
support growth, as well as increases in demand crea tion spending to support the World Cup and key prod uct launches.  
Global Brand Divisions  
Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand c reation, operating overhead and product creation an d design expenses that are centrally managed for th e NIKE 
Brand. Revenues for Global Brand Divisions are prim arily attributable to NIKE Brand licensing business es that are not part of a geographic operating segm ent.  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and ta xes increased $270 million in fiscal 2015, primaril y due to higher operating overhead reflecting conti nued 
investments in operational infrastructure, includin g digital capabilities, consumer engagement and sup ply chain initiatives, as well as higher performanc e-based 
compensation. Demand creation expense increased sli ghtly due to support for the World Cup in the first  quarter of fiscal 2015 and key brand and consumer events.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
For fiscal 2014, Global Brand Divisions' loss befor e interest and taxes increased $277 million, primar ily driven by an increase in centrally managed prod uct costs, 
increased investments in our digital infrastructure , as well as higher demand creation spending in the  fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to support the World  Cup and 
product creation and design initiatives.

Converse  
In territories we define as “direct distribution ma rkets” Converse designs, markets and sells products direct ly to distributors, wholesale customers and to cons umers 
through DTC operations. The largest direct distribu tion markets are the United States, the United King dom and China. Converse does not own the Converse 
trademarks in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by thir d-party licensees who pay royalties to Converse for t he use of 
its registered trademarks and other intellectual pr operty rights.  
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014  
Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, reven ues for Converse increased 21% for fiscal 2015. Com parable direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served 
under a direct distribution model for comparable pe riods in the current and prior fiscal years) grew 1 4%, contributing 12 percentage points of total reve nue growth for 
fiscal 2015. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 12% and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage poi nts of 
Converse comparable direct distribution market reve nue growth. The United States market was the most s ignificant contributor to the growth of comparable direct 
distribution markets due to volume increases with k ey wholesale customers and expansion of our DTC bus iness. Conversion of markets from licensed to direc t 
distribution contributed 8 percentage points of tot al Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2015, driven by conversion of several European markets, most sig nificantly 
AGS (Austria, Germany and Switzerland). Revenues fr om comparable licensed markets increased 8% for fis cal 2015, contributing 1 percentage point of total 
Converse revenue growth.  
EBIT for Converse increased 4% for fiscal 2015 as s trong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense. 
Gross margin decreased 60 basis points primarily du e to transitions of licensed markets to direct dist ribution markets. Selling and administrative expens e increased 
for fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher operating overhead costs resulting from investments in infras tructure to support current and future growth, incl uding market 
transitions, new systems and new headquarters, as w ell as higher intellectual property enforcement cos ts.  
Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013  
Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, reven ues for Converse increased 15% for fiscal 2014. Com parable direct distribution markets grew 13%, 
contributing 10 percentage points of total revenue growth for fiscal 2014, primarily due to strength i n our United States, China and United Kingdom marke ts. 
Comparable direct distribution market unit sales in creased 12% and average selling price per unit cont ributed approximately 1 percentage point of Convers e 
comparable direct distribution market revenue growt h. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct di stribution contributed 4 percentage points of total  Converse 
revenue growth for fiscal 2014. Revenues from compa rable licensed markets increased 8% for fiscal 2014 , contributing 1 percentage point of total Converse  
revenue growth.  
On a reported basis, EBIT at Converse grew 17% for fiscal 2014 as higher revenues and gross margin wer e partially offset by higher selling and administra tive 
expense. Gross margin increased 80 basis points, pr imarily due to growth in higher- margin territories and products within our direct d istribution markets. Selling and 
administrative expense grew faster than revenue for  fiscal 2014 due to higher operating overhead to su pport growth initiatives and DTC expansion, as well  as higher 
demand creation spending.  
Corporate  
Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign cur rency hedge gains and losses related to revenues ge nerated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographi c 
operating segments and Converse but managed through  our central foreign exchange risk management progr am.  
The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consis ts largely of unallocated general and administrativ e expenses, including expenses associated with cent rally 
managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, inclu ding 
stock-based compensation; and certain foreign curre ncy gains and losses.  
In addition to the foreign currency gains and losse s recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currenc y results in Corporate include gains and losses res ulting from 
the difference between actual foreign currency rate s and standard rates used to record non- functional currency denominated product purchases w ithin the NIKE 
Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; r elated foreign currency hedge results; conversion g ains and losses arising from re- measurement of monetary 
assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies ; and certain other foreign currency derivative ins truments.

Overview  
As a global company with significant operations out side the United States, in the normal course of bus iness we are exposed to risk arising from changes i n currency 
exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposu res arise from the recording of transactions denomi nated in non- functional currencies and the translation of 
foreign currency denominated results of operations,  financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollar s.  
Our foreign exchange risk management program is int ended to lessen both the positive and negative effe cts of currency fluctuations on our consolidated re sults of 
operations, financial position and cash flows. We m anage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a p ortfolio basis to address those risks that are mate rial to NIKE, 
Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that e xist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by 
hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts an d options. As described below, the implementation o f the 
NIKE Trading Company ("NTC") and our foreign curren cy adjustment program enhanced our ability to manag e our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natur al 
offsets and currency correlation benefits that exis t within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposure s. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or e ntirely offset the 
impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying n et exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedg ed, our program has the effect of delaying the impa ct of 
exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financi al Statements; the length of the delay is dependent  upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue deriv ative 
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  
Transactional Exposures  
We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency r isk. Our most significant transactional foreign cur rency 
exposures are:  
In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE where as a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.  
 
34  •  a $211 million increase in corporate overhead expen se related to corporate initiatives to support grow th of the business as well as performance- based 
compensation;  
•  a $144 million beneficial change from net foreign c urrency losses to net foreign currency gains, repor ted as a component of Other (income) expense, net ; 
and  
•  an approximate $2 million increase in foreign excha nge losses related to the difference between actual  foreign currency exchange rates and standard 
foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIK E Brand geographic operating segments and Converse,  net of hedge gains; these losses are 
reported as a component of consolidated gross margi n.  
•  a $101 million increase in corporate overhead expen se related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business as well as performance- based 
compensation;  
•  a $90 million increase in net foreign currency loss es, reported as a component of Other (income) expense, net ; and 
•  a $ 56 million decrease in foreign exchange losses rela ted to the difference between actual foreign curren cy exchange rates and standard foreign 
currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a 
component of consolidated gross margin.  
Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices  
•  Product Costs — NIKE’ s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in fore ign currencies in the following ways: 
1.  Product purchases denominated in currencies other t han the functional currency of the transacting enti ty: 
a.  Certain NIKE entities, including those supporting o ur North America, Greater China, Japan and European  geographies, purchase product from 
the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE  branded products from third- party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The  NTC, 
whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respec tive functional currencies. When the NTC 
sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure  for the NTC.  
b.  Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases ge nerate a foreign currency exposure 
for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.  
Table of Contents  
 
For the currency within the factory currency exposu re indices that is the local or functional currency  of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation 
affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third- party. All 
currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. D ollar and the local or functional currency of the f actory, are recognized as embedded derivative 
contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivative s in the 
accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial St atements for additional detail.  
As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S.  Dollar on our non- functional currency denominated product purchases d escribed above, a 
strengthe ning U.S. Dollar against the foreign curr encies within the factory currency exposure indices  decreases NIKE’ s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. 
Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the ind exed foreign currencies increases our inventory cos t.  
Managing Transactional Exposures  
Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management p rogram. We manage these exposures by taking advanta ge 
of natural offsets and currency correlations that e xist within the portfolio and may also elect to use  currency forward and option contracts to hedge a p ortion of the 
remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on p robable forecasted future cash flows, including cer tain product cost purchase exposures, non- functional currency 
denominated external sales and other costs describe d above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash  flow hedges in accordance with the accounting stan dards 
for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of t he embedded derivatives component of the product co st exposures as discussed below.  
Certain currency forward contracts used to manage t he foreign exchange exposure of non- functional currency denominated monetary assets and  liabilities subject 
to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts d iscussed above are not formally designated as hedgi ng instruments under the accounting standards for 
derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fa ir value of these instruments are immediately recog nized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to 
offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measur ement of the related non- functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract 
being hedged.  
Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Finan cial 
Statements for additional description of how the ab ove financial instruments are valued and recorded a s well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives  at each 
reported period end.  
Translational Exposures  
Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functio nal currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuat ions in currency exchange rates create volatility i n our reported 
results as we are required to translate the balance  sheets, operational results and cash flows of thes e subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated r eporting. The 
translation of foreign subsidiaries’ non- U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Do llars for consolidated reporting results in a cumul ative translation 
adjustment to Other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’  Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Stat ements of 
Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign  functional currencies benefits our consolidated ea rnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our c onsolidated 
earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluct uations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $1,171 million and  
$288 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2 014, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange r ate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before 
income taxes was a detriment of approximately $221 million and $ 49 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 201 4, respectively.  
Managing Translational Exposures  
To minimize the impact of translating foreign curre ncy denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dol lars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign su bsidiaries 
use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated  available-for- sale investments. The variable future cash flows as sociated with the purchase and subsequent 
sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at  non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries create s a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for he dge 
accounting under the accounting standards for deriv atives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts an d/or options to mitigate the variability of the for ecasted future 
purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investment s. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument h as the 
effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year f oreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of a vailable-for- sale 
investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.  
 
35  2.  Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign curren cy adjustment program with certain factories. The p rogram is designed to more effectively 
manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of  the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natur al offsets to our existing 
foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our  payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies 
(“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs in curred by the factories in the production of NIKE b randed 
products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.  
•  Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our Western Europe and Central & Easte rn Europe geography revenues, as well as 
a portion of our Converse European operations reven ues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro ( e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a 
subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional cur rency. These sales generate a foreign currency expo sure.  
•  Other Costs — Non- functional currency denominated costs, such as endo rsement contracts, also generate foreign currency r isk, though to a lesser 
extent. In certain cases, the Company has also ente red into other contractual agreements which have pa yments that are indexed to foreign currencies 
and create embedded derivative contracts that are r ecorded at fair value through   Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 17 — Risk Management 
and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Co nsolidated Financial Statements for additional deta il.  
•  Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets  and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and lia bilities, primarily receivables 
and payables, including intercompany receivables an d payables, denominated in currencies other than th eir functional currencies. These balance sheet 
items are subject to re-measurement which may creat e fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.

Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Finan cial 
Statements for additional description of how the ab ove financial instruments are valued and recorded a s well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives  at each 
reported period end.  
We estimate the combination of translation of forei gn currency-denominated profits from our internatio nal businesses and the year-over- year change in foreign 
currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $73 mill ion and $139 million on our Income 
before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, respecti vely.  
Net Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries  
We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchan ge fluctuations on our investments in wholly- owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currenc y other than 
the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U .S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore  the value of future repatriated earnings. We have,  in the past, 
hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment  positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitig ate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on  these net 
investments. These hedges are accounted for in acco rdance with the accounting standards for net invest ment hedges. There were no outstanding net investme nt 
hedges as of May 31, 2015 and 2014. There were no c ash flows from net investment hedge settlements for  the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014.  
Cash Flow Activity  
Cash provided by operations was $4,680 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $3,0 13 million for fiscal 2014 . Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2015 
was Net income of $3,273 million . Our fiscal 2015 change in worki ng capital was a net cash inflow of $256 million as  compared to a net cash outflow of $488 million 
for fiscal 2014 . Our investments in working capita l decreased due to increases in Accrued liabilities , primarily resulting from the receipt of $968 mill ion of cash 
collateral from counterparties as a result of hedgi ng activity. These amounts were partially offset by  higher inventory levels resulting from business gr owth and West 
Coast port delays in North America, as well as lowe r Income taxes payable as a result of tax payments made in fiscal 2015 fol lowing the U.S. Unilateral Advance 
Pricing Agreement reached with the IRS in fiscal 20 14.  
Cash used by investing activities was $175 million for fiscal 2015 , compared to a $1 ,207 million use of cash for fiscal 2014 . The primary driver of the decrease in 
Cash used by investing activities was the net change in short- term investments (including sales, maturities and p urchases) from net purchases to net 
sales/maturities. In fiscal 2015, there were $935 m illion of net sales/maturities compared to $328 mil lion of net purchases of short- term investments in the same 
period of fiscal 2014. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $963 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to $88 0 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in 
Additions to property, plant and equipment resulted from continued investments in infrastructu re to support current and future growth, primarily relating to expansion 
of our DTC operations as well as supply chain and c orporate initiatives.  
In fiscal 2016, we plan to continue investing in ou r infrastructure to support future growth, as well as expand our digital capabilities. We anticipate i nvesting 
approximately 4% of revenue, a portion of which wil l be used for the continued expansion of our corpor ate facilities, new DTC stores and digital capabili ties.  
Cash used by financing activities was $2,790 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $2,9 14 million for fiscal 2014 , a decrease of $124 million, as increased dividend s 
were more than offset by an increase in proceeds fr om the exercise of stock options and the excess tax  benefits from share -based payment arrangements.  
In fiscal 2015 , we purchased 29.0 million shares o f NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $2,534 million , an average price of $ 87.37 . During fiscal 2013, we 
completed the four- year, $5 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Under that program, we purchased a total of 
118.8 million shares at an average price of $42.08.  Subsequently, we began repurchases under a four- year, $8 billion program approved by the Board in S eptember 
2012. As of the end of fiscal 2015 , we had repurch ased 80.9 million shares at an average price of $73 .55 for a total cost of $5,950 million under this current 
program. We continue to expect funding of share rep urchases will come from operating cash flow, excess  cash and/or debt. The timing and the amount of sha res 
purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and  stock market conditions.  
Capital Resources  
On April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration st atement (the "Shelf") with the SEC which permits us  to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. T he Shelf 
expires on April 23, 2016. On April 23, 2013, we is sued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches mat uring in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in 
an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 milli on at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were i ssued in an 
initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will ma ture on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes i s payable 
semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year.  The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before exp enses of $998 million.  
On November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed cr edit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks w hich provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings wi th the 
option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. The facility matures November 1, 2 017. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2015 a nd 2014 , 
we had no amounts outstanding under our committed c redit facility.  
We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and  A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody' s Investor Services, respectively. If our long- term debt 
ratings were to decline, the facility fee and inter est rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long- term debt rating were to improve, 
the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trig ger acceleration of maturity of any then- outstanding borrowings 
or any future borrowings under the committed credit  facility. Under this committed revolving credit fa cility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants 
include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the  amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as w ell as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event  we were to 
have any borrowings outstanding under this facility  and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable t o obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in t he 
syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2015 , we were in full compliance with each of these cov enants and believe it 
is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these coven ants in the foreseeable future.  
 
36  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
Table of Contents  
 
Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commer cial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2 015 , we did not issue commercial paper, and as of May 31, 
2015 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this p rogram. We may issue commercial paper or other debt  securities during fiscal 2016 depending on general  
corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corp oration and Moody's Investor Services, respectively .  
As of May 31, 2015 , we had cash, cash equivalents and sh ort-term investments totaling $5.9 billion , of whi ch $4.2 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Included in Cash and equivalents as of May 31, 2015 was $968 million of cash collate ral received from counterparties as a result of hed ging activity. Cash 
equivalents and Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate not es, U.S. Treasury 
obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise o bligations and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are expose d to 
both credit and interest rate risk. All of our inve stments are investment grade to minimize our credit  risk. While individual securities have varying dur ations, as of 
May 31, 2015 the weighted average remaining duratio n of our short-term investments and cash equivalent s portfolio was 79  days.  
To date we have not experienced difficulty accessin g the credit markets or incurred higher interest co sts. Future volatility in the capital markets, howe ver, may 
increase costs associated with issuing commercial p aper or other debt instruments or affect our abilit y to access those markets. We believe that existing  cash, cash 
equivalents, short- term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds a s described above, will be sufficient to 
meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.  
We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routin ely 
repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for wh ich U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We al so indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of o ur foreign 
earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we requ ire additional capital in the United States, we may  elect to 
repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or  raise capital in the United States through debt. I f we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested for eign funds, we 
would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S.  taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we e lect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would 
incur additional interest expense .  
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
In connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights,  coverage for 
legal issues that arise and other items where we ar e acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have sever al such agreements in place. However, based on our 
historical experience and the estimated probability  of future loss, we have determined that the fair v alue of such indemnification is not material to our  financial 
position or results of operations.  
Contractual Obligations  
Our significant long-term contractual obligations a s of May 31, 2015 and significant endorsement contracts, including re lated marketing commitments, entered into 
through the date of this report are as follows:  
In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for thei r use. It is not possible to determine how much we will 
spend on this product on an annual basis as the con tracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount  of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of 
product provided to the endorsers will depend on ma ny factors, including general playing conditions, t he number of sporting events in which they particip ate 
and our own decisions regarding product and marketi ng initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, d evelop, source and purchase the products furnished to the 
endorsers are incurred over a period of time and ar e not necessarily tracked separately from similar c osts incurred for products sold to customers.

(1)  The cash payments due for long- term debt include estimated interest payments. Esti mates of interest payments are based on outstanding  principal amounts, 
applicable fixed interest rates or currently effect ive interest rates as of May 31, 2015 (if variable) , timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt 
obligations.  
(2)  The amounts listed for endorsement contracts repres ent approximate amounts of base compensation and mi nimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated 
to pay athlete, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these 
contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the end orsers based upon athletic achievements and/or roya lties on product sales in future periods. Actual 
payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced paym ents if athletic performance declines in future 
periods.  
(3)  We generally order product at least four to five mo nths in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for 
product purchase obligations represent agreements ( including open purchase orders) to purchase product s in the ordinary course of business that are 
enforceable and legally binding and that specify al l significant terms. In some cases, prices are subj ect to change throughout the production process. Th e 
reported amounts exclude product purchase liabiliti es included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated  Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2015 .  
(4)  Other amounts primarily include service and marketi ng commitments, including marketing commitments ass ociated with endorsement contracts, made in the 
ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding co ntracts and agreements that specify all significant  
terms, including open purchase orders for non- product purchases. The reported amounts exclude tho se liabilities included in Accounts payable or Accr ued 
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of  May 31, 2015 .

The total liability for uncertain tax positions was  $438 million , excluding related interest and pena lties, at May 31, 2015 . We are not able to reasonably estimate 
when or if cash payments of the long -term liability for uncertain tax positions will oc cur.  
We also have the following outstanding short-term d ebt obligations as of May 31, 2015 . Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the 
accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial St atements for further description and interest rates  related to the short-term debt obligations listed below.  
As of May 31, 2015 , the Company had letters of credit ou tstanding totaling $165 million . These letters of credit were issued primarily for  the purchase of inventory 
and as guarantees of the Company’s performance unde r certain self-insurance and other programs.  
In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Bo ard (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update intended to p rovide guidance on the presentation of 
unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting the manner in  which an entity would settle, at the reporting dat e, any additional income taxes that would result fr om the 
disallowance of a tax position when net operating l oss carryforwards, similar tax losses or tax credit  carryforwards exist. This accounting standard was effective for 
us beginning June 1, 2014 and early adoption was pe rmitted. We early adopted this guidance and the ado ption did not have a material impact on our consoli dated 
financial position or results of operations.  
In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standar ds update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite- lived intangible assets other than goodwill for 
impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine wheth er further impairment testing is necessary. This ac counting 
standard update was effective for us beginning June  1, 2013. The adoption of this standard did not hav e a material impact on our consolidated financial p osition or 
results of operations.  
In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancin g disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of  an entity’ s right to offset and related arrangements 
associated with its financial instruments and deriv ative instruments. This new guidance requires compa nies to disclose both gross and net information abo ut 
instruments and transactions eligible for offset in  the statement of financial position and instrument s and transactions subject to master netting arrang ements. This 
new guidance was effective for us beginning June 1,  2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disc losures, the adoption had no impact on our consolid ated 
financial position or results of operations.  
In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard s update that replaces existing revenue recognition  guidance. The updated guidance requires companies to 
recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfe r of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the  entity 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires  that reporting companies disclose the nature, amou nt, timing 
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising f rom contracts with customers. Based on the FASB's d ecision in July 2015 to defer the effective date an d to allow 
more flexibility with implementation, we anticipate  the new standard will be effective for us beginnin g June 1, 2018. The new standard is required to be applied 
retrospectively to each prior reporting period pres ented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect  of initially applying it recognized at the date of  initial application. 
We have not yet selected a transition method and ar e currently evaluating the effect the guidance will  have on our consolidated financial position or res ults of 
operations.  
Our previous discussion and analysis of our financi al condition and results of operations are based up on our consolidated financial statements, which hav e been 
prepared in accordance with accounting principles g enerally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requi res us to 
make estimates and judgments that affect the report ed amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and exp enses and related disclosure of contingent assets a nd 
liabilities.  
We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judg ments involved in the accounting policies described  below have the greatest potential impact on our fi nancial 
statements, so we consider these to be our critical  accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty in herent in these matters, actual results could diffe r from the 
estimates we use in applying the critical accountin g policies. Certain of these critical accounting po licies affect working capital account balances, inc luding the 
policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for  uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reser ves and contingent payments under endorsement contr acts. 
These policies require that we make estimates in th e preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. Howeve r, since our business cycle is relatively short, 
actual results related to these estimates are gener ally known within the six- month period following the financial statement date . Thus, these policies generally affect 
only the timing of reported amounts across two to t hree fiscal quarters.  
Within the context of these critical accounting pol icies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably  likely events or circumstances that would result i n materially 
different amounts being reported.  
Revenue Recognition  
We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to t he customer, based on the terms of sale. Title pass es 
generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the cust omer depending on the country of the sale and the a greement with the customer. Retail store revenues a re 
recorded at the time of sale and online store reven ues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.

In some instances, we ship product directly from ou r supplier to the customer and recognize revenue wh en the product is delivered to and accepted by the 
customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product f or periods of up to several weeks.  
In certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt b y the customer is not readily available. In these c ases, we 
estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic locati on. On the basis of our tests of actual transaction s, we have no 
indication that these estimates have been materiall y inaccurate historically.  
As part of our revenue recognition policy, we recor d estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellane ous claims from customers as reductions to revenues  at the 
time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with cert ain customers or discretionary discounts that are e xpected to 
be granted to certain customers at a later date. We  base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identificat ion of 
outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and estimated returns, disc ounts and claims expected but not yet finalized wit h our 
customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus  may differ from our estimates. If actual or expect ed future 
returns, discounts and claims were significantly gr eater or lower than the reserves we had established , we would record a reduction or increase to net re venues in 
the period in which we made such determination.  
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable  
We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability t o collect our accounts receivable and maintain an a llowance for estimated losses resulting from the in ability of our 
customers to make required payments. In determining  the amount of the allowance, we consider our histo rical level of credit losses and make judgments abo ut the 
creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict  future changes in the financial stability of our c ustomers, 
actual future losses from uncollectible accounts ma y differ from our estimates. If the financial condi tion of our customers were to deteriorate, resultin g in their 
inability to make payments, a larger allowance migh t be required. In the event we determine that a sma ller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would r ecord a 
credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made .  
Inventory Reserves  
We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assu mptions about future demand and market conditions. If we 
estimate that the net realizable value of our inven tory is less than the cost of the inventory recorde d on our books, we record a reserve equal to the di fference 
between the cost of the inventory and the estimated  net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales . If changes in market conditions 
result in reductions in the estimated net realizabl e value of our inventory below our previous estimat e, we would increase our reserve in the period in w hich we made 
such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales .   
Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts  
A significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In  general, endorsement payments are expensed uniform ly 
over the term of the contract. However, certain con tract elements may be accounted for differently, ba sed upon the facts and circumstances of each indivi dual 
contract.  
Certain contracts provide for contingent payments t o endorsers based upon specific achievements in the ir sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record  demand 
creation expense for these amounts when the endorse r achieves the specific goal.  
Certain contracts provide for variable payments bas ed upon endorsers maintaining a level of performanc e in their sport over an extended period of time (e .g., 
maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a ye ar). When we determine payments are probable, the a mounts are recorded in Demand creation expense ratably 
over the contract period based on our best estimate  of the endorser's performance. In these instances,  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser  differ from 
our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s perfo rmance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.  
Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to e ndorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sale s of particular products. We expense these payments  in 
Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, w e offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For co ntracts for which we estimate we will not meet 
the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees throu gh sales of product, we record the amount of the gu aranteed payment in excess of that earned through s ales 
of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the guarantee period.  
Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived As sets  
Property, plant and equipment, including buildings,  equipment and computer hardware and software are r ecorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost  of 
internal labor) and are depreciated over the estima ted useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business 
operations) can result in differences between the a ctual and estimated useful lives. In those cases wh ere we determine that the useful life of a long- lived asset 
should be shortened, we increase depreciation expen se over the remaining useful life to depreciate the  asset’s net book value to its salvage value.  
We review the carrying value of long- lived assets or asset groups to be used in operatio ns whenever events or changes in circumstances indi cate that the carrying 
amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Fact ors that would necessitate an impairment assessment  include a significant adverse change in the extent  or 
manner in which an asset is used, a significant adv erse change in legal factors or the business climat e that could affect the value of the asset or a sig nificant decline 
in the observable market value of an asset, among o thers. If such facts indicate a potential impairmen t, we would assess the recoverability of an asset g roup by 
determining if the carrying value of the asset grou p exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cas h flows expected to result from the use and eventua l 
disposition of the assets over the remaining econom ic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If  the recoverability test indicates that the carryin g value of the 
asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate th e fair value of the asset group using appropriate v aluation methodologies that would typically include  an estimate 
of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be m easured as the difference between the asset group’s  carrying amount and its estimated fair value.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets  
We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the four th quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occu r or 
circumstances change that would, more likely than n ot, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an  intangible asset with an indefinite life below its  carrying value. 
Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger  interim impairment reviews include significant cha nges in business climate, operating results, planne d 
investments in the reporting unit, planned divestit ures or an expectation that the carrying amount may  not be recoverable, among other factors. We may fi rst assess 
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more  likely than not that the fair value of a reporting  unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after a ssessing the totality of 
events and circumstances, we determine that it is m ore likely than not that the fair value of the repo rting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the  two-step 
impairment test is unnecessary. The two- step impairment test requires us to estimate the fa ir value of our reporting units. If the carrying va lue of a reporting unit 
exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that report ing unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of  the analysis, we 
measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit' s goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.  
We generally base our measurement of the fair value  of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the p resent value of future discounted cash flows and th e market 
valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model  indicates the fair value of the reporting unit bas ed on the present value of the cash flows that we e xpect the 
reporting unit to generate in the future. Our signi ficant estimates in the discounted cash flows model  include: our weighted average cost of capital; lon g-term rate of 
growth and profitability of the reporting unit's bu siness; and working capital effects. The market val uation approach indicates the fair value of the bus iness based on 
a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable pu blicly traded companies in similar lines of busines s. Significant estimates in the market valuation ap proach 
model include identifying similar companies with co mparable business factors such as size, growth, pro fitability, risk and return on investment, and asse ssing 
comparable revenue and operating income multiples i n estimating the fair value of the reporting unit.  
Indefinite- lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquir ed trade names and trademarks. We may first perform  a qualitative assessment to determine whether it i s 
more likely than not that an indefinite- lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after asses sing the totality of events and circumstances, we d etermine that it is more likely 
than not that the indefinite- lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantita tive fair value measurement is necessary. If a quan titative fair value measurement 
calculation is required for these intangible assets , we utilize the relief-from- royalty method. This method assumes that trade name s and trademarks have value to 
the extent that their owner is relieved of the obli gation to pay royalties for the benefits received f rom them. This method requires us to estimate the f uture revenue for 
the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate an d the weighted average cost of capital.  
Fair Value Measurements  
For financial assets and liabilities measured at fa ir value on a recurring basis, fair value is the pr ice we would receive to sell an asset or pay to tra nsfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction with a market participant at  the measurement date. In general, and where applic able, we use quoted prices in active markets for id entical 
assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodol ogy applies to our Level 1 investments, including U .S. Treasury 
securities.  
In the absence of active markets for identical asse ts or liabilities, such measurements involve develo ping assumptions based on market observable data, i ncluding 
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or s imilar assets or liabilities in markets that are no t active. This pricing 
methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such  as time deposits, commercial paper and bonds, U.S.  Agency securities and money market funds.   
Level 3 investments are valued using internally dev eloped models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an 
immaterial portion of our portfolio.  
A majority of our available -for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and a re generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as thes e vendors either provide a 
quoted market price in an active market or use obse rvable inputs without applying significant adjustme nts in their pricing. Observable inputs include bro ker quotes, 
interest rates and yield curves observable at commo nly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks . Our fair value processes include controls that ar e designed to 
ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include a comparison to another independen t pricing vendor.  
Hedge Accounting for Derivatives  
We use derivative contracts to hedge certain antici pated foreign currency and interest rate transactio ns as well as certain non- functional currency monetary assets 
and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qual ify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in t he fair value of contracts hedging probable forecas ted future cash 
flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income , rather than Net income , until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income . In most cases, this results 
in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being rele ased from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the 
criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should  not be in excess of specifically identified antici pated transactions. 
By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultima tely vary from actual transactions. When anticipate d 
transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts  decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer  probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of 
the originally specified time period or within an a dditional two- month period of time thereafter, we are required to  reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the 
over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract f rom Other comprehensive income to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease 
occurs.  
We have, in the past, used and may, in the future u se, forward contracts or options to hedge our inves tment in the net assets of certain international su bsidiaries to 
offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in  fair value of the forward contracts or options hed ging our net 
investments is reported in the cumulative translati on adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income within Total shareholders’ equity , to the 
extent effective, to offset the foreign currency tr anslation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly- owned 
international subsidiaries is known at the time a h edge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordin gly, the 
variability involved in net investment hedges is su bstantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material inef fectiveness. 
We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to rede signate existing hedge relationships based on chang es in the underlying net investment. Should the lev el of our 
net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cu mulative change in fair value of the over- hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as 
Other (income) expense, net during the period in which changes occur.

Stock-based Compensation  
We account for stock-based compensation by estimati ng the fair value of stock-based compensation on th e date of grant using the Black- Scholes option pricing 
model. The Black- Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility.  Expected volatility is estimated based on 
implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, alo ng with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was 
based on the availability of actively traded option s on our common stock and our assessment that impli ed volatility is more representative of future stoc k price trends 
than historical volatility. If factors change and w e use different assumptions for estimating stock-ba sed compensation expense in future periods, stock- based 
compensation expense may differ materially in the f uture from that recorded in the current period.  
Income Taxes  
We record valuation allowances against our deferred  tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferre d tax assets (such as net operating loss carry- forwards) is 
dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefo re uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the lik elihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be  recovered 
from future taxable income. To the extent we believ e that recovery is not likely, we establish a valua tion allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which 
increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.  
In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax e xpense for foreign earnings that we have determined  to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United S tates, thus 
reducing our overall Income tax expense . The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely  reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deplo yment of such 
earnings in our offshore assets and our expectation s of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a fact or in 
determining the amount of foreign earnings to be in definitely reinvested offshore.  
We carefully review all factors that drive the ulti mate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standard s to overcome 
the presumption of repatriation. Despite this appro ach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possib ility exists 
that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested of fshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance,  the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exc eed our 
current expectations, or the actual cash needs of o ur foreign entities may be less than our current ex pectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense 
in the year we determined that amounts were no long er indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, ou r approach may also result in a determination that 
accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income  taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely rei nvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense would 
be reduced in the year of such determination.  
On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective  tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This es timated annual effective tax rate is then applied t o the year-to- date 
Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense . The income tax effects of 
infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the i nterim period in which they occur. As the fiscal ye ar progresses, we continually refine our estimate b ased upon 
actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during t he year. This continual estimation process periodic ally results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the 
fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income  tax provision during the quarter in which the chan ge in estimate occurs.  
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability t hat a tax position will be effectively sustained an d the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax 
positions based on factors including changes in fac ts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled au dit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our a ssessment 
may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or a n additional charge to the tax provision in the per iod our assessment changes. We recognize interest a nd penalties 
related to income tax matters in Income tax expense .  
Other Contingencies  
In the ordinary course of business, we are involved  in legal proceedings regarding contractual and emp loyment relationships, product liability claims, tr ademark 
rights and a variety of other matters. We record co ntingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is a ssessed to be 
probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably e stimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimat ing probable losses requires analysis of multiple f actors, 
including in some cases judgments about the potenti al actions of third- party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent lia bilities are based on the best information 
available and actual losses in any future period ar e inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to es timated probable future losses or actual losses exc eed our 
recorded liability for such claims, we would record  additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addi tion to

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures a bout Market 
Risk  
In the normal course of business and consistent wit h established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure  to 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and  interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finan ce our business 
and manage such exposures; we do not enter into the se transactions for trading or speculative purposes .  
We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, pr imarily as a result of our international sales, pro duct sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign e xchange risk 
management program is intended to lessen both the p ositive and negative effects of currency fluctuatio ns on our consolidated results of operations, finan cial 
position and cash flows. We use forward and options  contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet  firmly committed transactions as well as certain f irm 
commitments and the related receivables and payable s, including third- party and intercompany transactions. We have, in th e past, and may, in the future, also use 
forward or options contracts to hedge our investmen t in the net assets of certain international subsid iaries to offset foreign currency translation adjus tments related 
to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of  delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our 
Consolidated Financial Statements.  
The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the ty pe and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined b ased 
upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing mark et conditions. Typically, the Company may enter int o hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance 
of the forecasted transaction and may place increme ntal hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transact ion occurs. The majority of 
derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2015 are desi gnated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for  Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese 
Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. See section “Foreig n Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices” under I tem 7 for additional detail.  
Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short - and long- term market interest rates. Our objective in managi ng this interest rate exposure is to limit the 
impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cas h flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To a chieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of comme rcial 
paper, bank loans, fixed-rate debt of varying matur ities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-vari able interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed -rate debt as 
well as pay -fixed, receive-variable forward-starting interest rate swaps for cash outflows of interest payments o n future debt.  
We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate ris k and related derivatives using a variety of techni ques including a review of market value, sensitivit y analysis and 
Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market- sensitive derivative and other financial instrument s are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign c urrency option contracts, 
interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated  in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dol lar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japane se 
Yen denominated debt.  
We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency o ption derivative instruments only. The VaR determin es the 
maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of  these foreign exchange rate- sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model esti mates assume normal market 
conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are va rious modeling techniques that can be used in the V aR computation. Our computations are based on 
interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function  of foreign exchange currency 
market changes and interest rate changes over the p receding one year period. The value of foreign curr ency options does not change on a one-to- one basis with 
changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimate d sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the 
underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects  the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations o n the derivative instruments only and does not incl ude the impact 
of such rate fluctuations on non- functional currency transactions (such as anticipat ed transactions, firm commitments, cash balances an d accounts and loans 
receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.  
The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value th at we will incur nor does it consider the potential  effect of 
favorable changes in market rates. It also does not  represent the full extent of the possible loss tha t may occur. Actual future gains and losses will di ffer from those 
estimated because of changes or differences in mark et rates and interrelationships, hedging instrument s and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.  
The estimated maximum one- day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sens itive derivative financial instruments, derived usi ng the VaR model, was $117 million 
and $50 million at May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectiv ely. The VaR increased year-over- year as a result of an increase in the total notion al value of our foreign 
currency derivative portfolio, a longer weighted av erage duration on our outstanding trades and an inc rease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2 015. Such a 
hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivati ves would be offset by increases in the value of th e underlying transactions being hedged. The average  monthly 
change in the fair values of foreign currency forwa rd and foreign currency option derivative instrumen ts was $205 million and $70 million during fiscal 2 015 and fiscal 
2014, respectively.  
The instruments not included in the VaR are interco mpany loans denominated in non- functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese  Yen denominated debt, 
fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt an d interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and relat ed interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation . 
Furthermore, our non- functional currency intercompany loans are substant ially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are 
included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, w e consider the interest rate and foreign currency m arket risks associated with our non- functional currency 
intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolid ated financial position, results from operations an d cash flows.  
During the year ended May 31, 2015, we entered into  a series of forward-starting interest rate swap ag reements. A forward- starting interest rate swap is an 
agreement that effectively hedges the variability i n future benchmark interest payments attributable t o changes in interest rates on the forecasted issua nce of fixed-
rate debt. We entered into these forward- starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fi xed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of de bt. These instruments 
were designated as cash flow hedges of the variabil ity in the expected cash outflows of interest payme nts on future debt due to changes in benchmark inte rest 
rates.  
Details of third- party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest 
rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floati ng rate debt reflect the effective interest rates a t May 31, 2015.

Management is responsible for establishing and main taining adequate internal control over financial re porting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 
15(d) - 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as am ended. Internal control over financial reporting is  a process designed to provide reasonable assurance  
regarding the reliability of financial reporting an d the preparation of the financial statements for e xternal purposes in accordance with generally accep ted accounting 
principles in the United States of America. Interna l control over financial reporting includes those p olicies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the mai ntenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of  assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable ass urance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit pr eparation of financial statements in accordance wit h generally accepted accounting principles, and tha t receipts 
and expenditures of the Company are being made only  in accordance with authorizations of our managemen t and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assur ance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unautho rized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on th e financial 
statements.  
While “reasonable assurance” is a high level of assurance, it does not mean abso lute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations , internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatem ent and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible  to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by 
the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluat ion of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of chan ges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance  with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
Under the supervision and with the participation of  our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Of ficer, our management conducted an evaluation of th e 
effectiveness of our internal control over financia l reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commiss ion (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation,  our management concluded that our internal control  
over financial reporting was effective as of May 31 , 2015 .  
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent register ed public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Cons olidated Financial Statements and (2) the effective ness of 
our internal control over financial reporting as of  May 31, 2015 , as stated in their report herein.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NIKE,  Inc.:  
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statemen ts listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1 ) present fairly, in all material respects, the fin ancial position of 
NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries at May 31, 2015 and  2014 , and the results of their operations and their cas h flows for each of the three years in the period e nded 
May 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In additi on, in our opinion, the financial statement 
schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 1 5(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conj unction with the 
related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all materia l respects, effective internal control over financi al reporting as 
of May 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the 
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’ s management is responsible for these financial sta tements and financial statement schedule, for maint aining 
effective internal control over financial reporting  and for its assessment of the effectiveness of int ernal control over financial reporting, included in  Management’ s 
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Re porting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statement s, on the 
financial statement schedule and on the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting based o n our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in  accordance 
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (United States). Those standards r equire that we plan and perform the audits to obtai n 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial st atements are free of material misstatement and whet her effective internal control over financial repor ting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a t est basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disc losures in 
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by m anagement and evaluating the overall financial stat ement 
presentation. Our audit of internal control over fi nancial reporting included obtaining an understandi ng of internal control over financial reporting, as sessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists and testing and eva luating the design and operating effectiveness of i nternal control based on the assessed risk. Our aud its also 
included performing such other procedures as we con sidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our 
opinions.  
A company ’s internal control over financial reporting is a pr ocess designed to provide reasonable assurance rega rding the reliability of financial reporting and th e 
preparation of financial statements for external pu rposes in accordance with generally accepted accoun ting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures th at (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are  recorded as necessary to permit preparation of fin ancial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted ac counting principles, and that receipts and expendit ures of the Company are being made only in accordan ce 
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauth orized 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s a ssets that could have a material effect on the fina ncial statements.  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal contr ol over financial reporting may not prevent or dete ct misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluati on of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compl iance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Operating results of the Converse brand are reporte d on a stand-alone basis.  
Basis of Consolidation  
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the a ccounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Co mpany”). All significant intercompany transactions and 
balances have been eliminated.  
The Company completed the sale of Cole Haan during the third quarter ended February 28, 2013 and compl eted the sale of Umbro during the second quarter en ded 
November 30, 2012. As a result, the Company reports  the operating results of Cole Haan and Umbro in th e Net income from discontinued operations line in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income for all applicabl e periods presented. There were no assets or liabil ities of discontinued operations as of May 31, 2015  and 
May 31, 2014 (refer to Note 15 — Discontinued Opera tions ). Unless otherwise indicated, the disclosures acco mpanying the Consolidated Financial Statements 
reflect the Company’s continuing operations.  
On November 15, 2012, the Company announced a two - for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Comm on shares. The stock split was a 100 percent stock 
dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholde rs of record at the close of business on December 1 0, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-
adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numb ers and per share amounts presented reflect the sto ck split.  
Reclassifications  
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified t o conform to fiscal 2015 presentation.  
Revisions  
During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, management  determined it had incorrectly reflected unrealized  gains and losses from re-measurement of non- functional 
currency intercompany balances between certain of i ts foreign wholly- owned subsidiaries in its Consolidated Statements o f Cash Flows. These unrealized gains and 
losses should have been classified as non-cash reco nciling items from Net income to Cash provided by operations , but were instead reported on the Effect of 
exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents line of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This resulted in an understatement of Cash provided by 
operations reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flo ws for certain prior periods; there was no impact f or any period to Net increase (decrease) in cash 
and equivalents reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flo ws, or Cash and equivalents reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flo ws and 
Balance Sheets. The Company assessed the materialit y of the misclassifications on prior periods' finan cial statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accoun ting 
Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 99, Materiality, codified in A ccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 250, Presentation of Financial Statements, and conc luded that these 
misstatements were not material to any prior annual  or interim periods. Accordingly, in accordance wit h ASC 250 (SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior 
Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements i n Current Year Financial Statements), the amounts h ave been revised in the applicable Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows. For the three and six mon ths ended August 31, 2014 and November 30, 2014 of fiscal 2015, the revisions increased Cash provided by 
operations and decreased Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equival ents by $95 million and $312 million , respectively. For the fiscal years ended May 
31, 2014 and 2013, the revisions increased Cash provided by operations and decreased Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equival ents by $10 million 
and $64 million , respectively. These amounts have been reflected i n the applicable tables below. As part of the revis ion to the Consolidated Statements of Cash 
Flows, the Company has updated its presentation to separately report Net foreign currency adjustments , which was previously included within Amortization and 
other .

The following are selected line items from the Comp any's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows illustr ating the effect of these corrections on the amount s 
previously reported in the Company's fiscal 2014 An nual Report on Form 10-K:  
Recognition of Revenues  
Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and th e risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the  customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon 
shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with t he customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time 
of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon  delivery to the customer. Provisions for post- invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from 
customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction  to revenue at the time of sale. Post- invoice sales discounts consist of contractual prog rams with certain 
customers or discretionary discounts that are expec ted to be granted to certain customers at a later d ate. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims 
are based on historical rates, specific identificat ion of outstanding claims and outstanding returns n ot yet received from customers and estimated discou nts, returns 
and claims expected, but not yet finalized with cus tomers. As of May 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company’s  reserve balances for post- invoice sales discounts, returns 
and miscellaneous claims were $724 million and $610  million , respectively.  
Cost of Sales  
Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as w arehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse l abor), third- party royalties, certain foreign 
currency hedge gains and losses and research, desig n and development costs.  
Shipping and Handling Costs  
Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed a s incurred and included in Cost of sales .

Operating Overhead Expense  
Operating overhead expense consists primarily of payroll and benefit related c osts, rent, depreciation and amortization, professi onal services and meetings and 
travel.  
Demand Creation Expense  
Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, includ ing costs of endorsement contracts, television, dig ital and print advertising, brand 
events and retail brand presentation. Advertising p roduction costs are expensed the first time an adve rtisement is run. Advertising communication costs a re 
expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs rela ted to brand events are expensed when the event occ urs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are  
expensed when the presentation is completed and del ivered.  
A significant amount of the Company ’s promotional expenses result from payments under e ndorsement contracts. Accounting for endorsement pa yments is based 
upon specific contract provisions. Generally, endor sement payments are expensed on a straight- line basis over the term of the contract after givi ng recognition to 
periodic performance compliance provisions of the c ontracts. Prepayments made under contracts are incl uded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or 
Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment app lies.  
Certain contracts provide for contingent payments t o endorsers based upon specific achievements in the ir sports (e.g., winning a championship). The Compa ny 
records demand creation expense for these amounts w hen the endorser achieves the specific goal.  
Certain contracts provide for variable payments bas ed upon endorsers maintaining a level of performanc e in their sport over an extended period of time (e .g., 
maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a ye ar). When the Company determines payments are proba ble, the amounts are reported in demand creation ex pense 
ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these in stances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser 
differ from the Company's estimate due to changes i n the endorser’ s performance, increased or decreased demand creati on expense may be recorded in a future 
period.  
Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to e ndorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sale s of particular products. The Company expenses thes e 
payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, t he Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty paymen ts. For contracts for which the 
Company estimates it will not meet the minimum guar anteed amount of royalty fees through sales of prod uct, the Company records the amount of the guarante ed 
payment in excess of that earned through sales of p roduct in Demand creation expense uniformly over the guarantee period.  
Through cooperative advertising programs, the Compa ny reimburses retail customers for certain costs of  advertising the Company’ s products. The Company 
records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its cu stomers for the costs. This obligation may arise pr ior to the related 
advertisement being run.  
Total advertising and promotion expenses were $3,21 3 million , $3,031 million and $2,745 million for t he years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 
Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $455 million and $516 million at May 31, 2015 and 2 014 , respectively, and were recorded in Prepaid expenses 
and other current assets and Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment app lies.  
Cash and Equivalents  
Cash and equivalents represent cash and short- term, highly liquid investments, including commerci al paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market funds, time 
deposits and corporate debt securities with maturit ies of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.  
Short-Term Investments  
Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including com mercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency and corpo rate debt securities, with maturities 
over 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securiti es that the Company has the ability and positive in tent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized c ost. At 
May 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company did not hold an y short-term investments that were classified as tr ading or held-to-maturity.  
At May 31, 2015 and 2014 , Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Availab le-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unr ealized 
gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Other comprehensive income , unless unrealized losses are determined to be oth er than temporary. Realized gains and 
losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for- sale securities, including those with maturity date s 
beyond 12 months, as available to support current o perational liquidity needs and therefore classifies  all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of 
purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company’s short-term investments .  
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable  
Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts r eceivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing  estimates relating to the collectability of its ac counts 
receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated  losses resulting from the inability of its custome rs to make required payments. In determining the am ount of the 
allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the cred itworthiness of significant customers based on ongo ing 
credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with antici pated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are c onsidered 
non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets . The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivab le was $78 million and $78 million at 
May 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, of which $24 million and $37 million , respectively, was classif ied as long-term and recorded in Deferred income taxes and 
other assets .

Inventory Valuation  
Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on  either an average or specific identification cost basis. For inventories in transit that represent di rect 
shipments to customers, the related inventory and c ost of sales are recognized on a specific identific ation basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of p roduct cost 
from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound fr eight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistic s and other handling fees.  
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation  
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basi s for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 t o 40 years 
and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.   
Depreciation and amortization of assets used in man ufacturing, warehousing and product distribution ar e recorded in Cost of sales . Depreciation and amortization 
of other assets are recorded in Total selling and administrative expense .  
Software Development Costs  
Internal Use Software . Expenditures for major software purchases and sof tware developed for internal use are capitalized an d amortized over a 2 to 10 year period 
on a straight-line basis. The Company’ s policy provides for the capitalization of externa l direct costs of materials and services associated  with developing or 
obtaining internal use computer software. In additi on, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll an d payroll- related costs for employees who are directly 
associated with internal use computer software proj ects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs wit h respect to these employees is limited to the time  directly 
spent on such projects. Costs associated with preli minary project stage activities, training, maintena nce and all other post- implementation stage activities are 
expensed as incurred.  
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise M arketed . Development costs of computer software to be sold , leased or otherwise marketed as an integral 
part of a product are subject to capitalization beg inning when a product’ s technological feasibility has been established an d ending when a product is available for 
general release to customers. In most instances, th e Company’ s products are released soon after technological fe asibility has been established. Therefore, software  
development costs incurred subsequent to achievemen t of technological feasibility are usually not sign ificant, and generally most software development co sts have 
been expensed as incurred.  
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  
The Company reviews the carrying value of long- lived assets or asset groups to be used in operatio ns whenever events or changes in circumstances indi cate that 
the carrying amount of the assets might not be reco verable. Factors that would necessitate an impairme nt assessment include a significant adverse change in the 
extent or manner in which an asset is used, a signi ficant adverse change in legal factors or the busin ess climate that could affect the value of the asse t or a 
significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a  potential impairment, the Company would assess the  
recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the s um of the projected undiscounted cash flows expecte d to result 
from the use and eventual disposition of the assets  over the remaining economic life of the primary as set in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that 
the carrying value of the asset group is not recove rable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodo logies, 
which would typically include an estimate of discou nted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured a s the difference between the asset group ’s carrying 
amount and its estimated fair value.  
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets  
The Company performs annual impairment tests on goo dwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives i n the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when e vents occur 
or circumstances change that would, more likely tha n not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or  an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying 
value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include signific ant changes in business climate, operating results,  planned 
investments in the reporting unit, planned divestit ures or an expectation that the carrying amount may  not be recoverable, among other factors. The Compa ny may 
first assess qualitative factors to determine wheth er it is more likely than not that the fair value o f a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount . If, after assessing 
the totality of events and circumstances, the Compa ny determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater tha n its carrying 
amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary . The two- step impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the 
carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair  value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is pote ntially impaired and the Company proceeds to step t wo of the 
impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, t he Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the re porting 
unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any .  
The Company generally bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysi s of the present value of future discounted cash fl ows and 
the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporti ng unit based on the present value of the cash flow s that the 
Company expects the reporting unit to generate in t he future. The Company's significant estimates in t he discounted cash flows model include: its weighte d average 
cost of capital; long- term rate of growth and profitability of the report ing unit's business; and working capital effects. T he market valuation approach indicates the fair 
value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded compan ies in similar lines of business. Significant estim ates in the 
market valuation approach model include identifying  similar companies with comparable business factors  such as size, growth, profitability, risk and retu rn on 
investment and assessing comparable revenue and ope rating income multiples in estimating the fair valu e of the reporting unit.  
Indefinite- lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquir ed trade names and trademarks. The Company may firs t perform a qualitative assessment to determine 
whether it is more likely than not that an indefini te -lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after asse ssing the totality of events and circumstances, the  C ompany 
determines that it is more likely than not that the  indefinite- lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantita tive fair value measurement is necessary. If a 
quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the Company u tilizes the relief-from- royalty method. This method assumes 
that trade names and trademarks have value to the e xtent that their owner is relieved of the obligatio n to pay royalties for the benefits received from t hem. This 
method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate roy alty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.

Operating Leases  
The Company leases retail store space, certain dist ribution and warehouse facilities, office space and  other non- real estate assets under operating leases. 
Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalat ion clauses, rent holidays or certain landlord ince ntives, including tenant improvement allowances. Re nt 
expense for non-cancelable operating leases with sc heduled rent increases or landlord incentives are r ecognized on a straight- line basis over the lease term, 
beginning with the effective lease commencement dat e, which is generally the date in which the Company  takes possession of or controls the physical use o f the 
property. Certain leases also provide for contingen t rents, which are determined as a percent of sales  in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent l iability is 
recognized together with the corresponding rent exp ense when specified levels have been achieved or wh en the Company determines that achieving the specif ied 
levels during the period is probable.  
Fair Value Measurements  
The Company measures certain financial assets and l iabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, incl uding derivatives and available-for- sale securities. Fair value is 
the price the Company would receive to sell an asse t or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly tran saction with a market participant at the measuremen t date. The 
Company uses a three- level hierarchy established by the Financial Accoun ting Standards Board ("FASB") that prioritizes fair  value measurements based on the 
types of inputs used for the various valuation tech niques (market approach, income approach and cost a pproach).  
The levels of hierarchy are described below:  
The Company’ s assessment of the significance of a particular in put to the fair value measurement in its entirety r equires judgment and considers factors specific to 
the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabil ities are classified in their entirety based on the  most conservative level of input that is significa nt to the fair value 
measurement.  
Pricing vendors are utilized for certain Level 1 an d Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide  a quoted market price in an active market or use o bservable 
inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quo tes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly 
quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Th e fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily ma rket foreign 
currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency vo latilities, currency correlations and interest rate s and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of 
its counterparties.  
The Company’s fair value processes include controls  that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include a compa rison of fair 
values to another independent pricing vendor.  
Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for addit ional information.  
Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency T ransactions  
Adjustments resulting from translating foreign func tional currency financial statements into U.S. Doll ars are included in the foreign currency translatio n adjustment, a 
component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders’ equity .  
The Company’ s global subsidiaries have various assets and liabi lities, primarily receivables and payables, which a re denominated in currencies other than their 
functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is r ecorded in Other (income) expense, net , within the 
Consolidated Statements of Income.  
Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities  
The Company uses derivative financial instruments t o reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currenc y exchange rates and interest rates. All derivative s are 
recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated 
other comprehensive income (a component of Total shareholders’ equity ), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure,  
whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the h edge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at 
settlement from derivatives in the same category as  the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges , this 
is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Fl ows. For designated net investment hedges, this is within 
the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flo ws. For the Company’ s fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps 
used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fi xed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates , the related cash flows from periodic interest pay ments are 
reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Fl ows. Refer to Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives 
for more information on the Company’s risk manageme nt program and derivatives.  
Stock-Based Compensation  
The Company estimates the fair value of options and  stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1990 Plan”) and 
employees’ purchase rights under the Employee Stock  Purchase Plans (“ESPPs”) using the Black- Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognize s this fair 
value, net of estimated forfeitures, as Operating overhead expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the v esting period using the straight- line method. 
Refer to Note 11 — Common Stock and Stock-Based Com pensation for more information on the Company’s sto ck programs.  
 
56  •  Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identi cal assets or liabilities. 
•  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are o bservable for the asset or liability, either direct ly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for s imilar 
assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabiliti es in markets that are not active.  
•  Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is lit tle or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

Income Taxes  
The Company accounts for income taxes using the ass et and liability method. This approach requires the  recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  for the 
expected future tax consequences of temporary diffe rences between the carrying amounts and the tax bas is of assets and liabilities. The Company records a  
valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets t o the amount management believes is more likely tha n not to be realized. United States income taxes ar e 
provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriat ed. The Company determines annually the amount of 
undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinit ely in its non-U.S. operations.  
The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain  tax positions in the financial statements only whe n it is more likely than not that the position will  be sustained 
upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The C ompany recognizes interest and penalties related to  income tax matters in Income tax expense .  
Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes for further discussi on.  
Earnings Per Share  
Basic earnings per common share is calculated by di viding Net income by the weighted average number of common shares out standing during the year. Diluted 
earnings per common share is calculated by adjustin g weighted average outstanding shares, assuming con version of all potentially dilutive stock options a nd 
awards.  
Refer to Note 12 — Earnings Per Share for further d iscussion.  
Management Estimates  
The preparation of financial statements in conformi ty with generally accepted accounting principles re quires management to make estimates, including esti mates 
relating to assumptions that affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of c ontingent assets and liabilities at the date of fin ancial statements 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses d uring the reporting period. Actual results could di ffer from these estimates.  
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  
In July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standar ds update intended to provide guidance on the prese ntation of unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting th e manner 
in which an entity would settle, at the reporting d ate, any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net op erating loss 
carryforwards, similar tax losses or tax credit car ryforwards exist. This accounting standard was effe ctive for the Company beginning June 1, 2014 and ea rly 
adoption was permitted. Management early adopted th is guidance and the adoption did not have a materia l impact on the Company's consolidated financial po sition 
or results of operations.  
In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standar ds update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite- lived intangible assets other than goodwill for 
impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine wheth er further impairment testing is necessary. This ac counting 
standards update was effective for the Company begi nning June 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard d id not have a material impact on the Company's 
consolidated financial position or results of opera tions.  
In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancin g disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of  an entity’ s right to offset and related arrangements 
associated with its financial instruments and deriv ative instruments. This new guidance requires compa nies to disclose both gross and net information abo ut 
instruments and transactions eligible for offset in  the statement of financial position and instrument s and transactions subject to master netting arrang ements. This 
new guidance was effective for the Company beginnin g June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expa nded disclosures, the adoption had no impact on the  
Company's consolidated financial position or result s of operations.  
Recently Issued Accounting Standards  
In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard s update that replaces existing revenue recognition  guidance. The updated guidance requires companies to 
recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfe r of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the  entity 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires  that reporting companies disclose the nature, amou nt, timing 
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising f rom contracts with customers. Based on the FASB's d ecision in July 2015 to defer the effective date an d to allow 
more flexibility with implementation, the Company a nticipates the new standard will be effective for t he Company beginning June 1, 2018. The new standard  is 
required to be applied retrospectively to each prio r reporting period presented or retrospectively wit h the cumulative effect of initially applying it re cognized at the 
date of initial application. The Company has not ye t selected a transition method and is currently eva luating the effect the guidance will have on the Co nsolidated 
Financial Statements.

The Company elects to record the gross assets and l iabilities of its derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’ s derivative 
financial instruments are subject to master netting  arrangements that allow for the offset of assets a nd liabilities in the event of default or early ter mination of the 
contract. Any amounts of cash collateral received r elated to these instruments associated with the Com pany's credit- related contingent features are recorded in 
Cash and equivalents and Accrued liabilities , the latter of which would further offset against the Company’s derivative asset balance (refer to  N ote 17 — Risk 
Management and Derivatives ). Cash collateral recei ved related to the Company's credit related conting ent features is presented in the Cash provided by operations 
component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flo ws. Any amounts of non- cash collateral received, such as securities, are n ot recorded on the Consolidated

On November 1, 2011, the Company entered into a com mitted credit facility agreement with a syndicate o f banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings 
with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. Following an extension agreem ent on September 17, 2013 between the Company and t he 
syndicate of banks, the facility matures November 1 , 2017. Based on the Company’s current long-term se nior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard 
and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’ s Investor Services, respectively, the interest rat e charged on any outstanding borrowings would be th e prevailing LIBOR plus 
0.445% . The facility fee is 0.055% of the total commitment. Under this committed credi t facility, the Company must maintain, among other things, certain minimum 
specified financial ratios with which the Company w as in compliance at May 31, 2015 . No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of May 31, 2015 or 2014 .

(1)  The Company has entered into interest rate swap agr eements whereby the Company receives fixed interest  payments at the same rate as the note and pays 
variable interest payments based on the six - month LIBOR plus a spread. The swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the correspond ing 
note. At May 31, 2015 , the interest rates payable on these swap agreements ranged from approximately 0.3% to 0.5% .  
(2)  The Company assumed a total of $59 million in bonds  payable as part of its agreement to purchase certa in Corporate properties; this was treated as a non-
cash financing transaction. The property serves as collateral for the debt. The purchase of these prop erties was accounted for as a business combination 
where the total consideration of $85 million was allocated to the land and buildings acquired; n o other tangible or intangible assets or liabilitie s resulted from the 
purchase. The bonds mature in 2017 and 2018 and the  Company does not have the ability to re -negotiate the terms of the debt agreements and woul d incur 
significant financial penalties if the notes were p aid-off prior to maturity.  
(3)  NIKE Logistics YK assumed a total of ¥13.0 billion in loans as part of its agreement to purchase a dis tribution center in Japan, which serves as collater al for the

The provision for income taxes is as follows:  
A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal in come tax rate to the effective income tax rate is a s follows:  
The effective tax rate from continuing operations f or the year ended May 31, 2015 was 180 basis points lower than the effective tax rate from  continuing operations 
for the year ended May 31, 2014 primarily due to th e favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdi ctions.   
The effective tax rate from continuing operations f or the year ended May 31, 2014 was 70 basis points lower than the effective tax rate from  continuing operations 
for the year ended May 31, 2013 primarily due to an  increase in the amount of earnings from lower tax rate jurisdictions.  
During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 , the Company reached a resolution with the IRS on a U.S. Unilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement 
that covers intercompany transfer pricing for fisca l years 2011 through 2020. This agreement resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate due to a r eduction in the 
Company’s permanently reinvested  foreign   earnings, which was partially offset by a reduction  in previously unrecognized tax benefits. It also r esulted in a  
decrease  in the   effective tax rate due to the re cognition of a deferred tax charge. The net result of the agreement did not have a material impact on the Company’ s 
effective income tax rate in fiscal 2014.

The following is a reconciliation of the changes in  the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits:  
As of May 31, 2015 , total gross unrecognized tax benefit s, excluding related interest and penalties, were $ 438 million , $260 million of which would affect the 
Company's effective tax rate if recognized in futur e periods.  
The Company recognizes interest and penalties relat ed to income tax matters in Income tax expense . The liability for payment of interest and penalti es decreased 
$3 million during the year ended May 31, 2015 , and  increased $55 million and $4 million during the ye ars ended May 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. As of 
May 31, 2015 and 2014 , accrued interest and penalt ies related to uncertain tax positions were $164 mi llion and $167 million , respectively (excluding federal 
benefit).  
The Company incurs tax liabilities primarily in the  United States, China and the Netherlands, as well as various state and other foreign jurisdictions. T he Company is 
currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2012 through 2014 tax years. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters 
through fiscal 2011, with the exception of the vali dation of foreign tax credits utilized. As previous ly disclosed, the Company received a statutory noti ce of deficiency 
for fiscal 2011 proposing an increase in tax of $31  million , subject to interest, related to the foreign tax c redit matter. This notice also reported a decrease in foreign 
tax credit carryovers for fiscal 2010 and 2011. The  Company has contested this deficiency notice by fi ling a petition with the U.S Tax Court in April 201 5. The 
Company does not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material impact on the financial statemen ts. No payments on the assessment would be required  until 
the dispute is definitively resolved. Based on the information currently available, the Company does n ot anticipate a significant increase or decrease to  its 
unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within th e next 12 months.  
The Company’ s major foreign jurisdictions, China, the Netherlan ds and Brazil, have concluded substantially all inc ome tax matters through calendar 2005, fiscal 
2009 and calendar 2008, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit is sues in the      As of May 31,

The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the u ndistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unles s they are considered indefinitely reinvested outsi de the 
United States. At May 31, 2015 , the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign s ubsidiaries upon which United States income taxes h ave not been provided were 
approximately $8.3 billion . If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or if the shares of the relev ant foreign subsidiaries were sold or 
otherwise transferred, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liabi lity associated with the foreign dividend or the ot herwise taxable 
transaction. Assuming a full utilization of the for eign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax li ability associated with these temporary differences  of undistributed 
earnings would be approximately $2.7 billion at May  31, 2015 .  
A portion of the Company's foreign operations are b enefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expir e in 2021 . This tax holiday may be extended when certain 
conditions are met or may be terminated early if ce rtain conditions are not met. The impact of this ta x holiday decreased foreign taxes by $174 million ,  $138 million 
and $108 million for the fiscal years ended May 31,  2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on d iluted earnings per common share was 
$0.20 , $0.15 and $0.12 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.  
Deferred tax assets at May 31, 2015 and 2014 were reduced by a valuation allowance relating to t ax benefits of certain subsidiaries with operating losses. There 
was no net change in the valuation allowance for the ye ar ended May 31, 2015 compared to a net increase of  $4 million and a net decrease of $22 million for the 
years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.  
The Company has available domestic and foreign loss  carry-forwards of $36 million at May 31, 2015 . Su ch losses will expire as follows:    
During the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013  , income tax benefits attributable to employee sto ck-based compensation transactions of $224 million , $135 
million and $76 million , respectively, were alloca ted to Total shareholders’ equity .  
Sojitz America is the sole owner of the Company’s a uthorized redeemable preferred stock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Soj itz America or the 
Company at par value aggregating $0.3 million . A c umulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no divi dends may be declared or paid 
on the common stock of the Company unless dividends  on the redeemable preferred stock have been declar ed and paid in full. There have been no changes in the 
redeemable preferred stock in the three years ended  May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . As the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, Sojitz America does not have 
general voting rights, but does have the right to v ote as a separate class on the sale of all or subst antially all of the assets of the Company and its s ubsidiaries, on 
merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution o f the Company or on the sale or assignment of the N IKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the Uni ted States. 
The redeemable preferred stock has been fully issue d to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferre d stock. The Company's articles of incorporation do  not 
permit the issuance of additional preferred stock.  
The authorized number of shares of Class A Common S tock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no pa r value, are 200 million and 1,200 million , 
respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is  convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock . Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited i n 
certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the divid end and liquidation preferences or participation ri ghts of the 
Class A and Class B common shareholders.  
In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the sh areholders approved, the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Ince ntive Plan (the “1990 Plan”). The 1990 Plan, as amended, 
provides for the issuance of up to 326 million prev iously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in c onnection with stock options and other awards granted 
under the plan. The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, s tock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restric ted stock 
units and performance- based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying 
shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Boa rd of Directors administers the 1990 Plan. The comm ittee has the authority to determine the employees to whom 
awards will be made, the amount of the awards and t he other terms and conditions of the awards. Substa ntially all stock option grants outstanding under t he 1990 
Plan were granted in the first quarter of each fisc al year, vest ratably over four years and expire 10  years from the date of grant.  
The following table summarizes the Company’s total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Operating overhead expense :    
As of May 31, 2015 , the Company had $180 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock optio ns, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized in 
Operating overhead expense over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.

The weighted average fair value per share of the op tions granted during the years ended May 31, 2015 ,  2014 and 2013 , as computed using the Black- Scholes 
pricing model, was $16.95 , $14.89 and $12.71 , res pectively. The weighted average assumptions used to  estimate these fair values are as follows:  
The Company estimates the expected volatility based  on the implied volatility in market traded options  on the Company’ s common stock with a term greater than 
one year, along with other factors. The weighted averag e expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns . The 
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (consta nt maturity) risk- free rate in effect at the date of grant for period s corresponding with the expected term of the 
options.  
The following summarizes the stock option transacti ons under the plan discussed above:    
The weighted average contractual life remaining for  options outstanding and options exercisable at May  31, 2015 was 6.0 years and 4.7 years, respectively. The 
aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding a nd exercisable at May 31, 2015 was $3,178 million a nd $2,235 million , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value 
was the amount by which the market value of the und erlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the op tions. The total intrinsic value of the options exe rcised 
during the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013  was $795 million , $474 million and $293 million ,  respectively.  
In addition to the 1990 Plan, the Company gives emp loyees the right to purchase shares at a discount t o the market price under employee stock purchase pl ans 
(“ESPPs”). Employees are eligible to participate th rough payroll deductions of up to 10% of their comp ensation. At the end of each six - month offering period, shares 
are purchased by the participants at 85% of the low er of the fair market value at the beginning or the  end of the offering period. Employees purchased 1. 4 million , 
1.4 million and 1.6 million shares during each of t he three years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 ,  respectively.  
From time to time, the Company grants restricted st ock and restricted stock units to key employees und er the 1990 Plan. The number of shares underlying s uch 
awards granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were 0.3 million , 0.3  million and 1.6 million , respectively, with weighted 
average values per share of $79.38 , $63.89 and $46 .86 , respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respec tive 
shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipi ents of restricted stock units are entitled to divi dend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The val ue of all 
grants of restricted stock and restricted stock uni ts was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2015 , 201 4 and 2013 , 
the aggregate fair value of restricted stock and re stricted stock units vested was $20 million , $28 m illion and $25 million , respectively, determined as of the date of 
vesting. As of May 31, 2015, the Company had $48 mi llion of unrecognized compensation costs from restr icted stock units to be recognized in Operating overhead 
expense over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.

The following is a reconciliation from Basic earnin gs per common share to Diluted earnings per common share. The computation of Diluted earnings per comm on 
share omitted options to purchase an additional 0.1  million , 0.1 million and 0.1 million shares of co mmon stock outstanding for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 
and 2013 , respectively, because the options were a nti-dilutive.  
The Company has a qualified 401(k) Savings and Prof it Sharing Plan to which all U.S. employees who wor k at least 1,000 hours in a year are able to partic ipate. 
The Company matches a portion of employee contribut ions. Company contributions to the savings plan wer e $58 million , $51 million and $46 million for the years 
ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and are included in Operating overhead expense . The terms of the plan also allow for annual discr etionary 
profit sharing contributions to the accounts of eli gible employees by the Company as determined by the  Board of Directors. Contributions of $58 million ,  $49 million 
and $47 million were made to the plan and are inclu ded in Operating overhead expense for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.  
The Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (“L TIP”) that was adopted by the Board of Directors and appr oved by shareholders in September 1997 and later 
amended in fiscal 2007. The Company recognized $68 million , $46 million and $50 million of Operating overhead expense related to cash awards under the LTIP 
during the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013  , respectively.  
The Company allows certain highly compensated emplo yees and non- employee directors of the Company to defer compensa tion under a nonqualified deferred 
compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan liabi lities were $443 million and $390 million at May 31 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and primarily classified as 
long-term in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities .  
The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandat ed. 
The liability related to the unfunded pension liabi lities of the plans was $98 million and $100 millio n at May 31, 2015 and May 31, 2014 , respectively, which was 
primarily classified as long-term in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities .

During the year ended May 31, 2013 , the Company divested of Umbro and Cole Haan, allo wing it to focus its resources on driving growth in  the NIKE, Jordan, 
Converse and Hurley brands.  
On February 1, 2013, the Company completed the sale  of Cole Haan to Apax Partners for an agreed upon p urchase price of $570 million and received at closing 
$561 million , net of $9 million of purchase price adjustments. The transaction resulted in a gain on sale of $231 million , net of $137 million in Income tax expense ; 
this gain is included in the Net income from discontinued operations line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  There were no adjustments to these 
recorded amounts as of May 31, 2015 . Beginning Nov ember 30, 2012, the Company classified the Cole Haa n disposal group as held-for- sale and presented the 
results of Cole Haan's operations in the Net income from discontinued operations line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  From this date until the sale, 
the assets and liabilities of Cole Haan were record ed in the Assets of discontinued operations and Liabilities of discontinued operations line items on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. Previous ly, these amounts were reported in the Company's op erating segment presentation as “Other Businesses.”   
Under the sale agreement, the Company agreed to pro vide certain transition services to Cole Haan for a n expected period of 3 to 9 months from the date of sale. 
These services were essentially complete as of May 31, 2013 and the Company has had no significant inv olvement with Cole Haan beyond the transition servi ces. 
The Company has also licensed NIKE proprietary Air and Lunar technologies to Cole Haan for a transitio n period. The continuing cash flows related to thes e items 
are not significant to Cole Haan. Additionally, pre existing guarantees of certain Cole Haan lease paym ents remained in place after the sale; the maximum exposure 
under the guarantees is $ 23 million at May 31, 201 5 . The fair value of the guarantees is not materia l.

On November 30, 2012, the Company completed the sal e of certain assets of Umbro to Iconix Brand Group (“Iconix”) for $ 225 million . The Umbro disposal group 
was classified as held -for-sale as of November 30, 2012 and the results o f Umbro's operations are presented in the Net income from discontinued operations line 
item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The liabilities of Umbro were recorded in the Liabilities of discontinued operations line items on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. Previously, these amounts were repo rted in the Company's operating segment presentatio n as “Other Businesses.” Upon meeting the held-for- sale 
criteria, the Company recorded a loss of $ 107 mill ion , net of tax, on the sale of Umbro and the loss  is included in the Net income from discontinued operations line 
item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The loss on sale was calculated as the net sales price less Umbro assets of $ 248 million , including intangibles, 
goodwill and fixed assets, other miscellaneous char ges of $ 22 million and the release of the associat ed cumulative translation adjustment of $ 129 milli on . The tax 
benefit on the loss was $ 67 million . There were n o adjustments to these recorded amounts as of May 3 1, 2015 .  
Summarized results of the Company's discontinued op erations are as follows:  
There were no assets or liabilities of discontinued  operations as of May 31, 2015 and May 31, 2014 .  
The Company leases space for certain of its offices , warehouses and retail stores under leases expirin g from 1 to 19 years after May 31, 2015 . Rent expense was 
$594 million , $533 million and $482 million for th e years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Amounts of minimum future annual co mmitments 
under non-cancelable operating and capital leases a re as follows (in millions):  
As of May 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $165 million and $135 m illion , respectively. These letters of credit were 
generally issued for the purchase of inventory and guarantees of the Company’s performance under certa in self-insurance and other programs.  
In connection with various contracts and agreements , the Company provides routine indemnification rela ting to the enforceability of intellectual property  rights, 
coverage for legal issues that arise and other item s where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Cur rently, the Company has several such agreements in place. 
However, based on the Company’ s historical experience and the estimated probabili ty of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such 
indemnification is not material to the Company’s fi nancial position or results of operations.  
In the ordinary course of its business, the Company  is involved in various legal proceedings involving  contractual and employment relationships, product liability 
claims, trademark rights and a variety of other mat ters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Co mpany 
does not believe any currently identified claim, pr oceeding or litigation, either individually or in a ggregate, will have a material impact on the Compan y’s results of 
operations, financial position or cash flows.  
The Company is exposed to global market risks, incl uding the effect of changes in foreign currency exc hange rates and interest rates, and uses derivative s to 
manage financial exposures that occur in the normal  course of business. The Company does not hold or i ssue derivatives for trading or speculative purpose s.  
The Company may elect to designate certain derivati ves as hedging instruments under the accounting sta ndards for derivatives and hedging. The Company for mally 
documents all relationships between designated hedg ing instruments and hedged items as well as its ris k management objectives and strategies for undertak ing 
hedge transactions. This process includes linking a ll derivatives designated as hedges to either recog nized assets or liabilities or forecasted transacti ons.  
The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 3 1, 2015 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro 
and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs . All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based o n the 
instrument’s maturity date.

Cash Flow Hedges  
The purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive a nd negative effects of currency fluctuations on the  
Company's consolidated results of operations, finan cial position and cash flows. Foreign currency expo sures that the Company may elect to hedge in this m anner 
include product cost exposures, non- functional currency denominated external and interc ompany revenues, selling and administrative expense s, investments in 
U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt sec urities and certain other intercompany transactions .  
Product cost exposures are primarily generated thro ugh non-functional currency denominated product purchases a nd the foreign currency adjustment program 
described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase p roducts in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities , including those supporting the Company's North Am erica, 
Greater China, Japan and European geographies, purc hase product from the NIKE Trading Company (“NTC”),  a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE 
branded products from third party factories, predom inantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product s to NIKE 
entities in their respective functional currencies.  When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a differe nt functional currency, the result is a foreign cur rency exposure for 
the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product d irectly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars.  These purchases generate a foreign currency exposu re for 
those NIKE entities with a functional currency othe r than the U.S. Dollar.  
The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is desi gned to more effectively manage foreign currency ri sk by 
assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natur al offsets to the Company's existing foreign curren cy exposures. Under this 
program, the Company’s payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of  currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the 
labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the  factories in the production of NIKE branded produc ts (“factory input costs”) are denominated. For the portion of 
the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to p lace formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies 
within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and t he local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the fa ctory ’s 
acceptance of NIKE’ s purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are  separated from the related purchase order, and the ir accounting treatment is described 
further below.  
The Company’ s policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where interna l netting or other strategies cannot be effectively  
employed. Typically the Company may enter into hedg e contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and  may place 
incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by th e time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign cu rrency derivatives 
designated as cash flow hedges was  $14.4 billion  as of May 31, 2015 .  
During the year ended May 31, 2015 , the Company en tered into a series of forward-starting interest ra te swap agreements with a total notional amount of $1 
billion . These instruments were designated as cash flow he dges of the variability in the expected cash outflo ws of interest payments on future debt due to chang es 
in benchmark interest rates.  
All changes in fair value of derivatives designated  as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective por tion, are recorded in  Other comprehensive income  until  Net 
income  is affected by the variability of cash flows of th e hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts record ed in  Other comprehensive income  will be released to  
Net income  in periods following the maturity of the related d erivative, rather than at maturity. Effective hedge  results are classified within the Consolidated 
Statements of Income in the same manner as the unde rlying exposure, with the results of hedges of non- functional currency denominated revenues and produc t 
cost exposures, excluding embedded derivatives as d escribed below, recorded in Revenues or Cost of sales , when the underlying hedged transaction affects 
consolidated Net income . Results of hedges of selling and administrative e xpense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. 
Amounts recorded in  Other comprehensive income  related to forward-starting interest rate swaps wil l be released through  Interest expense (income), net  over the 
term of the issued debt. Results of hedges of antic ipated purchases and sales of U.S. Dollar-denominat ed available-for-sale securities are recorded in Other 
(income) expense, net when the securities are sold. Results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are r ecorded in  Other (income) expense, 
net when the transaction occurs. The Company classifies  the cash flows at settlement from these designated  cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category a s 
the cash flows from the related hedged items, prima rily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Fl ows.  
Premiums paid on options are initially recorded as deferred charges. The Company assesses the effectiv eness of options based on the total cash flows meth od and 
records total changes in the options’ fair value to  Other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective.  
The Company formally assesses, both at a hedge’ s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the de rivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been 
highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives  may be expected to remain highly effective in futu re periods. 
Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed base d on changes in forward rates . Ineffectiveness was  immaterial for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014  and 
2013 .

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospecti vely when: (1) it determines that the derivative is  no longer highly effective in offsetting changes i n the cash 
flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such  as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); ( 2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or  exercised; 
(3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted tr ansaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instru ment is no 
longer appropriate.  
When the Company discontinues hedge accounting beca use it is no longer probable that the forecasted tr ansaction will occur in the originally expected per iod, but is 
expected to occur within an additional two-month pe riod of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the de rivative remains in Accumulated other comprehensive income 
and is reclassified to Net income when the forecasted transaction affects consolidate d Net income . However, if it is probable that a forecasted tran saction will not 
occur by the end of the originally specified time p eriod or within an additional two- month period of time thereafter, the gains and loss es that were accumulated in 
Other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net . In all situations in which hedge accounting is di scontinued and the 
derivative remains outstanding, the Company will ca rry the derivative at its fair value on the Consoli dated Balance Sheets, recognizing future changes in  the fair 
value in Other (income) expense, net . For the years ended May 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the amounts recorded in Other (income) expense, net as a result of the 
discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the for ecasted transaction was no longer probable of occur ring were immaterial .  
As of May 31, 2015 , $685 million of deferred net gains ( net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivat ives accumulated in Other comprehensive income are 
expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the under lying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income . Actual 
amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding  mature. As of 
May 31, 2015 , the maximum term over which the Comp any is hedging exposures to the variability of cash  flows for its forecasted transactions was 36 month s.  
Fair Value Hedges  
The Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed- rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates . Derivatives currently used by 
the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, p ay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the relate d long-term 
debt meet the shortcut method requirements under th e accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.  Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the int erest rate 
swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in t he fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The  cash flows associated with the Company’ s fair value hedges 
are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows.  The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps design ated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 
2015 , 2014 or 2013 . As of May 31, 2015 , interest  rate swaps designated as fair value hedges had a t otal notional amount of  $100 million .  
Net Investment Hedges  
The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in th e future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign- currency-denominated net investments in wholly- owned 
international operations. All changes in fair value  of the derivatives designated as net investment he dges, except ineffective portions, are reported as a component 
of Other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustm ents on those investments. The Company classifies t he cash flows at settlement 
of its net investment hedges within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flo ws. The Company assesses hedge 
effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. Th e Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2015 , 
2014 or 2013 . The Company had no outstanding net i nvestment hedges as of May 31, 2015 .  
Undesignated Derivative Instruments  
The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchang e forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance shee t and/or the 
embedded derivative contracts explained below. Thes e forwards are not designated as hedging instrument s under the accounting standards for derivatives an d 
hedging. Accordingly, these undesignated instrument s are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets wit h their 
corresponding change in fair value recognized in  Other (income) expense, net , together with the re- measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sh eet 
position or embedded derivative contract. The Compa ny classifies the cash flows at settlement from und esignated instruments within the Cash provided by 
operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Fl ows. The total notional amount of outstanding undes ignated derivative instruments was  $4.4 
billion  as of  May 31, 2015 .  
Embedded Derivatives  
As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is  created upon the factory ’s acceptance of NIKE’ s purchase 
order for currencies within the factory currency ex posure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor  the local or functional currency of the factory. E mbedded 
derivative contracts are treated as foreign currenc y forward contracts that are bifurcated from the re lated purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative 
asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Shee ts with their corresponding change in fair value re cognized in  Other (income) expense, net , from the date a 
purchase order is accepted by a factory through the  date the purchase price is no longer subject to fo reign currency fluctuations.  
In addition, the Company has entered into certain o ther contractual agreements which have payments tha t are indexed to currencies that are not the functi onal 
currency of either substantial party to the contrac ts. These payment terms expose NIKE to variability in foreign exchange rates and create embedded deriv ative 
contracts that must be bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets or liabilities on the Consolidate d Balance Sheets with their 
corresponding changes in fair value recognized in  Other (income) expense, net until each payment is settled.  
At May 31, 2015 , the notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $205 mill ion .  
Credit Risk  
The Company is exposed to credit- related losses in the event of nonperformance by co unterparties to hedging instruments. The counterpar ties to all derivative 
transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does  not eliminate the Company’s  
 
70  
Table of Contents  
 
exposure to credit risk with these institutions. Th is credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains i n such contracts should any of these counterparties  fail to perform as 
contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has es tablished strict counterparty credit guidelines tha t are continually monitored.  
The Company’s derivative contracts contain credit r isk related contingent features designed to protect  against significant deterioration in counterpartie s’
creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to sett le outstanding derivative contracts in the normal c ourse of business. The Company’ s bilateral credit related 
contingent features generally require the owing ent ity, either the Company or the derivative counterpa rty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair  value in excess 
of $50 million should the fair value of outstanding  derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 m illion . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of 
either the Company or the counterparty could also t rigger collateral requirements. As of  May 31, 2015  , the Company was in compliance with all credit ris k related 
contingent features and had derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a n et liability position of $4 million . Accordingly, the Company was 
not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of  May 31, 2015 , the Company had received  $968 million  of cash collateral 
and  $74 million  of securities from various counte rparties to its derivative contracts (refer to  Not e 6 — Fair Value Measurements ). Given the considerations 
described above, the Company considers the impact o f the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial  .  
The Company’ s operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Br and segments are defined by geographic 
regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.  
Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predomi nantly in one industry: the design, development, ma rketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel a nd 
equipment. The Company’ s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Easte rn Europe, Greater China, 
Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for  the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company’ s NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are 
managed within each geographic operating segment. C onverse is also a reportable segment for NIKE, Inc. , and operates in one industry: the design, marketi ng, 
licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel a nd accessories.  
Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the w ay management views the Company. Global Brand Divis ions 
primarily represent NIKE Brand licensing businesses  that are not part of a geographic operating segmen t, and demand creation, operating overhead and prod uct 
creation and design expenses that are centrally man aged for the NIKE Brand.  
Corporate consists largely of unallocated general a nd administrative expenses, including expenses asso ciated with centrally managed departments; deprecia tion 
and amortization related to the Company’s headquart ers; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensatio n programs, including stock- based compensation; and 
certain foreign currency gains and losses, includin g certain hedge gains and losses.  
The primary financial measure used by the Company t o evaluate performance of individual operating segm ents is earnings before interest and taxes (commonl y 
referred to as “EBIT”), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Reconciling items for EBIT represent corporate expe nse items that are not allocated to the operating s egments for management reporting.  
As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE 
Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set appro ximately nine months in advance of the future selli ng 
season based on average market spot rates in the ca lendar month preceding the date they are establishe d. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating 
segments and Converse reflect use of these standard  rates to record non-functional currency product pu rchases in the entity’ s functional currency. Differences 
between assigned standard foreign currency rates an d actual market rates are included in Corporate, to gether with foreign currency hedge gains and losses  
generated from the Company's centrally managed fore ign exchange risk management program and other conv ersion gains and losses.  
Accounts receivable, net , Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by ma nagement and are therefore 
provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as p resented in the following table represent capital e xpenditures.  
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified t o conform to fiscal 2015 presentation.

this Option grant, the Optionee agrees to all of th e terms and conditions of the Option grant. The ter ms and conditions of 
the Option grant set forth in the attached Exhibit A and in the attached Appendix For Non- U.S. Optionees are 
incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement . Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement but 
defined in the Plan shall have the same definitions  as in the Plan.  
1.      Grant Date; Expiration Date. The Grant Date for this Option is _________. The Op tion shall continue in 
effect until ________ (the “Expiration Date”) unless earlier terminated as provided in Sections 1  or 6 of Exhibit A. The 
Option shall not be exercisable on or after the Exp iration Date.  
2.      Vesting of Option. The Vesting Reference Date of this Option is ______ _______. Until it expires or is

NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT  
1.      Termination of Employment or Service.  
1.1      General Rule. Except as provided in this Section 1 or in Section 6.2, the Option may not be 
exercised unless at the time of exercise the Option ee is employed by or in the service of the Company and shall have 
been so employed or provided such service continuou sly since the Grant Date. For purposes  
 
 

 
 
of this Agreement, the Optionee is considered to be  employed by or in the service of the Company if th e Optionee is 
employed by or in the service of the Company or any  parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company (a n “Employer” ). 
1.2      Termination Generally. If the Optionee’ s employment or service with the Company terminates  
for any reason other than total disability, death, normal retirement or early retirement as provided i n Sections 1.3, 1.4, 
1.5 or 1.6, or cause or good reason in connection w ith a change in control as provided in Section 6.2,  the Option may be 
exercised at any time before the Expiration Date or  the expiration of three months after the date of t ermination, 
whichever is the shorter period, but only if and to  the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise t he Option at the date 
of termination.  
1.3      Termination Because of Total Disability. If the Optionee’ s employment or service with the 
Company terminates because of total disability, the  Option shall, following the receipt and processing  by the Company’ s 
legal department of any necessary and appropriate d ocumentation in connection with the Optionee’ s termination (the 
“Processing Period”), become exercisable in full and may be exercised at any time before the Expiration Date or before 
the date that is four years after the date of termi nation, whichever is the shorter period. The term “ total disability” means 
a medically determinable mental or physical impairm ent that is expected to result in death or has last ed or is expected to

will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of domicile at the time of dea th.  
1.5      Termination Because of Normal Retirement. Subject to Section 6.2, if the Optionee’ s 
employment or service with the Company terminates b ecause of the Optionee’ s normal retirement before the first 
anniversary of the Vesting Reference Date, the Opti on shall immediately terminate. If the Optionee’ s employment or 
service with the Company terminates because of the Optionee’ s normal retirement on or after the first anniversa ry of the 
Vesting Reference Date, the Option shall, following  the Processing Period, become exercisable in full and may be 
exercised at any time before the Expiration Date or  before the expiration of four years after the date  of termination, 
whichever is the shorter period. For purposes of th is Section 1.5, the term “normal retirement” means a termination of 
employment or service other than as a result of dea th or total disability that occurs at a time when ( a) the Optionee’ s age 
is at least 60 years, and (b) the Optionee has been  employed by or in the service of the Company or a parent or 
subsidiary corporation of the Company for at least five full years.  
1.6      Termination Because of Early Retirement . Subject to Section 6.2, if the Optionee’ s 
employment or service with the Company terminates b ecause of the Optionee’ s early retirement before the first 
anniversary of the Vesting Reference Date, the Opti on shall immediately terminate. If the Optionee’ s employment or 
service with the Company terminates because of the Optionee’ s early retirement on or after the first anniversar y of the 
Vesting Reference Date, the Option shall continue t o become exercisable according to the schedule spec ified in this 
Agreement with no forfeiture of any portion of the Option resulting from such termination, and the Opt ion may be

Optionee has been employed by or in the service of the Company or a parent or subsidiary corporation o f the Company 
for at least five full years.  
1.7      Absence on Leave. Absence on leave or on account of illness or disabi lity under rules established 
by the committee of the Board of Directors of the C ompany appointed to administer the Plan (the “Commi ttee”) shall 
not be deemed an interruption of employment or serv ice.  
1.8      Failure to Exercise Option. To the extent that following termination of employm ent or service, 
the Option is not exercised within the applicable p eriods described above or in Section 6.2, all furth er rights to purchase 
shares pursuant to the Option shall cease and termi nate.  
2.      Method of Exercise of Option. The Option may be exercised only by notice in writi ng from the Optionee 
to the Company , or a broker designated by the Company, of the Optionee’ s binding commitment to purchase shares, 
specifying the number of shares the Optionee desire s to purchase under the Option and the date on whic h the Optionee 
agrees to complete the transaction and, if required  to comply with the Securities Act of 1933, contain ing a representation 
that it is the Optionee’s intention to acquire the shares for investment and not with a view to distri bution (the “Exercise 
Notice ”) . On or before the date specified for completion of t he purchase, the Optionee must pay the Company the full 
purchase price of those shares by either of, or a combination of, the following metho ds at the election of the Optionee: 
(a) cash payment by wire transfer; or (b) delivery of an Exercise Notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a 
broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amoun t of sale proceeds required to pay the full purchase price . Unless 
the Committee determines otherwise, no shares shall  be issued upon exercise of an Option until full pa yment for the 
shares has been made, including all amounts owed fo r tax withholding as discussed in Section 4 below .  
3.      Nontransferability. The Option is nonassignable and nontransferable by the Optionee, either voluntarily or 
by operation of law, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country  of the Optionee’ s 
domicile at the time of death, and during the Optio nee’s lifetime, the Option is exercisable only by t he Optionee.  
4.      Responsibility for Taxes. The Optionee shall, immediately upon notification o f the amount due, if any, 
pay to the Company by wire transfer, or irrevocably  instruct a broker to pay from stock sales proceeds , amounts 
necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. If addition al withholding is or 
becomes required (as a result of exercise of the Op tion or as a result of disposition of shares acquir ed pursuant to 
exercise of the Option) beyond any amount deposited  before delivery of the certificates, the Optionee shall pay such 
amount to the Company, by wire transfer, on demand.  If the Optionee fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company 
or the Employer may withhold that amount from other  amounts payable to the Optionee, including salary,  subject to 
applicable law.  
5.      Changes in Capital Structure. If the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Co mpany are hereafter 
increased or decreased or changed into or exchanged  for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the 
Company by reason of any recapitalization, reclassi fication, stock split, combination of shares or div idend payable in 
shares, appropriate adjustment shall be made by the  Committee in the number and kind of shares subject  to the Option, 
and the purchase price for shares subject to the Op tion, so that the Optionee’ s proportionate interest before and after the 
occurrence of the event is maintained. Notwithstand ing the foregoing, the Committee shall have no obli gation to effect 
any adjustment that would or might result in the is suance of fractional shares, and any fractional sha res resulting from 
any adjustment may be disregarded  
 
 
 
 
or provided for in any manner determined by the Com mittee. Any such adjustments made by the Committee shall be 
conclusive.  
6.      Sale of the Company; Change in Control.  
6.1      Sale of the Company . If there shall occur a merger, consolidation or p lan of exchange involving 
the Company pursuant to which the outstanding share s of Common Stock of the Company are converted into  cash or 
other stock, securities or property, or a sale, lea se, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related 
transactions) of all, or substantially all, the ass ets of the Company, then either:  
6.1.1      the Option shall be converted into an option to acq uire stock of the surviving or acquiring 
corporation in the applicable transaction for a tot al purchase price equal to the total price applicab le to the 
unexercised portion of the Option, and with the amo unt and type of shares subject thereto and purchase  price per 
share thereof to be conclusively determined by the Committee, taking into account the relative values of the 
companies involved in the applicable transaction an d the exchange rate, if any, used in determining sh ares of the 
surviving corporation to be held by the former hold ers of the Company’ s Class B Common Stock following the 
applicable transaction, and disregarding fractional  shares; or  
6.1.2      the Option will become exercisable in full effectiv e as of the consummation of such 
transaction, and the Committee shall approve some a rrangement by which the Optionee shall have a reaso nable 
opportunity to exercise the Option effective as of the consummation of such transaction or otherwise r ealize the 
value of the Option, as determined by the Committee . If the Option is not exercised in accordance with  
procedures approved by the Committee, the Option sh all terminate (notwithstanding any provisions appar ently to 
the contrary in this Agreement).  
6.2      Change in Control . If Section 6.1.2 does not apply, the Option shall , following a reasonable 
Processing Period, become exercisable in full and m ay be exercised at any time before the Expiration D ate or before the

“Incumbent Director” shall also include each new di rector elected during such two- year period whose 
nomination or election was approved by two-thirds o f the Incumbent Directors then in office;  
(b)      At any time that the holders of the Class A Common Stock of the Company have

NIKE, INC.  
APPENDIX FOR NON-U.S. OPTIONEES  
STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN  
NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT  
This Appendix includes additional terms and conditi ons that govern Options for Optionees residing and/ or 
working outside of the United States and in one of the countries listed herein. Capitalized terms not  
 
 
 
 
explicitly defined in this Appendix but defined in the Agreement shall have the same definitions as in  the Agreement.  
This Appendix also includes information regarding c ertain issues of which the Optionee should be aware  with 
respect to participation in the Plan. The informati on is based on the securities, exchange control and  other laws in effect 
in the respective countries as of June 2015. Such l aws are often complex and change frequently. As a r esult, the 
Company strongly recommends that the Optionee not r ely on the information in this Appendix as the only  source of 
information relating to the consequences of partici pation in the Plan because the information may be o ut of date at the 
time that the Optionee exercises the Option or sell s shares of Class B Common Stock acquired upon exer cise of the 
Option.  
In addition, the information contained herein is ge neral in nature and may not apply to the Optionee’ s particular 
situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure the Optionee of a particular result. Accordi ngly, the Optionee is 
advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in the Optionee’ s country may apply to a 
particular situation.  
Further, if the Optionee is a citizen or resident o f a country other than the one in which the Optione e is currently 
working and/or residing, transfers employment after  the Option is granted or is considered resident of  another country 
for local law purposes, the information contained h erein may not be applicable to the Optionee in the same manner, and 
the Company shall determine, in its sole discretion , to what extent the additional terms and condition s included herein 
shall apply to the Optionee.  
Finally, the Company may, at any time and at its ow n discretion, restrict the available methods of exe rcising the 
Option/paying the purchase price or direct the repa triation of the proceeds of the sale of shares of C lass B Common 
Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option if it de ems it advisable for legal or administrative reason s.  
ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR ALL NON-U.S. OPTIONEES  
The following additional terms and conditions apply  to the Option if the Optionee is a resident of any  country 
other than the United States. Country- specific terms and conditions that apply to the Opt ion if the Optionee is a resident 
of the particular country begin on page APP-7.  
1.      Termination of Employment. Pursuant to Section 1 of Exhibit A to the Agreement , unless otherwise 
expressly provided for in the Agreement, in the eve nt of termination of the Optionee’ s employment or service, the 
Optionee’s right to vest in the Option, if any, wil l terminate on the date of termination, and the Opt ionee’s right to 
exercise the Option after termination of employment  or service, if any, will be measured by the date o f termination 
(except if termination is due to total disability o r death, in which case the exercisability period st arts following the 
Processing Period); provided , however, that the Company may determine, in its s ole discretion, that, regardless of the 
reason of the Optionee's termination (whether or no t in breach of local laws and whether or not later found to be invalid), 
vesting will cease on and the Optionee's right to e xercise the Option will be measured by the date of termination of 
active employment or service, which will not be ext ended by any notice period mandated under local law  ( e.g. , active 
employment or service would not include a period of  “garden leave” or similar period pursuant to local  law).  
2.      Responsibility for Taxes. This provision replaces Section 4 of Exhibit A to t he Agreement.  
Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to any or all in come tax, social 
insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, paymen t on account or other tax-related items related to the Optionee’ s 
participation in the Plan and legally applicable to  the Optionee or deemed by the Company or the Emplo yer to be an 
appropriate charge to the Optionee even if technica lly due by the Company or the  
 
 
 
 
Employer (“Tax-Related Items”), the Optionee acknow ledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax- Related Items is and 
remains the Optionee’ s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually  withheld by the Company or the Employer. 
The Optionee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representat ions or undertakings 
regarding the treatment of any Tax- Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited 
to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, t he issuance of shares of Class B Common Stock upon exercise of the 
Option, the subsequent sale of shares of Class B Co mmon Stock acquired pursuant to such issuance and t he receipt of 
any dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are und er no obligation to structure the terms of the gran t or any aspect of 
the Option to reduce or eliminate the Optionee’s li ability for Tax- Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  
Further, if the Optionee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Optionee acknowl edges that the 
Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as  applicable) may be required to withhold or account  for Tax-
Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding ev ent, as applicable, the Optionee will pay or make 
adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company a nd/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax- Related Items. In this regard, 
the Optionee authorizes the Company and/or the Empl oyer, or their respective agents, at their discreti on, to satisfy their 
withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Rela ted Items by one or a combination of the following:   
Notwithstanding the above, if the Optionee is a Sec tion 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange 
Act, then the Company will withhold in shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, unless the use of such 
withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse acc ounting 
consequences, in which case the Optionee may elect the form of withholding from the alternatives above .  
To avoid negative accounting treatmentDepending on the withholding method, the Company may 
withhold or account for Tax- Related Items by considering applicable minimum sta tutory withholding rates or other 
applicable withholding rates, including maximum app licable rates, in which case the Optionee will rece ive a refund of 
any over- withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlemen t to the Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation  for 
Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares , for tax purposes, the Optionee is deemed to have been issued the 
full number of shares subject to the exercised Opti on, notwithstanding that a number of the shares are  held back solely 
for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due  as a result of any aspect of the Optionee’s partic ipation in the Plan.  
Finally, the Optionee shall pay to the Company or t he Employer any amount of Tax- Related Items that 
the Company or the Employer may be required to with hold or account for as a result of the Optionee’ s participation in 
the Plan that are not, in the discretion of the Com pany or the Employer, satisfied by the means previo usly described. The 
Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares o r the proceeds of the sale of shares of Class B Com mon Stock, if the 
Optionee fails to comply with the Optionee’s obliga tions in connection with the Tax-Related Items.  
 
 (1)  withholding from the Optionee’ s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Opti onee by the 
Company and/or the Employer;  
(2)  withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Class B Common Stock acquired upon exercise 
of the Option either through a voluntary sale or th rough a mandatory sale arranged by the 
Company (on the Optionee’s behalf pursuant to this authorization); or  
(3)  withholding in shares to be issued upon exercise of  the Option.

Optionee may provide as a director of any parent, s ubsidiary or affiliate of the Company;  
3.10      the future value of the underlying shares of Class B Common Stock is unknown and cannot be 
predicted with certainty;  
3.11      if the underlying shares of Class B Common Stock do  not increase in value, the Option will have

the shares of Class B Common Stock acquired upon ex ercise may increase or decrease in value, even belo w the purchase 
price;  
3.13      no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Option 
resulting from termination of the Optionee’ s employment or service with the Company or the Emp loyer (for any reason 
whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local la bor laws and whether or not later found to be inval id) and in 
consideration of the grant of the Option to which t he Optionee is not otherwise entitled,  
 
 
 
 
the Optionee irrevocably agrees never to institute any claim against the Company, the Employer and any  subsidiary or 
affiliate of the Company and waives his or her abil ity, if any, to bring any such claim, and releases the Company, the 
Employer and any subsidiary or affiliate of the Com pany from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the f oregoing, any 
such claim is allowed by a court of competent juris diction, then by participating in the Plan, the Opt ionee shall be 
deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue suc h claim and agrees to execute any and all documents  necessary to 
request dismissal of withdrawal or such claims; and   
3.13      neither the Company, the Employer nor any other par ent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company

Option or the subsequent sale of any shares of Comm on Stock acquired upon exercise.

Optionee exercises the Option, the Optionee must fi le a Payment Report with the MOF through the Bank o f Japan within 
20 days of the date that the payment is made. The p recise reporting requirements vary depending on whe ther or not the 
relevant payment is made through a bank in Japan. P lease note that a Payment Report is required indepe ndently from a 
Securities Acquisition Report. Therefore, the Optio nee must file both a Payment Report and a Securitie s Acquisition

shares exceeds ¥100 million.  
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information . The Optionee will be required to report details o f any assets held

shares, in the report.

her certificate of employment. This confirmation is  an automatic procedure ( i.e. , the bank does not need to approval the 
remittance and the process should not take more tha n a single day). This confirmation is not necessary  if the Optionee 
pays the purchase price through any form of payment  whereby some or all of the shares purchased upon e xercise of the 
Option are sold to pay the purchase price, because in this case there is no remittance of funds out of  Korea.  
If the Optionee realizes US$500,000 or more from th e sale of shares or the receipt of dividends in a s ingle transaction, 
he or she must repatriate the proceeds to Korea wit hin 18 months of the sale or receipt.

brokerage fees and any Tax -Related Items and remit the balance in cash to the Optionee), to the extent that the Optionee

Russian authorized bank will not apply to the Optio nee.

SOUTH AFRICA  
Responsibility for Taxes. The following provision supplements Section 2 of th e Additional Terms for All Non- U.S. 
Optionees in this Appendix:  
By accepting the Option, the Optionee agrees that, immediately upon exercise of the Option, he or she will notify the 
Employer of the amount of any gain realized. If the  Optionee fails to advise the Employer of the gain realized upon 
exercise, he or she may be liable for a fine. The O ptionee will be solely responsible for paying any d ifference between 
the actual tax liability and the amount withheld.  
Tax Clearance Certificate for Cash Exercises. If the Optionee exercises the Option using a cash e xercise method, the 
Optionee must obtain and provide to the Employer, o r any third party designated by the Employer or the  Company, a 
Tax Clearance Certificate (with respect to Foreign Investments) bearing the official stamp and signatu re of the Exchange 
Control Department of the South African Revenue Ser vice (“SARS”). The Optionee must renew this Tax Clearance 
Certificate every twelve months, or such other peri od as may be required by the SARS. If the Optionee exercises by a 
cashless exercise method whereby no funds are remit ted out of South Africa, no Tax Clearance Certifica te is required.  
Exchange Control Information. To participate in the Plan, the Optionee must compl y with exchange control 
regulations in South Africa and neither the Company  nor the Employer will be liable for any fines or p enalties resulting 
from the Optionee’s failure to comply with applicab le laws.  
Under current South African exchange control regula tions, the Optionee may invest a maximum of ZAR11,0 00,000 in 
offshore investments, including in shares of Class B Common Stock. The first ZAR1,000,000 annual discr etionary 
allowance requires no prior authorization. The next  ZAR10,000,000 requires tax clearance. This limit d oes not apply to 
non -resident employees. It is the Optionee’ s responsibility to ensure that he or she does not exceed this limit. The 
Optionee should note that this is a cumulative allo wance and that his or her ability to remit funds fo r the purchase of the 
shares will be reduced if the Optionee’ s foreign investment limit is utilized to make a tr ansfer of funds offshore that is 
unrelated to the Plan. If the Optionee wishes to ex ercise his or her Option through a cash purchase ex ercise and the 
ZAR11,000,000 limit would be exceeded upon the exer cise of the Option, the Optionee may still transfer  funds for 
payment of the shares provided that he or she immed iately sells the shares and repatriates the full pr oceeds to South 
Africa. There is no repatriation requirement on the  sale proceeds if the ZAR11,000,000 limit is not ex ceeded. If the 
Optionee exercises the Option using a cashless exer cise, the value of the shares thus purchased will n ot be counted 
against the Optionee’s offshore investment allowanc e.  
The Optionee should consult his or her personal adv isor to ensure compliance with applicable exchange control 
regulations in South Africa; as such regulations ar e subject to frequent change. The Optionee is respo nsible for ensuring 
compliance with all exchange control laws in South Africa.  
 
 
 
 
SPAIN  
Nature of Grant. This provision supplements Section 3 of the Additio nal Terms for All Non- U.S. Optionees in this 
Appendix:  
In accepting the Option, the Optionee consents to p articipate in the Plan and acknowledges that he or she has received a 
copy of the Plan.  
The Optionee understands that the Company has unila terally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to  grant stock 
options under the Plan to individuals who may be em ployees of the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate  throughout the 
world. The decision is a limited decision that is e ntered into upon the express assumption and conditi on that any grant 
will not economically or otherwise bind the Company  or any subsidiary or affiliate. Consequently, the Optionee 
understands that the Option is granted on the assum ption and condition that the Option and any shares acquired upon 
exercise of the Option are not part of any employme nt contract (either with the Company or any subsidi ary or affiliate) 
and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, sa lary for any purposes (including severance compensa tion) or any 
other right whatsoever. In addition, the Optionee u nderstands that the Option would not be granted to the Optionee but 
for the assumptions and conditions referred to here in; thus, the Optionee acknowledges and freely acce pts that should 
any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should  any of the conditions not be met for any reason, t hen the grant of this 
Option shall be null and void.  
This Option is a conditional right to shares of Cla ss B Common Stock and can be forfeited in the case of, or affected by, 
the Optionee’ s termination of employment. This will be the case,  for example, even if (1) the Optionee is considere d to 
be unfairly dismissed without good cause; (2) the O ptionee is dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a 
collective dismissal; (3) the Optionee terminates e mployment due to a change of work location, duties or any other 
employment or contractual condition; (4) the Option ee terminates employment due to unilateral breach o f contract of the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (5) the Opti onee’s employment terminates for any other reason whatso ever, 
except for reasons specified in Sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, or 1.6 of Exhibit A to the Agreement. Conseque ntly, upon 
termination of the Optionee’ s employment for any of the reasons set forth above , the Optionee may automatically lose 
any rights to the unvested Options granted to him o r her as of the date of the Optionee’ s termination of employment, as 
described in the Plan and the Exhibit A to the Agre ement.  
Exchange Control Information. The Optionee must declare the acquisition and sale of shares to the Dirección General 
de Comercio y Inversiones (the “DGCI”) for statistical purposes. Because the Optionee will  not purchase or sell the 
shares through the use of a Spanish financial insti tution, the Optionee must make the declaration hims elf or herself by 
filing a D-6 form with the DGCI. Generally, the D-6  form must be filed each January while the shares a re owned.  
 
When receiving foreign currency payments derived fr om the ownership of shares ( i.e. , cash dividends or sale proceeds) 
exceeding € 50,000, the Optionee must inform the financial inst itution receiving the payment of the basis upon whi ch 
such payment is made. The Optionee will need to pro vide the financial institution with the following i nformation: (i) the 
Optionee’ s name, address and fiscal identification number; ( ii) the name and corporate domicile of the Company;  (iii) 
the amount of the payment; (iv) the currency used; (v) the country of origin; (vi) the reasons for the  payment; and (vii) 
additional information that may be required. In add ition, if the Optionee wishes to import the ownersh ip title of any 
shares ( i.e. , share certificates) into Spain, he or she must de clare the import of such securities to the DGCI.  
 
Securities Law Information. No “offer of securities to the public,” as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or 
will take place in the Spanish territory in connect ion with the grant of the Options. The Agreement

year exceed €1,000,000.  
Further, to the extent that the Optionee holds shar es and/or has bank accounts outside Spain with a va lue in excess of 
€50,000 (for each type of asset) as of December 31, the Optionee will be required to report information  on such assets on 
his or her tax return (tax form 720) for such year.  After such shares and/or accounts are initially re ported, the reporting 
obligation will apply for subsequent years only if the value of any previously- reported shares or accounts increases by 
more than €20,000.

Appendix:  
The Optionee hereby acknowledges that he or she has rea d and understood the terms regarding collection, pr ocessing 
and transfer of Data contained in this Appendix and  by participating in the Plan, the Optionee  
 
 
 
 
agrees to such terms. In this regard, upon request of the Company or the Employer, the Optionee agrees  to provide an 
executed data privacy consent form to the Employer or the Company (or any other agreements or consents  that may be 
required by the Employer or the Company) that the C ompany and/or the Employer may deem necessary to ob tain under 
the data privacy laws in the Optionee’ s country, either now or in the future. The Optione e understands he or she will not

sale of shares of Common Stock and the receipt of a ny dividends) into and out of Taiwan up to US$5,000 ,000 per year. 
If the transaction amount is TWD500,000 or more in a single transaction, the Optionee must submit a fo reign exchange 
transaction form and also provide supporting docume ntation to the satisfaction of the remitting bank.  
If the transaction amount is US$500,000 or more, th e Optionee may be required to provide additional su pporting 
documentation to the satisfaction of the remitting bank. The Optionee should consult his or her person al advisor to 
ensure compliance with applicable exchange control laws in Taiwan.  
THAILAND  
Exchange Control Information. If the Optionee remits funds out of Thailand to exe rcise his or her Option, it is the 
Optionee’ s responsibility to comply with applicable exchange  control laws. Under current exchange control regul ations, 
Optionee may remit funds out of Thailand up to US$1 ,000,000 per year to purchase shares (and otherwise  invest in 
securities abroad) by submitting an application to an authorized agent, ( i.e. , a commercial bank authorized by the Bank 
of Thailand to engage in the purchase, exchange and  withdrawal of foreign currency). The application i ncludes the 
Foreign Exchange Transaction Form, a letter describ ing the Option, a copy of the Plan and related docu ments, and 
evidence showing the nexus between the Company and the Employer. If the Optionee uses a cashless metho d of exercise 
that does not involve remitting funds out of Thaila nd, this requirement does not apply.  
When the Optionee sells shares issued upon exercise  of the Option or receives dividends, the Optionee must immediately 
repatriate the cash proceeds to Thailand, and then convert such proceeds to Thai Baht within 360 days of repatriation. If 
the amount of the Optionee’ s proceeds in a single transaction exceeds US$50,00 0, the Optionee must specifically report

traded on the New York Stock Exchange, which is loc ated outside of Turkey, under the ticker symbol “NK E” and the 
shares may be sold through this exchange.  
 
 
 
 
Exchange Control Information. The Optionee likely will be required to engage a Tu rkish financial intermediary to 
assist with the purchase of shares upon exercise of  the Option, if the Optionee uses a cash exercise m ethod, and the 
subsequent sale of shares acquired under the Plan. As the Optionee is solely responsible for complying  with the financial 
intermediary requirements and because the applicati on of the requirements to participation in the Plan  is uncertain, the 
Optionee should consult his or her personal legal a dvisor prior to exercising the Option or selling an y shares to ensure 
compliance.

“UK Sub-Plan”). By accepting this Option grant, the Optionee agrees  to all of the terms and conditions of the Option

with the value of the shares underlying other outst anding Options granted under the UK Sub- Plan and held by the 
Optionee, exceeds £ 30,000, then the number of shares in excess of the threshold will not be subject to the terms

The following specific modifications to the Agreeme nt apply in relation to the Option granted under th e UK Sub-Plan:  
Section 5. No adjustment to the Option granted under the UK Su b-Plan shall take effect until it has been approved b y

The Optionee agrees that, if the Optionee does not pay or the Employer or the Company does not withhol d from the 
Optionee the full amount of income tax that the Opt ionee owes at exercise of the Option, or the releas e or assignment of 
the Option for consideration, or the receipt of any  other benefit in connection with the Option (the “ Taxable Event” ) 
within 90 days of the end of the U.K. tax year in w hich the Taxable Event occurs, or such other period  specified in 
section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the “Due Date”), then the amount that 
should have been withheld shall constitute a loan o wed by the Optionee to the Employer, effective on t he Due Date. The 
Optionee agrees that the loan will bear interest at  the HMRC’ s Official Rate and will be immediately due and rep ayable 
by the Optionee, and the Company and/or the Employe r may recover it at any time thereafter by withhold ing the funds 
from salary, bonus or any other funds due to the Op tionee by the Employer, by withholding from the cas h proceeds from 
the sale of shares or by demanding cash or a check from the Optionee. The Optionee also authorizes the  Company to 
delay the issuance of any shares unless and until t he loan is repaid in full.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Optionee is a  director or executive officer (as within the meani ng of Section 13(k) 
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as  amended), the terms of the immediately foregoing p rovision will not 
apply. In the event that the Optionee is a director  or executive officer and income tax is not collect ed from or paid by the 
Optionee by the Due Date, the amount of any uncolle cted income tax may constitute a benefit to the Opt ionee on which 
additional income tax and National Insurance contri butions may be payable. The Optionee acknowledges t hat the 
Company or the Employer may recover any such additi onal income tax and National Insurance contribution s at any time 
thereafter by any of the means referred to in Secti on 2 of the Additional Terms for All Non- U.S. Optionees in this 
Appendix, although the Optionee acknowledges that h e/she ultimately will be responsible for reporting and paying any 
income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self- assessment regime and for reimbursing the 
Company or the Employer, as applicable, for the val ue of any National Insurance contributions due on t his additional 
benefit, which the Company or the Employer may reco ver from the Optionee at any time by any of the mea ns referred to 
in Section 2 of the Additional Terms for All Non-U. S. Optionees in this Appendix.

4. Forfeiture Restriction .

reason, with or without Cause, any RSUs that did no t vest pursuant to Section 2 above at or prior to t he time of such 
termination of employment or service shall be forfe ited to the Company; provided, however, that if the  Recipient’s 
employment or service is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Recipient for Good Reason a fter 
Shareholder Approval but before a Change in Control , any RSUs will not be forfeited under this sentenc e unless a 
Change in Control does not subsequently occur withi n one year following the Recipient’s termination of  employment or 
service. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon the Recipient any right to be employed by the Company 
or any Employer or to continue to provide services to the Company or any Employer or to interfere in a ny way with the 
right of the Company or any Employer to terminate t he Recipient’s services at any time for any reason,  with or without 
Cause.  
2. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement , any Shares or Dividend Equivalent Payment that 
have not yet been settled and paid pursuant to Sect ion 3, or following Shareholder Approval but prior to a Change of 
Control as contemplated by Section 4.1, shall be fo rfeited and no such delivery shall occur if, during  the Employment 
Period (as defined in Section 11(a)), and at any ti me prior to such delivery thereafter (the “Restrict ion Period”), the 
Recipient , directly or indirectly, owns, manages, controls or participates in the ownership, manageme nt or control of, or 
becomes employed by, consults for or becomes connec ted in any manner with, any business engaged anywhe re in the 
world in the athletic footwear, athletic apparel or  sports equipment, sports electronics/technology an d sports accessories 
business or any other business that directly compet es with the then- current existing or reasonably anticipated business  of 
the Company or any of its parent, subsidiaries or a ffiliated corporations (a “Competitor”). The Compan y has the option, 
in its sole discretion, to elect to waive all or a portion of the Restriction Period or to limit the d efinition of Competitor.  
5. Restriction on Transfer . The RSUs are nonassignable and nontransferable by  the Recipient, either voluntarily 
or by operation of law, except by will or by the la ws of descent and distribution of the state or coun try of the Recipient’ s 
domicile at the time of death.  
6. Responsibility for Taxes . The Recipient acknowledges that, regardless of an y action taken by the Company 
or, if different, the Employer the ultimate liabili ty for all income tax, social insurance, payroll ta x, fringe benefits tax, 
payment on account or other tax-related items relat ed to the Recipient’ s participation in the Plan and legally applicable 
to the Recipient or deemed by the Company or the Em ployer to be an appropriate charge to the Recipient  even if 
technically due by the Company or the Employer (“ Tax-Related Items ”), is and remains the Recipient’ s responsibility 
and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Recipient further ackn owledges 
that the Company and/or the Employer (a) make no re presentations or undertakings regarding the treatme nt of any Tax-
Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, ves ting or settlement of 
the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pu rsuant to such settlement and the receipt of any di vidends or any 
Dividend Equivalent Payment, and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the ter ms of the grant or 
any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the R ecipient’s liability for Tax- Related Items or achieve any particular 
tax result. Further, if the Recipient is subject to  Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between  the date of 
grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax w ithholding event, as  
 
 
 
 
applicable, the Recipient acknowledges that the Com pany and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applica ble) may 
be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding ev ent, as applicable, the Recipient agrees to make ad equate 
arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the  Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  
In this regard, the Recipient authorizes the Compan y and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their 
discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of  the following:  
Notwithstanding the above, if the Recipient is a Se ction 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, as 
amended, then the Company will withhold in Shares t o be issued upon settlement of the RSUs, unless the  use of such 
withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse acc ounting 
consequences, in which case the Recipient may elect  the form of withholding from the alternatives abov e.  
Depending on the withholding method, the Company ma y withhold or account for Tax- Related Items by 
considering applicable minimum statutory withholdin g rates or other applicable withholding rates, incl uding maximum 
applicable rates, in which case the Recipient will receive a refund of any over- withheld amount in cash and will have no 
entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax- Related Items is satisfied by withholding in 
Shares, for tax purposes, the Recipient is deemed t o have been issued the full number of Shares subjec t to the vested 
RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares a re held back solely for the purpose of paying the T ax-Related Items. 
Finally, the Recipient agrees to pay to the Company  or the Employer, any amount of Tax- Related Items that the 
Company or the Employer may be required to withhold  or account for as a result of the Recipient’ s participation in the 
Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previous ly described. The Company may refuse to issue or de liver the Shares 
or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if the Recip ient fails to comply with the Recipient’ s obligations in connection with 
the Tax-Related Items.  
8. Changes in Capital Structure . If, prior to the full vesting of all of the RSUs granted under this Agreement, the 
outstanding Class B Common Stock of the Company is increased or decreased or changed into or exchanged  for a 
different number or kind of shares or other securit ies of the Company by reason of any recapitalizatio n, reclassification, 
stock split, combination of shares or dividend paya ble in shares, appropriate adjustment shall be made  by the Committee 
in the number and kind of shares subject to the unv ested RSUs so that the Recipient’ s proportionate interest before and 
after the occurrence of the event is maintained. No twithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall ha ve no obligation 
to effect any adjustment that would or might result  in the issuance of fractional shares, and any frac tional shares 
resulting from any adjustment may be disregarded or  provided for in any manner determined by the Commi ttee. Any 
such adjustments made by the Committee shall be con clusive.  
 
 (i)  withholding from any Dividend Equivalent Payment; 
(ii)  withholding from the Recipient’ s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Reci pient by the Company 
and/or the Employer;  
(iii)  withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acq uired upon vesting/settlement of the RSUs either th rough 
a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arrang ed by the Company (on the Recipient’ s behalf pursuant to 
this authorization); or  
(iv)  withholding in Shares to be issued upon settlement of the RSUs. 
7.  Rights as Shareholder . Until delivery of the Shares underlying the veste d RSUs to the Recipient, the Recipient 
has only the rights of a general unsecured creditor , and no rights as a shareholder of the Company.  
 
 
9. Sale of the Company . If there shall occur a merger, consolidation or p lan of exchange involving the Company 
pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Class B  Common Stock of the Company are converted into cas h or other 
stock, securities or property, or a sale, lease, ex change or other transfer (in one transaction or a s eries of related 
transactions) of all, or substantially all, the ass ets of the Company, then either:  
1. the unvested RSUs shall be converted into restricte d stock units for stock of the surviving or acquiri ng 
corporation in the applicable transaction, with the  amount and type of shares subject thereto to be co nclusively 
determined by the Committee, taking into account th e relative values of the companies involved in the applicable 
transaction and the exchange rate, if any, used in determining shares of the surviving corporation to be held by the 
former holders of the Company’ s Class B Common Stock following the applicable tra nsaction, and disregarding 
fractional shares; or  
2. all of the unvested RSUs shall immediately vest and  all underlying Shares and the Dividend Equivalent 
Payment shall be delivered simultaneously with the closing of the applicable transaction such that the  Recipient will 
participate as a shareholder in receiving proceeds from such transaction with respect to those Shares.   
10. Section 409A . The parties intend that this Agreement and the be nefits provided hereunder be exempt from 
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the  maximum extent possible, whether pursuant to the s hort-term 
deferral exception described in Treasury Regulation  Section 1.409A- 1(b)(4) or otherwise. To the extent Section 409A of  
the Code is applicable to this Agreement and such b enefits, the parties intend that this Agreement and  such benefits 
comply with the deferral, payout, and other limitat ions and restrictions imposed under Section 409A of  the Code. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreeme nt or an employment agreement or other agreement to  the contrary,

“separation from service” ( within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) wit hin thirty (30) days following the earlier 
of (i) the expiration of the six-month period follo wing the Recipient’s separation from service, and ( ii) the Recipient’ s 
death, to the extent such delayed payment is otherw ise required to avoid a prohibited distribution und er Section 409A of 
the Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code,  each payment or benefit payable pursuant to this A greement shall 
be treated as a separate payment. Notwithstanding t he foregoing, this Agreement and the Plan may be am ended by the 
Company at any time, without the consent of any par ty, to the extent necessary or desirable to satisfy  any of the 
requirements under Section 409A of the Code, but th e Company shall not be under any obligation to make  any such 
amendment. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan sh all provide a basis for any person to take action a gainst the 
Company or any affiliate based on matters covered b y Section 409A of the Code, including the tax treat ment of any 
amount paid or RSUs granted under this Agreement, a nd neither the Company nor any of its affiliates sh all under any 
circumstances have any liability to the Recipient o r his or her estate or any other party for any taxe s, penalties or interest 
due on amounts paid or payable under this Agreement , including taxes, penalties or interest imposed un der Section 409A 
of the Code.

approved from time to time by the Board of Director s or the Committee.  
In addition, the Company may require the Recipient to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the RS Us and any 
shares or other amount or property that may be issu ed, delivered or paid in respect of the RSUs, as we ll as any

By accepting the RSUs, the Recipient agrees that, i mmediately upon vesting of the RSUs, he or she will  notify the 
Employer of the amount of any gain realized. If the  Recipient fails to advise the Employer of the gain  realized upon 
vesting, he or she may be liable for a fine. The Re cipient will be solely responsible for paying any d ifference between 
the actual tax liability and the amount withheld.  
Exchange Control Information. The Recipient should consult his or her personal ad visor to ensure compliance with 
applicable exchange control regulations in South Af rica, as such regulations are subject to frequent c hange. The 
Recipient is responsible for ensuring compliance wi th all exchange control laws in South Africa.  
SPAIN  
Labor Law Acknowledgment. In accepting the RSUs, the Recipient consents to pa rticipate in the Plan and 
acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of the Plan.  
The Recipient understands that the Company has unil aterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided t o grant stock 
RSUs under the Plan to individuals who may be emplo yees of the Company or a parent or subsidiary corpo ration 
throughout the world. The decision is a limited dec ision that is entered into upon the express assumpt ion and condition 
that any grant will not economically or otherwise b ind the Company, the Employer, or any parent or sub sidiary 
corporation. Consequently, the Recipient understand s that the RSUs are granted on the assumption and c ondition that the 
RSUs and any Shares acquired upon vesting of the RS Us are not part of any employment contract (either with the 
Company, the Employer, or any parent or subsidiary corporation) and shall not be considered a mandator y benefit, salary 
for any purposes (including severance compensation)  or any other right whatsoever. Further, the Recipi ent understands 
and freely accepts that there is no guarantee that any benefit whatsoever shall arise from any gratuit ous and discretionary 
grant since the future value of the RSUs and the un derlying Shares is unknown and unpredictable. In ad dition, the 
Recipient understands that the RSUs would not be gr anted to the Recipient but for the assumptions and conditions 
referred to herein; thus, the Recipient acknowledge s and freely accepts that should any or all of the assumptions be 
mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met  for any reason, then the grant of the RSUs shall b e null and void.  
The RSUs are a conditional right to Shares and can be forfeited in the case of, or affected by, the Re cipient’s termination 
of service or employment. This will be the case, fo r example, even if (1) the Recipient is considered to be unfairly 
dismissed without good cause; (2) the Recipient is dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective 
dismissal; (3) the Recipient terminates employment or service due to a change of work location, duties  or any other 
employment or contractual condition; (4) the Recipi ent terminates employment or service due to unilate ral breach of 
contract of the Company, the Employer, or any  
 
 
 
 
parent or subsidiary corporation; or (5) the Recipi ent’s employment or service terminates for any other re ason 
whatsoever, except for reasons specified in the Agr eement. Consequently, upon termination of the Recip ient’s 
employment or service for any of the reasons set fo rth above, the Recipient may automatically lose any  rights to the 
unvested RSUs granted to him or her as of the date of the Recipient’ s termination of employment, as described in the 
Plan and the Agreement.  
Exchange Control Information. The Recipient must declare the acquisition of Share s to the Dirección General de 
Comercial e Inversiones (the “ DGCI ”) of the Ministerio de Economia for statistical purposes. The Recipient must also 
declare ownership of any Shares by filing a D- 6 form with the DGCI each January while the Shares are owned. In 
addition, if the Recipient wishes to import the own ership title of any Shares ( i.e., share certificates) into Spain, he or she 
must declare the importation of such securities to the DGCI.  
When receiving foreign currency payments derived fr om the ownership of Shares ( i.e. , cash dividends, Dividend 
Equivalent Payment or sale proceeds) in excess of € 50,000, the Recipient must inform the financial ins titution receiving 
the payment of the basis upon which such payment is  made. The Recipient will need to provide the finan cial institution 
with the following information: (i) the Recipient’ s name, address and fiscal identification number; ( ii) the name and 
corporate domicile of the Company; (iii) the amount  of the payment; (iv) the currency used; (v) the co untry of origin; 
(vi) the reasons for the payment; and (vii) additio nal information that may be required.

considered a private placement outside of the scope  of Spanish laws on public offerings and issuances of securities.  
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. The Recipient is required to declare electronically  to the Bank of

year exceed €1,000,000.  
Further, to the extent that the Recipient holds Sha res and/or has bank accounts outside Spain with a v alue in excess of 
€50,000 (for each type of asset) as of December 31, the Recipient will be required to report informatio n on such assets 
on his or her tax return (tax form 720) for such ye ar. After such Shares and/or accounts are initially  reported, the 
reporting obligation will apply for subsequent year s only if the value of any previously- reported Shares or accounts

agrees that the Company is authorized to instruct i ts designated broker to assist with the mandatory s ale of such Shares

for the sale of the Shares at any particular price.  Furthermore, the Recipient acknowledges that the s ale of Shares will  
 
 
 
 
be made as soon as administratively possible after vesting, but the Company is not committing to sell the Shares at any 
particular time after vesting.  
Upon the sale of the Shares, the Company agrees to pay the Recipient the cash proceeds from the sale o f the Shares, less 
any brokerage fees or commissions and subject to an y obligation to satisfy Tax-Related Items.  
Exchange Control Information. Upon the sale of Shares, the Recipient is required to repatriate any proceeds received 
from such sale back to Sri Lanka. The Recipient may  be required to obtain exchange control approval in  Sri Lanka in 
order to hold sales proceeds in an account outside of Sri Lanka. The Recipient is advised to consult w ith his or her 
personal legal advisor to determine his or her resp onsibilities under Sri Lankan exchange control laws .  
SWEDEN  
There are no country-specific provisions.  
SWITZERLAND  
Securities Law Information. The grant of the RSUs is considered a private offer ing in Switzerland and is, therefore, 
not subject to registration in Switzerland.  
TAIWAN  
Data Privacy . The following provisions supplement Section 2 of Appendix A:  
The Recipient hereby acknowledges that he or she has re ad and understood the terms regarding collection, p rocessing 
and transfer of Data contained in this Appendix and  by participating in the Plan, the Recipient agree to such terms. In 
this regard, upon request of the Company or the Emp loyer, the Recipient agrees to provide an executed data privacy 
consent form to the Employer or the Company (or any  other agreements or consents that may be required by the 
Employer or the Company) that the Company and/or th e Employer may deem necessary to obtain under the d ata privacy 
laws in the Recipient’ s country, either now or in the future. The Recipie nt understands he or she will not be able to 
participate in the Plan if the Recipient fails to e xecute any such consent or agreement.  
Securities Law Information. The RSUs and the underlying Shares are available on ly for certain employees of the 
Company, the Employer and other parent or subsidiar y corporations. It is not a public offer of securit ies by a Taiwanese 
company. Therefore, it is exempt from registration in Taiwan.  
 
 
 
 
Exchange Control Information. The Recipient may acquire foreign currency (includi ng proceeds from the sale of 
Shares and the receipt of any dividends or Dividend  Equivalent Payments) into Taiwan up to US$5,000,00 0 per year. If 
the transaction amount is TWD500,000 or more in a s ingle transaction, the Recipient must submit a fore ign exchange 
transaction form and also provide supporting docume ntation to the satisfaction of the handling bank.  
If the transaction amount is US$500,000 or more, th e Recipient may be required to provide additional s upporting 
documentation to the satisfaction of the bank. The Recipient should consult his or her personal adviso r to ensure 
compliance with applicable exchange control laws in  Taiwan.  
THAILAND  
Exchange Control Information. When the Recipient sells Shares issued upon vesting  of the RSUs or receives 
dividends or Dividend Equivalent Payments, the Reci pient must repatriate all cash proceeds to Thailand  and then 
convert such proceeds to Thai Baht within 360 days of repatriation. If the amount of the Recipient’ s proceeds is 
US$50,000 or more, the Recipient must specifically report the inward remittance to the Bank of Thailan d on a foreign 
exchange transaction form. If the Recipient fails t o comply with these obligations, the Recipient may be subject to 
penalties assessed by the Bank of Thailand.  
The Recipient should consult his or her personal ad visor prior to taking any action with respect to re mittance of cash 
proceeds into Thailand. The Recipient is responsibl e for ensuring compliance with all exchange control  laws in 
Thailand.  
TURKEY  
Securities Law Information. By accepting the RSUs, the Recipient understands an d agrees that he or she is not 
permitted to sell any Shares acquired under the Pla n in Turkey. The Shares are currently traded on the  New York Stock 
Exchange, which is located outside of Turkey, under  the ticker symbol “NKE” and the Shares may be sold through this 
exchange.  
Exchange Control Information. The Recipient likely will be required to engage a T urkish financial intermediary to 
assist with the sale of Shares acquired under the P lan. While the Recipient should not need to engage a Turkish financial 
intermediary with respect to the acquisition of suc h Shares (as no consideration is paid), this is les s certain. As the 
Recipient is solely responsible for complying with the financial intermediary requirements and because  the application 
of the requirements to participation in the Plan is  uncertain, the Recipient should consult his or her  personal legal advisor 
prior to the vesting of the RSUs or any sale of Sha res to ensure compliance.  
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES  
Securities Law Information . The offer of RSUs under the Plan is made only to certain employees who meet the 
eligibility requirements in the Plan, and constitut es an “exempt personal offer” of equity incentives to employees in the 
United Arab Emirates. The Agreement, the Plan, and other incidental communication materials are intend ed for 
distribution only to employees and must not be deli vered to, or relied on, by any other person.  
The Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority a nd/or the Central Bank have no responsibility for r eviewing or 
verifying any documents in connection with this sta tement. The Ministry of Economy, the Dubai Departme nt of 
Economic Development, the Emirates Securities and C ommodities Authority, Central Bank and the Dubai Fi nancial 
Securities Authority, depending on the employee’ s location in the United Arab Emirates, have not ap proved this 
statement, the Plan, the Agreement or any other doc uments the Recipient  
 
 
 
 
may receive in connection with the RSUs or taken st eps to verify the information set out therein, and have no 
responsibility for such documents.  
If the Recipient does not understand the contents o f the Agreement or the Plan, the Recipient should c onsult his or her 
personal financial advisor.  
UNITED KINGDOM

in connection with the RSUs (the “ Taxable Event ”) within 90 days of the end of the U.K. tax year in w hich the 
Taxable Event occurs, or such other period specifie d in section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earn ings and 
Pensions) Act 2003 (the “ Due Date ”), then the amount that should have been withheld shal l constitute a loan owed by 
the Recipient to the Employer, effective on the Due  Date. The Recipient agrees that the loan will bear  interest at the 
HMRC’s Official Rate and will be immediately due and rep ayable by the Recipient, and the Company and/or the  
Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by w ithholding by any of the means set forth in the Agr eement. The 
Recipient also authorizes the Company to delay the issuance of any Shares unless and until the loan is  repaid in full.  
 
If the Recipient is a director or executive officer  (as within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the U.S . Securities and 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), the Recipient is  not eligible for such a loan and the terms of the immediately 
foregoing provision will not apply to the Recipient . In the event that the Recipient is a director or executive officer, as 
defined above, and income tax is not collected from  or paid by the Recipient by the Due Date, the amou nt of any 
uncollected income tax may constitute a benefit to the Recipient on which additional income tax and Na tional Insurance 
contributions (“ NICs ”) may be payable. The Recipient will be responsible f or reporting and paying any income tax due 
on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under t he self-assessment regime and for reimbursing the Company o r the 
Employer, as applicable, for the value of any emplo yee NICs due on this additional benefit, which the Company or the 
Employer may recover from the Recipient at any time  by any of the means referred to in Section 6 of th e Agreement.
