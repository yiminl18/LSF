ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the S
tate of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “NIKE” and the “Company” refer to NIKE, Inc. and itspredecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our NIKE digital commerce website is located at 
www.nike.com . On our NIKE corporate website, located at 
investors.nike.com , we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”): our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and
any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our definitive ProxyStatements are also posted on our corporate website. All such filings on our corporate website are available free of charge. Copies of these
 filings are also available on theSEC's website (
www.sec.gov ). Also available on our corporate website are the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIK
E Investor Relations, OneBowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453.
Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the
largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products directly to consumers through NIKE-owned retail stores and digital platforms (which we refer to
collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations) and to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around
the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our digital platforms. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors.
Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States
 and abroad.PRODUCTS
We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in six key categories: Running, NIKE
 Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear (our sports-inspiredlifestyle products). We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses, such as American football, baseball, cricket, golf
, lacrosse,skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, walking, wrestling and other outdoor activities. In June 2020, we announced that we will align our product creation and category organizations
around a new consumer construct focused on Men’s, Women’s and Kids'. This approach is intended to allow us to create product 
that better meets individual consumer needs,including more specialization of our category approach, while re-aligning and simplifying our business to accelerate our largest growth opportunities.
NIKE's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place
considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running are
currently our top-selling footwear categories, and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales.
We also sell sports apparel covering the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and
distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use, although many of the products are
worn for casual or leisure purposes, and demonstrates our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Training, Football (Soccer) and Running are
currently our top-selling apparel categories, and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in “collections” of
similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.
We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats,
 gloves,protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-
owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.
2021 FORM 10-K

Table of ContentsOur Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark.
Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under
the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack 
Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into
 license agreementsthat permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for
sports activities.
We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our digital platforms, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content; and
 digitalservices and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience.
SALES AND MARKETING
We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the
second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of
footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors, as evidenced by the impact of the CO
VID-19 pandemic.Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as well as changing design trends, a
ffect thedemand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts
 in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing newproducts, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a
material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the
design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are:
 NorthAmerica; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific &
 Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. The Hurleybrand results, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, were included in North America. Sales through our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating
segment.
Converse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and
accessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results.
UNITED STATES MARKET
For fiscal 2021, NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted
 for approximately 39% of total revenues, compared to 39% and 41% for fiscal 2020 and fiscal2019, respectively. We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand and Converse products to thousands o
f retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores,sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and
 golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices tosolicit such sales. During fiscal 2021, our three largest United States customers accounted for approximately 24% of sales in the United S
tates.Our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand and Converse products to consumers through various digital platforms. In
addition, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell products through the following number of retail stores in the United States:

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER
No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net Revenues during fiscal 2021.
PRODUCT RESEARCH, DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
We believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of 
footwear, appareland athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while
reducing waste.
In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and
related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, physicians and
other experts who consult with us and review certain designs, materials and concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product
safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other a
thletes wear-test and evaluate products during thedesign and development process.
As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout
our product categories and consumer applications. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in
existing categories to respond to consumer preferences. The proliferation of NIKE Air, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, React
 andAdapt technologies, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.
MANUFACTURING
We are supplied by 191 footwear factories located in 14 countries. Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the
 United States by over 15 independent contractmanufacturers, which often operate multiple factories. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 9% of total 
fiscal 2021 NIKE Brand footwear production.For fiscal 2021, contract factories in Vietnam, Indonesia and China manufactured approximately 51%, 24% and 21% of
 total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also havemanufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina and India to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. For fiscal 2021,
four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of 
footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 61% of NIKE Brandfootwear production.
2021 FORM 10-K

Table of ContentsWe are supplied by 344 apparel factories located in 33 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 8% of total fiscal 2021 NI
KE Brand apparelproduction. Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract
 manufacturers, which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal2021, contract factories in Vietnam, China and Cambodia produced approximately 30%, 19% and 12% of total NIK
E Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2021, two apparelcontract manufacturers each accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the 
top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 51% ofNIKE Brand apparel production.
The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon,
polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2021, Air Manufacturing Innovation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon, in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were
our suppliers of materials and cushioning components used in footwear. Air Manufacturing Innovation also manufactures and sells small amounts of various other plastic
products to other manufacturers. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled);
specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKE's
independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and
purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contractors and
 suppliers have thus farexperienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products.
Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (“Sojitz America”), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed import-
export financing services for us.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE
Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the
 implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign anddomestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain
parts of the world, political tensions, instability, conflicts, nationalism and terrorism. We have not, to date, been
 materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict thelikelihood of such material effects occurring in the future.
In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These
trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are
facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to 
theindustry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional
measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.
We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to
mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and
advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for 
trade liberalizationfor footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs
 orpenalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by other countries, could negatively affect U.S. corporations, including NIKE, with business operations and/or consumer
markets in those countries, which could also make it necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, either o
f which may have an adverse effect on our business,financial condition or our results of operations. In addition, with respect to proposed trade restrictions, we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade
associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent
with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers domestic economies and the important role they may play in the global economic community.
Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the
 productsobtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted
and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would,
therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be
 as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or "FCPA",
 and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. Wesource a significant portion of our products from, and have important consumer

 ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents,suppliers and other partners.
COMPETITION
The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure
footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear,
apparel and equipment, including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others.
 The intense competition andthe rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors
in our operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of
 competition in this industry are:•
Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product style, design, innovation and development; as well as consumer price/value.•
Consumer connection, engagement and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing, promotion and digital experiences; social media interaction;customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, influencers, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse
our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics.
•
Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and on digital platforms.We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We strategically pursue available protections of these
rights and vigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement.
We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in
identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and
 Swoosh Design trademarks to be among ourmost valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we use in marketing our
products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and
 obtained trademarkregistrations.
We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. When appropriate, we also obtain registered copyrights.
We file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility and design patents protecting components,
 technologies, materials, manufacturing techniques, features,functionality, and industrial designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, athletic equipment and digital devices and related
software applications. These patents expire at various times.
We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing and is supported by our intellectual
property rights, such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets, among others.
We have followed a policy of applying for and registering intellectual property rights in the United States and select foreign countries on trademarks, inventions, innovations and
designs that we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and trade secrets against third-party
infringement.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
At NIKE, we consider the strength and effec
tive management of our workforce to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. We believe that it is important to attract,develop and retain a diverse and engaged workforce at all levels of our business and that such a workforce fosters creativity and accelerates innovation. We
 are focused onbuilding an increasingly diverse talent pipeline that reflects our consumers, athletes and the communities we serve.

Table of ContentsCULTURE
Each employee shapes NIKE’s culture through behaviors and practices. This starts with our Maxims, which represent our core values and, along with our Code of Conduct,
feature the fundamental behaviors that help anchor, inform and guide us and apply to all employees. Our mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete
 in theworld, which includes the belief that if you have a body, you are an athlete. We
 aim to do this by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, making our products moresustainably, building a creative and diverse global team and making a positive impact in communities where we live and work. Our mission is aligned with our deep
commitment to maintaining an environment where all NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to connect to our brands and
 to shape the culture inwhich they work. We believe providing for growth and retention of our employees is essential in fostering such a culture and are dedicated to giving access to training programs
and career development opportunities, including trainings on NIKE’s values, history and business, trainings on developing leadership skills at all levels, tools and resources for
managers and qualified tuition reimbursement opportunities.
As part of our commitment to empowering our employees to help shape our culture, we source employee feedback through our Engagement Survey program. The program
provides every employee throughout the globe an opportunity to provide confidential feedback on key areas known to drive employee engagement, including their satisfaction
with their managers, their work and the Company generally. The program also measures our employees’ emotional commitment to NIKE as well as NIKE’s culture of diversity,
equity and inclusion. NIKE also provides multiple points of contact for employees to speak up if they
 experience something that does not align with our values or otherwiseviolates our workplace policies, even if they are uncertain what they observed or heard is a violation of company policy.
As part of our commitment to make a positive impact on our communities, we have maintained a goal of investing 1.5% of
 our prior fiscal year’s pre-tax income into globalcommunities, with an emphasis on inspiring kids to be active through play and sport. We increased that annual goal to 2% for fiscal 2022 
forward. Our community investmentsare an important part of our culture in that we also support employees in giving back to community organizations through donations and volunteering, which are matched by
the NIKE Foundation where eligible.
EMPLOYEE BASE
As of May 31, 2021, we had approximately 73,300 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. We also utilize independent contractors and temporary
personnel to supplement our workforce.
None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the APLA geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a
trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States,
 local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information andconsultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into, and/or comply with,
industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.
DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION (DE&I)
DE&I is a strategic priority for NIKE and we are committed to having an increasingly diverse team and culture. We aim to fos
ter an inclusive workplace through recruitment,development and retention of diverse talent with the goal of expanding representation across all dimensions of diversity over the long term. In fiscal 2021,
 we elevated ourDE&I team to sit at the heart of
 NIKE’s People and Culture Strategy and combined our Talent and Diversity & Inclusion teams under a single leader. We also announcedcertain targets for the Company to work toward by fiscal 2025, including increasing representation of women in our global corporate workforce and leadership positions, as well
as increasing representation of U.S. racial and ethnic minorities in our U.S. corporate workforce and at the Director level and above.
We have enhanced our efforts to recruit diverse talent through our traditional channels and launched new initiatives, such as partnerships with athletes and sports-related
organizations to create apprenticeship programs and new partnerships with organizations, colleges and universities that serve diverse populations. Additionally, we are
prioritizing DE&I education so that all NIKE employees and leaders have the cultural awareness and understanding to build diverse and inclusive teams. We also have
Employee Networks, collectively known as NikeUNITED, representing various employee groups.
Our DE&I focus extends beyond our workforce and includes our communities, which we support in a number of ways. We have committed to
 investments through both theNIKE and Jordan Brands that aim to address racial inequality and improve diversity and representation in our communities. We also are leveraging our global scale to
accelerate business diversity, including investing in business training programs for women and increasing the proportion of services supplied by minority-owned businesses.

COVID-19 RESPONSE
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, NIKE has
 been, and continues to be, committed to supporting our employees and communities. Some of the ways NIKE respondedduring the pandemic to support employees include:
•
Throughout the pandemic NIKE has provided pay continuity for our retail, Air Manufacturing Innovation and distribution center employees—employees who wereparticularly affected by closures and reduced hours in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. We have also taken precautions to provide a safe
 working environment, encouragingand supporting work-from-home whenever possible and instituting protective policies and procedures for when remote work is not possible.
•
We provided a two-to-one match for all employee donations to community organizations providing COVID relief and support anywhere in the world.•
We offer two weeks of paid COVID-19 sick leave for all employees, in addition to existing paid time off benefits and legally mandated sick leave programs, which coversphysical health as well as mental and emotional well-being and care for a family member. We also provide the option for employees to utilize up to two weeks of paid time
off in advance of accrued balances, if needed.
•
As part of our holistic approach to support our employees in their wellness journey during quarantine mandates, we offered NTC Premium, the NIKE Training Club’ssubscription-based service, for free to our employees globally.
•
In addition to our existing EAP, we enhanced mental healthcare to include virtual care, access to insomnia and anxiety apps and increased EAP support.•
We also supported certain eligible employees who work from home due to COVID-19 health and safety measures by providing them with select technology and ergonomicproducts through a NIKE-exclusive portal.

Risk Factors
The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's
 business and financial performance.Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such
risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKE's business or the exten
t to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially fromthose contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a
prediction of actual results.
Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NI
KE's policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any
analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report.
 Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to theextent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not
 the responsibility of NIKE.Economic and Industry Risks
Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and
 could in the future be, adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic.A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a
2021 FORM 10-K 
10 
Table of Contentspandemic by the World Health Organization. To date, this pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the
 pandemic have caused, and may in the futurecause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets, both globally and in the United States
. These events have led toand could again lead to a decline in discretionary spending by consumers, and in turn materially impact, our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. We
cannot predict whether, and to what degree, our sales, operations and financial results could in the future be
 affected by the pandemic and preventative measures. Riskspresented by the COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to:
•
Deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and globally;•
Reduced consumer demand for our products if consumers seek to reduce or delay discretionary spending in response to the impacts of COVID-19, including as a result ofa rise in unemployment rates and diminished consumer confidence;
•
Cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and sporting events in multiple countries, including in the United States, and bans on large public gatherings, which havereduced consumer spending on our products and could impact the effectiveness of our arrangements with key endorsers;
•
Decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures, reduced operating hours, social distancing restrictions and/or changes in consumer behavior;•
The risk that any safety protocols in NIKE-owned or affiliated facilities, including our offices, will not be effective or not be perceived as effective, or that any virus-relatedillnesses will be linked or alleged to be linked to such facilities, whether accurate or not;
•
Incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements, including providing facial coverings and handsanitizer, rearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols, conducting temperature checks, COVID-19 testing and undertaking regular and thorough
disinfecting of surfaces;
•
Disruption to our distribution centers and our third-party manufacturing partners and other vendors, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operatinghours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and disinfection procedures;
•
Bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers, which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us, or result incancellation or reduction of their orders;
•
Operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, as a result of continued workforce remote work arrangements, and restrictions on employee travel;•
Impacts to our distribution and logistics providers' ability to operate or increases in their operating costs. These supply chain effects have had an adverse effect on ourability to meet consumer demand, including digital demand, and have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in an increase in our costs o
f production anddistribution, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses; and
•
Significant disruption of and volatility in global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future.We continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating, financial
and tax planning projections, including assumptions regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and the global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic. However, we
are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of 
the pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments. Inparticular, we believe the ultimate impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on, among other things, the further spread and
duration of COVID-19, the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of 
the illness, the availability, widespread distribution and acceptance, as well as the safety andefficacy of vaccines for COVID-19 and the economic impacts of the pandemic. Even
 in those regions where we have experienced business recovery, should those regions failto fully contain COVID-19 or suffer a COVID-19 relapse, those markets may not recover as quickly or at all, which could have a
 material adverse effect on our business andresults of operations. The pandemic may also affect our business, operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to
 us or that we currently do notconsider to present significant risks.
In addition, the impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A
. Risk Factors, any of which could have a material effect on us. 2021 FORM 10-K 
11 
Table of ContentsGlobal economic conditions could have a material
 adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world. If
 global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, the followingfactors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition:
•
Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Declines in consumer spending have in the past and in the future may result in reduced demand for ourproducts, increased inventories, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts and lower gross margins.
•
In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.•
We conduct transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility inthe markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial
condition.
•
Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleumderivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability.
•
If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this couldresult in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater
expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.
•
If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of ourproducts to consumers. If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the
 capital and creditmarkets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our
products.
Our products, services and experiences face intense competition.
NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends af
fect the demand for our products,services and experiences. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with
a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, private labels and large companies that
have diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent
manufacturers that produce our products. Our NIKE Direct operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers,
which sell our products through their digital platforms and physical stores, and with digital commerce platforms. In addition, we compete with respect to the digital services and
experiences we are able to offer our consumers, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content and
 services; and digital services and features in retailstores that enhance the consumer experience.
Product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service, digital
commerce platforms, digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition. These, in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology,
a reduction in barriers to the creation of new footwear and apparel companies and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, and
equipment, services and experiences, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of
 retail, including shifts in the ways in whichconsumers shop, and the continued proliferation of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations. If we do not adequa
telyand timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase, demand for our products may decline, possibly significantly, or we may need to reduce
wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products.
Economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global econom
ic environment, including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates, couldresult in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins
 and earnings.A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States
, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which createsexposure to the volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, there has been, and may continue
to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom's exit from the 
European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit” or new or proposed U.S. policychanges that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in
foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses
2021 FORM 10-K 
12 
Table of Contentscould be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as
weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by
 making their purchases of raw materialsmore expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an
 adverse effect on our results of operationsand financial condition.
We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effec
ts of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results.Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of
 a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reducethe positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the
 value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to theforeign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.
We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.
We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production
and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five 
to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. Theseadvance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with
economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse ef
fect on our sales, ourability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A
slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on
 our results ofoperations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers,
which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and
orders for our products. The ongoing financial uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, particularly for retailers, could also have an effect on our sales, our ability to collect on
receivables and our financial condition.
Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating
 results and financial condition.Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, manufacturers, customers, distribution centers, offices, headquarters and vendors are located
could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires and tsunamis, whether occurring in
the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects
, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past temporarily disrupted, andcould in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our vendors, manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the
 past resulted in, and in the future could result in,economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area
in which we or our suppliers, manufacturers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located, our continued success would depend, in part, on the safety
 andavailability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties' computer, network, telecommunication and other systems and operations. In
addition, a natural disaster or severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have
 an adverse impact onconsumer spending, any of which could in turn result in negative point-of-sale trends for our merchandise. Further, climate change may increase both the frequency and
severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, which may affect our business operations, either in a particular region or globally, as well as the activities of our
third-party vendors and other suppliers, manufacturers and customers. In addition, the physical changes prompted by climate change could result in changes in regulations or
consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We believe the diversity of locations in which we operate, our
operational size, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services
(“Information Technology Systems”) position us well, but may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities. If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or
other business continuity event or concurrent events, we could still experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect
our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel. For example, our World
Headquarters are located in an active seismic zone, which is at a higher risk for earthquakes and the related consequences or effects. Further,
 if we are unable to findalternative suppliers, replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our Information Technology Systems or supply systems, we
could be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers. These events could result in reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or markdowns,
all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Table of ContentsBusiness and Operational Risks
Failure to maintain our reputation, brand image and culture could
 negatively impact our business.Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and
growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment
to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and
reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a
 rapidly changing media environment,including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences. We could be
adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives.
Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity, purpose and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity
involving us, our culture and values, our products, services and experiences, consumer data, or any of our key employees, endorsers, sponsors or suppliers could seriously
damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. For example, while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business
in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not control their practices. Negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such
suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand. Further, our reputation and brand image could be damaged as a result of our support of,
association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct, or change,
 certain of our activities inresponse to such considerations. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to
negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in
us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If
 the reputation, culture or image of anyof our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, then our sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Our business is affected by seasonality, which could resu
lt in fluctuations in our operating results.We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the
second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time or in the future as a result of
 strategic shifts in our business,changes in COVID-19 related cancellations or postponements and seasonal or geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection
with the timing, cancellation or postponement of significant sporting events, such as the NBA
 Finals, Olympics or the World Cup, among others. In addition, our customers maycancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales.
Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our con
trol, includingeconomic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, outbreaks of disease, social or political unrest, availability of import quotas, transportation
disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to 
fluctuate. Our operating margins are alsosensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shif
ts in product sales mix and geographic salestrends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of 
the results to be expected for any future period.If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products,
 we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits.Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate,
 gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timelymanner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of
our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may no
t receive consumer acceptance as consumerpreferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of
 products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our abilityto anticipate and respond to these changes. If we 
fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing productofferings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we could experience lower
sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
 we market ourproducts globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If we
do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effec
t on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.

Table of ContentsWe rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our
 products.Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing processes of footwear, apparel and equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products.
Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital
technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment
managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to
 produce products that help to enhance athleticperformance and reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we
experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence.
Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could
 harm our business.We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, including artists, designers and influencers, to develop,
evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with
establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports
teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose 
the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we maybe required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed.
Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition,
 actionstaken or statements made by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products
 or brand that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams orleagues, or endorsers, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In
addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, public figures or sports organizations, to use and endorse our
products and brand or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect
our brand, sales and profitability.
Failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or 
inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins,reduced cash flows and harm to our business.
To meet anticipated demand for our products, we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we
hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer
demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on
our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we
require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages could delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and
consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our ne
t revenues and net income, and we areunlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.
Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue
 to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risksand uncertainties.
Our NIKE Direct operations, including our retail stores and digital platforms, have required and will continue to require significant investment. Our NIKE Direct stores have
required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease
commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to
integrate with our digital platforms. Because of their unique design and technological elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than
other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores, a
 decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortarretail, or the closure, temporary or otherwise, or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and
leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.
Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card 
fraud;mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation.
In addition, 
we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our NIKE Direct operations, and our digital offerings will require co
ntinued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms.  In order to deliver high-quality digital experiences, our digital platforms mustbe designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks, and standards that
 we do not control. We may not be successful2021 FORM 10-K 
15 
Table of Contentsin developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards. A
 growing portion of consumers access our NIKE Direct digitalplatforms, but in the event that it is more difficult for consumers to access
 and use our digital platforms, consumers find that our digital platforms do not effectively meet theirneeds or expectations or consumers choose not to access or use our digital platforms or use devices that do no
t offer access to our platforms, the success of our NIKE Directoperations could be adversely impacted. Our competitors may develop, or have already developed, digital experiences, features, content, services or technologies that are
similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance. 
We may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our NIKE Direct operations and management's attention from our other business opportunities could be
 diverted,which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
If the technology-based systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us onl
ine do not function effectively, our operating results, as well asour ability to grow our digital commerce business g
lobally or to retain our customer base, could be materially adversely affected.Many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms. Increasingly, consumers are using mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with
our competitors, and to do comparison shopping, as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on
 mobileplatforms. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience.
Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, secure, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery
options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our cus
tomers could place us at acompetitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our
digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, as use of our digital platforms continues to grow,
we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consumers' needs. If we fail to con
tinue to effectively scale and adapt our digitalplatforms to accommodate increased consumer demand, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital
experiences could decline.
Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience
through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well
as damage our reputation and brands.
We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, 
including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy orinterruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.
We are heavily dependent on Information Technology Systems, across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing,
transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities.
Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or
shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a 
timely basis depends significantly on the reliabilityof these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented Information Technology Sys
tems in all of the geographical regions in which weoperate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIK
E will continue to invest in these efforts.We cannot provide assurance, however, that the measures we take to secure and enhance 
these systems will be sufficient to protect our Information Technology Systems andprevent cyber-attacks, system failures or data or information loss. The failure of these systems to operate e
ffectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses,hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with
transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital
investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities, and may have an adverse effec
t on our reputation, results of operations andfinancial condition. In addition, the increased use of employee-owned devices for communications as well as work-from-home arrangements, such as those implemented in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, present additional operational risks to our Information Technology Systems, including, but not limited to, increased risks of cyber-attacks.
Further, like other companies in the retail industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue 
to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and otherattempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems. To da
te, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurancethat they will not have an impact in the future.
We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial
reporting, legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or 
those of ourvendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and

Table of Contentsprofits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce,
consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world
between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology
Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss o
f users.We are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or ma
intain the value of our brands.We currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to
successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships,
supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other
products.
We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protec
t our brands through approval rights over the design, productionprocesses, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by
our licensees. The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us.
Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may
 increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sellproducts.
The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many
stores and accelerating digital commerce capabilities. The market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions and construction of additional stores and
investments in digital capacity, and as a result of attrition as struggling retailers exit the market. Consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller set of
retailers, any of whom may experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, increasing market share
concentration among a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be
unable to find sufficient retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of
 sales and revenues.If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us
 or fail, we may incur significant losses.As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option
contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and o
ther investments on deposit or inaccounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As
 a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financialinstitutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If
 one of ourcounterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts
 with suchcounterparty, may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or 
failure of oneor more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products.
NIKE is supplied by 191 footwear factories located in 14 countries. We do not own or operate
 any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independentcontract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 2021,
 four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal2021 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 61% of NIKE Brand foo
twear production in fiscal 2021. Our ability to meet our customers' needsdepends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. I
f one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever theirrelationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade policies, or be unable to perform, including as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or
results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or o
therwise fail to deliver usproduct in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Certain of our manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product. Such manufacturing partners may go out of business if
 consumer preferencesor market conditions change such that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types o
f products they produce. If, in the future, the relevant products are again in demandand the specialized manufacturers no longer exist, we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain products in a timely manner or at all, which could
have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations.

Table of ContentsThe market for prime real estate is competitive.
Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, bo
th domestically and internationally, depends on the availability ofreal estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other 
factors. We also must be able to effectively renew ourexisting real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of
 our real estate locations, which may requiremodification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability
of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on
 our operating results and financial condition.Additionally, the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the
quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any
 adverse effect on the quality of thesedecisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing 
fleet of stores, which couldhave an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
The success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality emp
loyees, including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture andvalues.
Our success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the
 services of key individuals, orany negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit,
retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense
and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future o
ffice environments or adoption of a new work model that expectsemployees to work on-site for a specified number of days with some flexibility to work remotely on other days, may not meet the needs or expecta
tions of our employees ormay not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain our employees. In addition, shifts
in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States. W
e also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success, and we have invested substantial time and resources in building, maintaining and evolving our culture. Any failure
to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit employees.
Our business operations and financial performance could be adversely
 affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to United States orforeign employment regulations.
We have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor
standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which could have a
direct impact on our operating costs. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our
operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such
 increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs. There isalso a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment, health and safety, wage and hour laws, criminal activity, personal injury and
other claims. In addition, if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to
collective bargaining agreements, we could be vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Risks Related to Operating a Global Business
Our international operations involve inherent risks which
 could result in harm to our business.Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and
 the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States.Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer
preferences across geographic regions, political tensions, unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our
products are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the effect of Brexit, including implementation of the legal and regulatory framework that
applies to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union and other countries, as well as new and proposed changes affecting 
tax laws and trade policy inthe United States and elsewhere as further described below under 
“We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax  laws, additional tax liabilities or increasedvolatility in our effective tax rate”
 and “Changes to U.S. or other countries' trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.”
 Changes in the U.S. presidential administration's import and export policies, including trade restrictions, increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards or customs restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct
business and adversely affect our results of operations.
In addition, disease outbreaks, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These fac
tors,among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure
2021 FORM 10-K 
18 
Table of Contentsmaterials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of 
these or other factors make the conduct ofbusiness in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or
quotas that affect the cost and
 quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or soldmay eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of
currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of
 operations andfinancial condition.
Furthermore, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as the anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate. Although
 we implementpolicies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, suppliers and agents, as well as those companies to which we
outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an
 adverseeffect on our business, reputation and operating results.
Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and
 financing.The principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away
from the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal
materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and synthetic
fabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon 
theability of our independent contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE
 contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject towage rates and other labor standards that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of 
the countries in which our products are manufactured.There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not
 beable to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our independent contract manufacturers have experienced and
may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages or other changes in labor standards, whether government mandated or otherwise, and
increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals, fabrics or raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we
cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the
availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing
capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our
requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs
 asa result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality con
trol standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays,interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to
 meet retail customerand consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long-term.
Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large
geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure conges
tion or otherfactors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition,
manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such
 as air freight, which couldadversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs,
 so increases in the price of petroleum products canadversely affect our profit margins. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could also have a significant impact on
our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our reputation or results of operations.
Our success depends on our global distribution facilities.
We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the
 world. Our ability to meet customer expectations,manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our
distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in
shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities have in the past and could be interrupted by information technology problems, disasters such
as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or government actions taken to mitigate their spread. Any significant 
failure in our distribution facilities could result in anadverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us
 from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in ourdistribution facilities.

Table of ContentsLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks
We are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and
 litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.
As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the
United States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our employees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to comply with
any of these laws or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties tha
t could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition andresults of operations. Furthermore, laws, regulations and policies and the interpretation of such, can conflict among jurisdictions and compliance in one jurisdiction may result in
legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction. We are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our
business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, trademark rights
and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty
 the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the futureincur judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on
 our business, financial condition and results ofoperations and negatively impact our reputation. The global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade,
environmental, competition, privacy and other regulatory matters, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time,
which could adversely affect us. In addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the
 interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may result in significantunanticipated legal and reputational risks. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management's attention from our operations and result in
substantial legal fees.
Changes to U.S. or other countries' trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations
 or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a materialadverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions could impact our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In
particular, political and economic instability, geopolitical conflicts, political unrest, civil strife, terrorist activity, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation, nationalism and other
economic or political uncertainties in the United States or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations. 
Anynegative sentiment toward the United States as a result of any such
 changes could also adversely affect our business.In addition, changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our
products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business. U.S. presidential administrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the
negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S.,
 economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and othergovernment regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. 
It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter ourbusiness operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.
Changes or proposed changes in U.S. or other countries' trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. Tariffs and other changes
in U.S. trade policy have in the past and could in the future 
trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are consideringimposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. Further, any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the United States or in other countries could affec
t thetrade environment. The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the 
tradepolicies of the United States and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have
the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof or the
 economy of another country in which we conduct operations, our industry and the globaldemand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial condition and results of operations.Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.
We periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our
intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift
 of consumer preference away from ourproducts.
The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate 
to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable toprevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights.
We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-
consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, manufacturing,
use, importation and/or sale of certain products.
2021 FORM 10-K

Table of ContentsWe take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. These actions include contractual
measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential
information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not
always be effective. For example, confidential information related to business strategy, innovations, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results
or personal data could be prematurely, inadvertently, or improperly used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property rights, a decline in our
stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions.
In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the
 same extent as the laws of the United States. We may facesignificant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable 
to successfullyprotect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.
We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations
 or reputation.In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we handle transactional and personal information about our wholesale customers and consumers and
users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement, adaptive products and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data
thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering, such as phishing, and large-scale, complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods
of time. Any breach of our or our service providers' networks, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and 
financial data, misappropriation of ourconsumers', users' or employees' personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including
unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation; resulting in lost sales and consumers, fines, lawsuits, or
significant legal and remediation expenses. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach.
In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous, and sometimes conflicting, regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the
United States, Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data 
Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25,2018; and California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA") which became effective on January 1, 2020, and additional jurisdictions are considering
proposing or adopting similar regulations. These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual
privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process
enhancements called for under GDPR and CCPA) and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject
us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the
Company by governmental entities or others, imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on
revenues and profits.
We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax la
ws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate.We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to the
 tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Currenteconomic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.
Proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S.
corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted
 into law, could have anadverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows.
Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are under various tax holidays. We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements 
to obtain certainty in treatmentof certain tax matters. These holidays expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met, or 
terminated if certain conditions are not met. Theimpact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus po
tentially impacting our effective income tax rate. For example, in January 2019, theEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. If
this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and the Company's Netherlands
income taxes in the future could increase.
We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United S
tates Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood ofan adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate,
 thefinal determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related
disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the
2021 FORM 10-K 
21 
Table of Contentsapplicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions.
Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose
and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory 
tax rates.Failure of our contractors or our licensees' contractors to comply with our code
 of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business.We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to
 manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit independent parties tomanufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors tha
t directly manufacture our products and our licenseesthat make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, human rights,
health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require our contract manufac
turers and the contractors of our licensees to comply with applicable standards forproduct safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail
to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. If one or more of our direct or indirect contractors violates or fails to comply with, or is accused of
violating or failing to comply with, such standards and laws, this could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effec
t on oursales and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers,
manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales, force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of
additional regulations, including new or additional quotas, tariffs, sanctions, product safety regulations or other regulatory measures, by governmental authorities.
Risks Related to Our Securities, Investments and Liquidity
Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses
 and operations fail to produce expected returns.From time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses or capabilities, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of
existing businesses, such as our NIKE Direct operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effec
tive investments areessential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding
an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our 
financial results and divertmanagement attention from more profitable business operations. 
See also “ Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties
.” The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principa
l stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock.As of June 30, 2021, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned approximately 77% of our Class A Common Stock. 
If, on June 30, 2021, all of these shares were converted into Class BCommon Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 15%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the
requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of
 a substantialnumber of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock
. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to holdthe majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. Swoosh, LLC is controlled by Mr. Knight's son and NI
KE director, Travis Knight.Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquid
ity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.Our long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Inves
tors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for our existingfacilities or for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to credit or capital markets, could be adversely
affected. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that
 would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments,pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and
 enter into transactions with affiliates. Failureto comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the
 commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity ofamounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to
refinance existing debt.
If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adverse
ly affected.Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the
circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience
2021 FORM 10-K 
22 
Table of Contentsdifficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting polic
ies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated 
financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and onvarious other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of asse
ts, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenues andexpenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those
related to revenue recognition, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and
 definite-lived assets,hedge accounting for derivatives, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change
 or if actual circumstancesdiffer from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the
price of our Class B Common Stock.
Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our
 common stock.There are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to
deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute,
 afreeze-out statute, two classes of stock that
 vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directorsrounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our
company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market
price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company.
We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our
 stock to decline.Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include
information about our historical financial results as well as analysts' opinions of our future performance, which may, in part, be based upon any guidance we have provided.
Analysts' estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations. I
f our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts andinvestors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIK
E and other companies following a decline in the market priceof their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the 
future. Any litigation could result in reputational damage,substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources needed to successfully run our business.

IS OFFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and
apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations), to
retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our
shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth
by creating innovative, “must-have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital
platforms and at retail.
Since fiscal 2018, through the Consumer Direct Offense and our Triple Double strategy, we have focused on doubling the impact o
f innovation, increasing our speed and agilityto market and growing our direct connections with consumers. In June 2020, we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy:
Consumer Direct Acceleration. This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas. First, creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and
seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need. This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our owned stores, as well as
through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision. Second, we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct
focused on Men’s, Women’s and Kids'. This approach is intended to allow us to create product that
 better meets individual consumer needs, including more specialization ofour category approach, while re-aligning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities. In particular, we expect to reinvest in our Women’s and
Kids’ businesses and also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the Company to optimize effectiveness. Third, we will unify investments in data and analytics,
demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation. We believe
this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally. As such, our
new financial goals through fiscal 2025 are outlined below:
•
High single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth;•
Gross margin rate in the high 40s by fiscal 2025;•
Earnings before interest and taxes as a percent of revenues ("EBIT Margin") in the high teens by fiscal 2025;•
Mid to high teens diluted earnings per share growth;•
Exceeding low 30% range rate of return on invested capital (ROIC); and•
Annual capital expenditures at roughly 3% of Revenues.As a result of our strategic acceleration, management announced on July 22, 2020, a series of
 leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up ourexecution. These changes resulted in a net reduction of our global workforce and d
uring fiscal 2021, we incurred pre-tax charges of $294 million, which relate to employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. All related actions are now subs
tantially complete, and we expect future annual wage-related savings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy. 
For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 21 — Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
COVID-19 UPDATE
Throughout fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business results and operations globally. Our business and wholesale partners experienced temporary store
closures and stores operating on reduced hours, as a result of mandatory lockdowns across our North America, EMEA and APLA
 geographies. Additionally, disruption in theglobal supply chain due to container shortages, transportation delays and U.S. port congestion interrupted the 
flow of our inventory. Despite the disruption caused by thepandemic, we achieved record Revenues for fiscal 2021, which increased 19% to $44.5 billion, compared to the prior fiscal year, with gross margin expansion of 140 basis
points. We ended the fiscal year with Inventories down 7% compared to May 31, 2020, and
 our liquidity position remains strong with $13.5 billion of Cash and equivalents andShort-term investments, an increase of $4.7 billion compared to May 31, 2020.
Our NIKE Direct business fueled our growth throughout the year as we navigated the pandemic, leveraging our digital platforms with our store footprint to
 connect directly withthe consumer. NIKE Brand digital revenues grew 60% on a currency-neutral basis, with strong double-digit growth across each of our geographies. Despite temporary store
closures throughout the year, due to COVID-19 safety-related measures, we experienced a 4% increase in comparable store sales, driven by growth in Greater China and
North America, partially offset by declines in EMEA and APLA. As o
f July 15, 2021, approximately 99% of our owned stores were open with some operating on reduced hours.2021 FORM 10-K 
28 
Table of ContentsWe continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation, as well as guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities
and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating
plan. There remains risk that COVID-19 could have material adverse impacts on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability and may lead to higher than
normal inventory levels in various markets, adverse impacts on the global supply chain, revised payment terms with certain of our wholesale customers, higher sales-related
reserves, factory cancellation costs and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of
 earnings across our jurisdictions.FISCAL 2021 OVERVIEW
In fiscal 2021, NIKE, Inc. achieved record Revenues which increased 19% to $44.5 billion. The NIK
E Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, experiencedgrowth of 19%, up 17% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by increases across all geographies. NIKE Direct grew 30% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by 60% growth in
digital, with all geographies growing strong double digits, while wholesale revenues grew 10%. Revenues for Converse increased 19% and 16%, on a reported and currency-
neutral basis, respecti
vely,  led by strong double-digit growth in digital.Income (loss) before income taxes increased 131% for fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher revenues, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage.
NIKE, Inc. gross margin increased 140 basis points primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19 including lower factory cancellation charges, lower inventory
obsolescence reserves as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. The increase in gross margin also reflects
higher full-price product margins across wholesale and NIKE Direct. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower Demand creation expense, partially offset by
higher Operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail
operations, as well as lower sports marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed due to COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher digital marketing
investments. Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to an increase in strategic technology investments, higher NIKE Direct variable costs and $255 million in
restructuring-related costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and travel and related expenses. ROIC as of May 31
, 2021, was 48.8% compared to 21.5% as of May31, 2020. ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, see "Use of Non-GAA
P Financial Measures" for further information.During fiscal 2020, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and to shift to
 a distributor operatingmodel. During fiscal 2021, the transaction with Grupo SBF S.A. to
 purchase substantially all of our NIKE Brand operations in Brazil closed. Additionally, during the third quarterof fiscal 2021, we mutually agreed with Grupo Axo to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the
 transition of NIKE’s businesses in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to adistributor partnership. However, as we remain committed to selling the legal entities in all three countries and granting distribution rights to third-party distributors, the assets
and liabilities of the entities have remained classified as held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2021. For more information related to our planned
distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In futurequarters, as we shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor operating model within these countries, we expect consolidated NIKE, 
Inc. andAPLA revenue growth will be reduced due to differences in commercial terms. However, we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall
profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses, as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility.
While foreign currency markets remain volatile, in part due to geopolitical dynamics which may lead to a stronger U.S. Dollar, we continue to see opportunities to drive future
growth and profitability. We remain committed to effectively managing our business and mitigating financial market risks to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by
executing against the operational strategies outlined above.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues,
Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Total NI
KE, Inc. EBIT, as well as EBIT Margin and ROIC, which should be considered in addition to, and not inlieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAA
P”).References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of
 our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKEBrand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations,
which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates
in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations. EBIT is calculated as Net Income before 
Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. EBITMargin
2021 FORM 10-K 
29 
Table of Contentsis calculated as EBIT divided by total NIKE Inc. Revenues.
 ROIC represents a performance measure that management believes is useful information in understanding theCompany's ability to effectively manage invested capital, see the table below for how the Company calculates this measure.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally,
management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying
business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, ROIC and EBIT should not be considered in isolation or
as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAA
P and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures usedby other companies.

Table of ContentsFISCAL 2021 NIKE BRAND REVENUE HIGHLIGHTS
The following tables present NIKE Brand revenues disaggregated by reportable operating segment, distribution channel and major product line:
FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020
On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues increased 17% for fiscal 2021, driven by growth in both 
the NIKE Brand and Converse. Higher revenues in North Americacontributed approximately 7 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, with EME
A and Greater China each contributing approximately 4 percentage points of growth andAPLA and Converse each contributing approximately 1 percentage point of growth.
On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2021, driven by growth in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear and the Jordan
Brand. Unit sales of footwear increased 11%, while higher average selling price (ASP), on a wholesale equivalent basis, per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points
of footwear revenue growth. The increase in ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts, as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP and
 thefavorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.
Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2021, due to growth in all key categories, primarily Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and the Jordan
Brand. Unit sales of apparel increased 14%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP
 wasprimarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP, partially offset by
 lower full-price ASP.On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 39% of our total NIKE Brand revenues 
for fiscal 2021 compared to 35% for fiscal 2020. Digitalcommerce sales were $9.1 billion for fiscal 2021 compared to $5.5 billion for fiscal 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 30% for fiscal 2021,
driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 60%, comparable store sales growth of 4% and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude digital
commerce sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open
at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15%
 within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year.Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a
performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory
stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry.
As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2021 NIKE Brand Men's and Women's revenues increased 11% and 20%, respectively. Higher NIKE Brand Men's revenues were driven by
growth in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Football (Soccer). Higher NIKE Brand Women's revenues were driven by growth in all key
categories, primarily Sportswear, the Jordan Brand, Training and Running. Revenues for our NIKE Kids' business increased 15%, due to growth primarily in the Jordan Brand
and Football (Soccer).

Table of ContentsGROSS MARGIN
FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020
For fiscal 2021, our consolidated gross profit increased 23% to $19,962 million compared to $16,241 million for fiscal 2020, as the prior fiscal year was significantly impacted
by lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures within our NIKE Direct operations due to COVID-19. Gross margin increased 140 basis points to 44.8% for
fiscal 2021 compared to 43.4% for fiscal 2020 due to the following:
*Wholesale equivalent
Favorable NIKE Brand full-price product margins across both our wholesale and NIKE Direct businesses primarily reflect higher full-price ASP, net of discounts. Additionally,
the favorable impact of growth in our higher margin NIKE Direct business, led by NIKE owned Digital, was more than offset by higher promotions in our factory s
tores duringthe first half of fiscal 2021 to reduce excess inventory as a result of
 COVID-19. Lower other costs are due to annualizing certain impacts of COVID-19 from fiscal 2020,including lower factory cancellation charges, lower inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of
wholesale shipments.

Demand creation expense c onsists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand eventsand retail brand presentation.
FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020
Demand creation expense decreased 13% for fiscal 2021, due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail operations, as well as lower sports
marketing expense as sporting events were postponed due to COVID-19. This activity was partially offset by higher digital marketing investments. Changes in foreign currency
exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2021.
Operating overhead expense increased 4% for fiscal 2021, due to an increase in strategic technology investments, higher NIKE
 Direct variable costs, and approximately $255million in restructuring-related costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and related expenses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased
Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2021.

Table of ContentsFISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020
Other (income) expense, net decreased from $139 million of other expense, net in fiscal 2020 to $14 million of other expense, net
 in the current year, primarily due to the non-recurring impairment charge of $405 million incurred in the prior year associated with our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA, partially offset by a
$241 million net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges.
For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses, and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-
related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $19 million for fiscal 2021.

Our effective tax rate was 14.0% for fiscal 2021, compared to 12
.1% for fiscal 2020 due to a change in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. related to the recovery fromthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and less favorable impacts from discrete items such as stock-based compensation.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
Our operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE 
Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operationsparticipating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic foo
twear, apparel and equipment.The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & 
Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America(APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands, with results for the
 Hurley brand, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, included in North America. Refer to Note 20— Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company's NIKE Direct operations
are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company and operates predominately in one industry: the
design, marketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories.
As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand
entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the fu
ture selling seasons to which theyrelate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons)
based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. 
Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments andConverse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the en
tity's functional currency. Differences between assignedstandard foreign currency exchange rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our
centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

$ 5,089  $2,899  76  %$ 3,925  -26  %We believe there continues to be a meaningful shift in the way consumers shop for product and make purchasing decisions across each of our geographies. Consumers are
demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expecta
tion for superior service and rapid delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital and mono-brand experiences in NIKE Direct. We anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical
channels. Specifically in North America, we remain focused on building long-term momentum with our strategic wholesale customers, which offer a differentiated retail
experience. Additionally, over the last three years we have significantly reduced the number of undifferentiated wholesale accounts. During fiscal 2021, we took further s
tepstowards account and channel consolidation by reprioritizing product allocation to benefit NIKE Direct and our differentiated strategic wholesale customers. We expect that over
the next two fiscal years, we will more aggressively accelerate these changes as we work to reprofile the shape of the marketplace and recapture wholesale revenue declines
over time.
FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020
On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues increased 19%, driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. NIKE Direct
revenues increased 37%, driven by strong digital sales growth of 73%, comparable store sales growth of 5% and the addition of new stores.
Footwear revenues increased 25% on a currency-neutral basis due to higher revenues in several key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of
footwear increased 17%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher
NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs, in part reflecting lower-discounts, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.
On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2021 driven by growth in all key categories, led by Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 8%, while
ASP per unit was flat, as the favorable impact of growth in our NI
KE Direct business was offset by lower full-price ASP.Reported EBIT increased 76% driven by higher revenues, lower selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues and gross margin expansion. Gross margin
increased approximately 430 basis points, primarily due to lower other costs, higher full-price ASP, reflecting lower discounts, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct
business and lower product costs. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19 from fiscal 2020, including lower factory cancellation
charges, lower inventory obsolescence reserves and the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. Selling and
administrative expense decreased due to lower operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily as a result of lower bad
debt and wage-related expenses, partially offset by higher NIKE Direct variable costs. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to lower advertising and
marketing expense for brand events and our retail operations, as well as lower sports marketing expense, partially offset by continued investments in digital marketing to
support heightened digital demand.

On a currency-neutral basis, EMEA revenues for fiscal 2021 grew 17%, driven by higher revenues across nearly all territories, led by UK & Ireland and Central Europe, which
grew 34% and 20%, respectively. Revenues increased in all key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. NIKE Direct revenues increased 25%, driven by strong
digital sales growth of 67%, partially offset by a 10% decline in comparable store sales, primarily 
due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from temporary store closures and safety-related measures in response to COVID-19
. Currency-neutral footwear revenues increased 13%, driven by higher revenues in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear
increased 9% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points, resulting from higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE
Direct business.
Currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 25% due to growth in all key categories, led by Sportswear and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel increased 26%, while
lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to a lower mix of NIKE Direct sales, partially offset
by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts.
Reported EBIT increased 58% as higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased
approximately 110 basis points primarily due to lower NIKE Direct margins and unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset lower
product costs and lower other costs. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19, including lower inventory obsolescence reserves,
as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower
demand creation and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily driven by lower retail brand presentation costs and lower sports
marketing expense. Lower operating overhead expense was primarily due to lower bad debt and travel and related expenses, partially offset by higher NIKE Direct variable
costs.

Currency-neutral apparel revenue growth of 19% was fueled by higher revenues in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 18%,
while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was driven by higher off-price ASP, partially offset
 by lowerNIKE Direct ASP due to higher levels of promotion to liquidate excess inventory through our factory s

approximately 200 basis points primarily due to unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense
decreased due to lower demand creation expense, partially offset by higher operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower
advertising and marketing, as well as digital marketing expenses. Growth in operating overhead expense was driven by higher investments within our NIKE Direct operations.

Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020
On a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2021. The increase was due to higher revenues across most territories, led by a 15% increase in Japan,
 a37% increase in Pacific, which includes Australia and New Zealand, and a 12% increase in Korea, partially offset by a decline in Latin Distributors of 48%. Additionally, the
transition of our NIKE Brand business in Brazil to a third-party distributor operating model reduced APLA revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points. Revenues
increased in most key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. NIKE Direct revenues increased 22%, primarily fueled by strong digital sales growth of 73%,
partially offset by comparable store sales declines of 4%, largely due to 
reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 . Currency-neutral footwear revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2021 due to higher revenues in several key categories, primarily the Jordan Brand and Sportswear. Unit sales of
footwear decreased 5%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct
ASPs, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory, which includes Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE
 Directbusiness.
Currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 10% for fiscal 2021 due to higher revenues in most key categories, led by Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 5%, while
higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher full-price ASP, in part
reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.
Reported EBIT increased 29% for fiscal 2021 driven by higher revenues, lower selling and administrative expense and gross margin expansion. Gross margin increased
approximately 130 basis points as higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory, and lower other costs,
 were partiallyoffset by higher product costs, unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and lower margin in our NIKE Direct business. The decrease in other costs
 was primarilydue to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19, including lower factory cancellation charges and lower inventory obsolescence reserves. Selling and administrative expense
decreased due to lower demand creation and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing
expense, as well as a decline in sports marketing costs. Lower operating overhead expense was primarily due to lower bad debt and travel and related costs, partially offset by
higher NIKE Direct variable costs.

On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2021
. The increase in revenues was driven by revenue growth across Western Europe, North America and Asia. Wholesale revenues increased 13%, driven primarily by growth in Western Europe and Asia, in part due to the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year. Direct
to consumer revenues increased 24%, driven by strong digital sales growth across North America and Western Europe. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to
consumer channels increased 9%, while ASP increased 8%, primarily due to growth in full-price sales, including through our digital channel.
Reported EBIT increased 83%
, driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense. Gross margin was flat, as higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, and the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments was offset by higher product cos
ts and unfavorable changes in standardforeign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense
decreased primarily due to lower bad debt, travel and related costs and other administrative costs. Demand creation expense decreased as a result of lower advertising and
marketing, as well as digital marketing expenses.

liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments.
FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020
Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $294 million during fiscal 2021, primarily due to the following:
•
an unfavorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $241 million related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net;
•
a favorable change of $132 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned tothe NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses;
 these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin;and
•
an unfavorable change of $185 million in part due to restructuring-related costs of $294 million associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July2020, partially offset by the $405 million charge in the prior year related to our planned distributor transition within APLA.
For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA, as well as more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, refer
to Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 21 — Restructuring, respectively, within the accompanying Notes to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements.FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES
OVERVIEW
As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed 
to risk arising from changes in currency exchangerates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency
denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.
Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of
 currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations,financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We
 manage theseexposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of 
the remainingexposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign
currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our
portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes
 on the underlying net exposuresbeing hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of
 exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; thelength of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for 
trading or speculative purposes.Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
foradditional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.
2021 FORM 10-K 
42 
Table of ContentsTRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES
We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:
•
Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.
Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: a.
Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE
 entities in their respective functional currencies. NTCsales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the
 NTC.b.
Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.
2.
Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under
this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the baske
t of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor,materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.
For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, 
the currency rate fluctuation affecting the productcost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the
U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through 
Other (income)expense, net. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of 
the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollaragainst the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against
the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.
•
Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned incurrencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a
 subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreigncurrency exposure.
•
Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certaincases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at
fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the
 Consolidated FinancialStatements for additional detail.
•
Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables,including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to
remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.
MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES
Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural
offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts
 to hedge the remaining effect of exchange ratefluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described
above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except 
for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and othercontractual agreements.
2021 FORM 10-K 
43 
Table of ContentsCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to
remeasurement, and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are
recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of 
the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominatedasset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged.
TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES
Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as
we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of 
foreignsubsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional
currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the
translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately $893 million, a detriment of approximately $867 million and a detriment of approximately $1,236
million for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate 
fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxeswas a benefit of approximately $260 million, a detriment of approximately $212 million and a detriment of approximately $233 million for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020
and 2019, respectively.
Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Management has
concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019,
the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and
 for the period ended May 31, 2021, this change did not have amaterial impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates.
MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES
To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess
cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these
U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S.
GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the
 forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination ofthe purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the
 effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact onnet earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S
. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related
gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact of approximately $19 million and unfavorable impacts of $91 million and $97 million on our
Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019
, respectively.NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES
We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the
U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of fu
ture repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged andmay, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effec
ts of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. Thesehedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. G
AAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2021 and 2020. Therewere no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2021
, 2020 and 2019.2021 FORM 10-K

Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
CASH FLOW ACTIVITY
Cash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $6,657 million for fiscal 2021 compared to $2,485 million for fiscal 2020. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items,
generated $6,612 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2021 compared to $3,730 million for fiscal 2020. The increase primarily reflects the recovery of our business
operations from the impact of COVID-19. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided (used) by operations of
$45 million for fiscal 2021, compared to a decrease of $1,245 million for fiscal 2020. The net change in working capital was impacted by a $2,361 million decrease in
Inventories, driven by strong consumer demand as we return to healthy inventory levels across markets closed in the prior year due to COVID-19. An increase in Accounts
Payable and Accrued Liabilities also contributed to the net change in working capital, primarily due to reduced spending in fiscal 2020 as a result of COVID-19. In
 addition, thenet change in working capital was impacted by a $2,845 million increase in Accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $3,800 million for fiscal 2021, compared to an outflow of $1,028 million for fiscal 2020, primarily driven by higher
purchases of short-term investments. During fiscal 2021, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $3,276 million
compared to a cash inflow of $27 million in fiscal 2020. Additionally, during fiscal 2021, we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically
focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain. In future periods, we expect to
make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3% of annual revenues.
Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $1,459 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an inflow of $2,491 million for fiscal 2020. This change was primarily
due to the net proceeds from a $5,942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2020, partially offset by lower share repurchases during fiscal 2021.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, we elected to
 temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existingshare repurchase program. The existing program remained authorized by the Board of Directors and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we began repurchasing shares
under the program. In fiscal 2021, we purchased 4.9 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $650 million (an average price of $133.54 per share) under the four-
year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2021, we had repurchased 50.0 million shares at a cost
 of $4,669million (an average price of $93.33 per share) under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash.
The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
On July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the U.S
. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amountof debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022.
On August 16, 2019, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate
 of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option toincrease borrowings up to $3 billion in total upon lender approval. The facility matures on August 16, 2024, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the
closing date, provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond August
 16, 2026. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on August28, 2015, which would have matured August 28, 2020. On March 15, 2021
, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides forup to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total upon lender approval. The facility matures on March 14, 2022, with a 364-day
extension option up to 30 days prior to the existing termination date, provided that in no
 event shall the facility extend beyond March 13, 2023. This facility replaces the prior $2billion credit facility agreement entered into on April 6, 2020, which would have matured on April 5, 2021. As of May 31, 2021 and
 2020, no amounts were outstanding underour committed credit facilities. Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.
We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor 
Services, respectively. As it relates to our committedcredit facilities entered into on August 16, 2019 and March 15, 2021, if our long-term debt ratings were to
 decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase.Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger
acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to various
covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of deb
t secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowingsoutstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a
 waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become2021 FORM 10-K 
45 
Table of Contentsimmediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2021, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of
 these covenantsin the foreseeable future.
Liquidity was also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program, which we decreased from $4 billion in connection with the new credit facility agreement, entered into
on March 15, 2021, as described above. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $248
million. No commercial paper was outstanding as of May 31, 2021. As of May 31, 2020, we had $248 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest
rate of 1.65%.
We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and 
P1 fromStandard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.
To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs
 associated with issuingcommercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.
As of May 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments 
totaling $13.5 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits heldat major banks, money market funds, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our
fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities
have varying durations, as of May 31, 2021, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash
 equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 54 days.We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, toge
ther with access to external sources of funds as describedabove, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.
We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We
 indefinitely reinvest asignificant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. 
Should we require additional capital in the UnitedStates, we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through deb
t. Given our existing structure, if we were torepatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues
that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated
probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.

over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(3)
We generally order product at l east four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumeroperations. The amounts listed f
or product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable andlegally binding and specify 
all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.(4)
Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course ofbusiness. The amounts represe

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Refer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accountingstandards.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make es
timates andjudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 — Summary ofSignificant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the
preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the
Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.
These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements as of a given date. Because
 of the uncertainty inherent in thesematters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of
 these critical accounting policies, we are notcurrently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Beginning in fiscal 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Our revenue recognition policies
under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs.
Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as
 well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation,which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. We satisfy 
the performance obligation and record revenues whentransfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of
 sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive2021 FORM 10-K 
47 
Table of Contentssubstantially all of the benefits of the product. Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on 
the country of the sale and theagreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to
 substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transactionprice is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale
transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by
 the wholesalecustomer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.
As part of our revenue recognition policy, consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and
miscellaneous claims from customers. We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an
offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product
 returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and othercurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of
both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later da
te.Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from
customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet 
finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts andclaims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different
than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made.
Refer
 also  to  Note  1  —  Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies  and  Note  16  —  Revenues  for  additional  information  in  the  accompanying  Notes  to  the  ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.
INVENTORY RESERVES
We make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
If we estimate the netrealizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the
 difference between the cost of the inventory andthe estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions 
to the estimated net realizablevalue of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. 
CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS
A significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments
 are expensed on a straight-linebasis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted 
for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation
expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.
Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a
specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period
based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances,
 to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in theendorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.
Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which we record in Cost of sales as the related
sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of tha
t earned through sales ofproduct within Demand creation expense.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent
 or manner in which an asset isused, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect 
the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of anasset, among others. If such facts indicate a po
tential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset2021 FORM 10-K 
48 
Table of Contentsgroup by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted
 cash flows expected to result from the use and eventualdisposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If
 the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is notrecoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any
impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES
We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and
liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts
 hedging probable forecasted future cash flows arerecorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in
gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One
of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of
 these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions.By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual 
transactions. When the designated amount ofanticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period
or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge
contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circumstances, the
additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of
 the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.INCOME TAXES
We are subject to taxation in the United States, as
 well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significantjudgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. 
On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. Thisestimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income be
fore income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects o
f infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, wecontinually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our
expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When 
this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent
on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our de
ferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxableincome. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset
, which increases our Income tax expense inthe period when such determination is made.
We have not recorded withholding tax expense for foreign earnings we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested within certain of our foreign jurisdictions. The amount of
earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore is due to the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore operations and our expectations o
f the future cash needs of our U.S.and foreign entities. Withholding tax consequences are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested of
fshore.We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the
presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination is based on expected working capital and other capital needs in jurisdictions where the earnings
are generated, the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs o
f our U.S. operationsmay exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less 
than our current expectations. This would result in additional withholding taxexpense in the year we determined amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore.
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the
 amount recognized for uncertain tax positions basedon factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit ac
tivity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognitionof a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes
. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Incometax expense.

Table of ContentsOTHER CONTINGENCIES
In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a
variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the
 loss is reasonablyestimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of
third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If
future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in
which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a
reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not
believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALIT
ATIVE DISCLOSURESABOUT MARKET RISK
In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in
the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such
exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.
We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management
program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctua
tions on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Weuse forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not ye
t firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables andpayables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future,
 also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in thenet assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in 
those subsidiaries. Where exposures arehedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate
 movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon 
thenature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12
 to 24 months in advance of the forecastedtransaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the
 forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31,2021, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.
S. Dollarcurrency pairs. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of
interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and
fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.
MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT
We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-
Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany loans
denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.
We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum
potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95%
confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on
 interrelationships between currencies andinterest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the
preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the po
tentialloss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency
rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate
 fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipatedtransactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.
The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of
 favorable changes inmarket rates. It also does not represent the full extent o
f the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes ordifferences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $92 million and $48
million as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2021. Such a
hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the
 underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in thefair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $184 million and $126 million during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.
2021 FORM 10-K 
51 
Table of ContentsThe instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Intercompany
loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign
exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate
 and foreign currency market risksassociated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) -
15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
 amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
, in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect
 on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of
 the effectiveness of ourinternal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
May 31, 2021.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NIKE, Inc
. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidatedstatements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of
 the three years in the period ended May 31, 2021, including the relatednotes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have
audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2021, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as o
f May 31, 2021 and2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each o
f the three years in the period ended May 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effec
tive internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,2021, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the COSO. Changes in Accounting Principles
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed 
the manner in which it accounts for leases as of June 1, 2019 and the manner in whichit accounts for revenue from contracts with customers and the manner in which it accounts for income taxes related to
 intra-entity transfers other than inventory as of June 1,2018.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
 independentwith respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
 Commission and thePCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAO
B. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance aboutwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effec
tive internal control over financial reportingwas maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated 
financial statements,whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating ef
fectiveness of internalcontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control
 over Financial ReportingA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
 the assets ofthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
 thecompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated 
financial statements and (ii) involved our especiallychallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the
 accounts or disclosures towhich it relates.
Accounting for Income Taxes
As described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the
 Company recorded income tax expense of $934 million for the year ended May 31, 2021, and hasnet deferred tax assets of $1,133 million, including a valuation allowance of $12 million, and total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, of
$896 million as of May 31, 2021, $609 million of which would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized in fu
ture periods. The realization of deferred tax assets isdependent on future taxable earnings. Management assesses the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and available tax planning
strategies and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization. A valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset 
to theextent that recovery is not likely. The Company is subject to taxation in the United 
States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. As disclosed by management, theuse of significant judgment and estimates, as well as the interpretation and application of complex tax laws is required by management to determine the Company's provision
for income taxes.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for income taxes is a critical audit matter are the high degree of auditor
judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to (i) management's assessment of complex tax laws and regulations,
including recent court rulings, as it relates to determining the provision for income taxes and other tax positions, and (ii) management's assessment of realizability of deferred
tax assets, specifically around future taxable income, foreign tax credit utilization and available tax planning strategies. In addition, the
 audit effort involved the use ofprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matters involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the provision for income taxes and other 
tax positions, including controls over management'sassessments of the realizability of deferred tax assets. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the ef
fect on the Company's tax provision of changes in itslegal entity structure, evaluating changes in and compliance with tax laws, and testing management's tax calculations including the Company's forecast of fu
ture taxableincome, tax planning strategies, and foreign tax credit utilization of deferred tax assets. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the
application of relevant tax laws, the provision for income taxes and the reasonableness of management's assessments of whether certain tax
 positions are more-likely-than-notof being sustained.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
NIKE, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE, Inc.
portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, and Converse. The NIK
E Brand is focused on performance athleticfootwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across a wide range of sport categories, amplified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh trademark,
as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual foo
twear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales andoperating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. Sales and operating results of
 Hurley brandproducts, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, were reported within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment. Refer to Note 20 —
 Acquisitions andDivestitures for information regarding the divestiture of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley. Converse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers,
apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets ou
tside the U.S., thesetrademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc.
 and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "NIKE"). All significant intercompany transactions andbalances have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Beginning in fiscal 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The Company's
revenue recognition policies under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs.
Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as
 well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation,which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records
revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of
 sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use andreceive substantially all of the benefits of the product.
Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the
 customer. Control transfers toretail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales
price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or
agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the
 time of salefor retail store and digital commerce transactions.
Consideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the associated revenues are recognized over the
license period.
Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a
customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
 Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight aftercontrol over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of
 sales when the related revenues are recognized.SALES-RELATED RESERVES
Consideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from
customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offset
ting increaseto Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current asse
ts on theConsolidated Balance Sheets.
The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of
both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later da
te.2021 FORM 10-K 
63 
Table of ContentsEstimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from
customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet 
finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts andclaims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts
 or claims are significantlygreater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net Revenues is recorded in the period in which such determination is made.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge
gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales.
DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE
Demand creation expense
 consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary products, television, digital and printadvertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run.
 Advertising mediacosts are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the
 event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation areexpensed when the presentation is complete and delivered.
A significant amount of the Company's promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on
 astraight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contracts contain elements that may be accoun
ted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances ofeach individual contract. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending
on the period to which the prepayment applies.
Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records
Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.
Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a
specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in
 Demand creation expense ratably over thecontract period based on the Company's best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these
 instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from theCompany's estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.
Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which the Company records in Cost of sales
as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess
 of thatearned through sales of product within Demand creation expense.
Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Company's products. The Company records
these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time it is obligated to its cus
tomers for the costs. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run.Total advertising and promotion expenses, which the Company refers to as Demand creation expense, were $3,114 million, $3,592 million and $3,753 million for the years
ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $630 million and $686 million at May 31, 2021 and 2020,
 respectively,of which $338 million and $326 million, respectively, were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $292 million and $360 million, respectively, were
recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepayment applied.
OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE
Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, bad debt expense as well as other administrative
expenses such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, meetings and travel.

Table of ContentsCASH AND EQUIVALENTS
Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near 
their maturity theypresent insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market 
funds, timedeposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of
 purchase.SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, time deposits and corporate debt securities with
maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. At May 31
, 2021 and 2020, Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fairvalue with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), unless unrealized losses are determined to be unrecoverable.
Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with
maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at
 thedate of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company's Short-term investments.
ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Accounts receivable, net
 consist primarily of amounts due from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable andmaintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of
significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and industry trends, such as the
impacts of COVID–19, to determine the amount of the allowance. Accoun
ts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet dateand related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $93
million and $214 million as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
INVENTORY VALUATION
Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value, and valued on either an average or a specific identification cos
t basis. In some instances, the Company shipsproducts directly from its suppliers to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. 
Inventory costs primarily consist ofproduct cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and other handling fees.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to
40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.
Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization of all other
assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2- to 12-year period on a straight-line basis. The
Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. The Company also capitalizes
certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with
respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other
post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.
Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject
 to capitalization beginning when a product'stechnological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are
released soon after technological feasibility has been established; therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are
usually not significant, and generally, most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

Table of ContentsIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate
 an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner inwhich an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affec
t the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observablemarket value of an asset, among others. If such fac
ts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if thecarrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash 
flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over theremaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the
 carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Companywill estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment
would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or
circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Even
ts orchanges in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting
unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other fac
tors.For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company allocates goodwill across its reporting units, which are considered the Company's operating segments. The
Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
 reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, afterassessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that
 the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount,an impairment test is unnecessary. If an impairment test is necessary, the Company will estimate the fair value of its related reporting units. I
f the carrying value of a reportingunit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the
excess of the carrying value over the related fair value.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is
more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of even
ts and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likelythan not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a
 quantitative fair value measurement calculation isrequired for these intangible assets, the Company primarily utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent
their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the 
future revenues for the relatedbrands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. If
 the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible exceeds its fair value, the asset isdetermined to be impaired, and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value.
OPERATING LEASES
Beginning in fiscal 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842) . Periods prior to fiscal 2020 have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historical accounting policies. The Company's lease recognition policies under Topic 842 are described in the
following paragraphs.
The Company primarily leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other non-real estate assets. The Company
determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at the commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes
possession of or controls the physical use of the asset. Lease components are no
t separated from nonlease components for real estate leases within the Company's leaseportfolio. Right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term with lease expense recognized on a
straight-line basis. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable.
Lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances.
ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced by the amount of lease incentives. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the
 leaseand options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. The Company does not record leases with an initial term of
12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and recognizes related lease payments in the Consolidated Sta
tements of Income on a straight-line basis over thelease term. Certain lease agreements include variable lease

Table of Contentspayments, which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or adjust periodically for inflation as a result of changes in a published index, primarily the
Consumer Price Index, and are expensed as incurred.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, equity securities and available-for-sale debt securities.
Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The
Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs
used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach).
The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
•
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities inactive markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to 
the asset orliability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs
without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals,
volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing
curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties.
The Company's fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.
Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a
component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Total shareholders' equity.
The Company's global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their
functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other (income) expense, net, within the Consolidated
Statements of Income.
ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair
value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) (a component of Total shareholders' equity), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally
designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent
 to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the samecategory as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash
 flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash provided by operationscomponent of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment
 hedges, this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of theConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the Company's fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the
 change in fair value of its fixed-rate debtattributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component o
f theConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company's risk management program and
derivatives.

Table of ContentsSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value, net of estimated 
forfeitures, of equity awards and recognizing the related expense as Costof sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, in the Consolidated Statements of Income on
 a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Substantially all awards vestratably over four years of continued employment, with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant.
 The fair value of options, stock appreciation rights and employees'purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted
stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant.
Refer to Note 11 — Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for additional information on the Company's stock-based compensation programs.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
 liabilities for the expectedfuture tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax
 basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance toreduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of deferred tax asse
ts is dependent on future taxableearnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The Company uses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this
assessment of realization, which are inherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results. To the extent the
 Company believes thatrecovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset, which increases the Company’s income tax expense in the period when such
determination is made.
The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the
 position will be sustained uponexamination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.
Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes for further discussion.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per
common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.
Refer to Note 12 — Earnings Per Share for further discussion.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reportedamounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, the
 extent to which the evolving COVID-19pandemic impacts the Company's financial statements will depend on a number of factors, including the magnitude and duration of the pandemic. There remains risk that
COVID-19 could have a material, adverse impact on future revenue growth as well as overall profitability and may lead to higher than normal inventory levels in various
markets, adverse impacts on the global supply chain, revised payment terms with certain wholesale customers, higher sales-related reserves, factory cancellation costs and a
volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across the Company's jurisdictions.
RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In October 2016, the FASB issued A
SU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than  Inventory. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset o
ther than inventory when the transfer occurs. Income tax effects of intra-entitytransfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The
 Company adopted the standard on June 1, 2018, using a modifiedretrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of applying the new standard recognized in Retained earnings at the date
 of adoption. The adoption resulted in reductionsto Retained earnings

Table of ContentsThe Company records the assets and liabilities of its derivative financial instruments on a gross basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's derivative financial
instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of
 assets and liabilities in the event of default or early termination of the contract. Any amountsof cash collateral received related to these instruments associated with the Company's credit-related contingent features are recorded in Cash and equivalents and Accrued
liabilities, the latter of which would further offset against the Company's derivative asset balance. Any amounts of
 cash collateral posted related to these instrumentsassociated with the Company's credit-related contingent features are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, which would further offset against 
the Company'sderivative liability balance. Cash collateral received or posted related to the Company's credit-related contingent features is presented in the Cash provided by operations

As of May 31, 2021 and 2020, long-term income taxes payable were $640 million and $757 million, respectively, and were included within Deferred income taxes and other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state
 and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for fiscal years2017 through 2019. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2016, with the
 exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. Tax years after2010 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in
the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates tha
t it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits coulddecrease by up to $40 million within the next 12 months. In January 2019, the 
European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands hasbreached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If 
this matter is adversely resolved, theNetherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods, and the Company's Netherlands income taxes in the future could
increase.
The Company historically provided for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the
United States. As a result of the enactment
 of the Tax Act, in fiscal 2018 the Company reevaluated its historic indefinite reinvestment assertion and determined that anyhistorical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Effective January 1, 2020, however, the tax law in the
Netherlands, one of the Company's major jurisdictions, changed. As a result of the change in law, the Company's undistributed earnings in the Netherlands are subject to
withholding tax upon distribution. It is the Company's intention to indefinitely reinvest the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries outside North America prior to
May 31, 2020, to ensure there is sufficient working capital to expand operations outside the United 
States. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a deferred tax liabilityrelated to foreign withholding taxes on approximately $10.3 billion of undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2021. Withholding taxes of
approximately $1.5 billion would be payable upon the remittance of these undistributed earnings as of May 31, 2021.
A portion of the Company's foreign operations benefit from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2031.
 This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met ormay be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to 
this tax holiday was $238 million, $238 million and $167 million for the fiscal yearsended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The benefit of
 the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.15, $0.15 and $0.10 for the fiscal years endedMay 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Deferred tax assets as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, were reduced by a valuation allowance. For the
 fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, a valuation allowance was provided forU.S. capital loss carryforwards and on tax benefits generated by certain entities with operating losses. For the fiscal year ended May 31
, 2020, a valuation allowance wasprovided for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards and on tax benefits generated by certain entities with operating losses. There was a $14
 million net decrease in the valuationallowance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to a $62 million net decrease for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020
, and $7 million net decrease for the yearended May 31, 2019.
The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $65 million as of May 31, 2021. If not utilized, such losses will expire as follows:

NOTE 11 — COMMON STOCK AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
COMMON STOCK
The authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no
 par value, are 400 million and 2,400 million, respectively. Eachshare of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of
 Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances withrespect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the holders of Class A
 and Class B CommonStock. From time to time, the Company's Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs for the repurchase of Class B Common Stock. The value o
f repurchasedshares is deducted from Total shareholders' equity through allocation to Capital in excess of stated value and Retained earnings.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive 
Plan (the “Stock Incentive Plan”) provides for the issuance of up to 798 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock inconnection with equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The S
tock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options,stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not
 beless than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant
. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan. The committee hasthe authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the o
ther terms and conditions of the awards. The Company generallygrants stock options and restricted stock on an annual basis. Substantially all awards under the Stock
 Incentive Plan vest ratably over 4 years of continued employment, withstock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant.

NOTE 14 — RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES
The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates,
 and uses derivatives to manage financialexposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. The
 Company formally documents all relationships between designatedhedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all
derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions and assessing, both at inception and on an ongoing basis,
 theeffectiveness of the hedging relationships.
The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2021, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/
Euro, ChineseYuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on 
theinstrument's maturity date.

All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedge instruments are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until Net income is affected
by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. Effec
tive hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlyingexposure. When it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period, hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company
accounts for the associated derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below. Additionally, the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated
as cash flow hedge instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net, if it is probable the forecasted
hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two-month period thereafter. In rare circumstances, the additional period
of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the na
ture of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company.The purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects
 of currency fluctuations on the Company'sconsolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs, non-
functional currency denominated revenues, intercompany revenues, demand creation expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale debt securities and
certain other intercompany transactions.
Product cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment
program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly-
owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.
S. Dollar, thensells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE en

2021 FORM 10-K

Table of Contentsfunctional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These
purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the
 U.S. Dollar.The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming
certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the
 Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, theCompany's payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket
 of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials andoverhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input cos
ts”) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in thelocal or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S.
 Dollarand the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon 
the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order. Embedded derivativecontracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.
The Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed.
Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months
 in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100%of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The
 total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $17.4billion as of May 31, 2021.
As of May 31, 2021, approximately $369 million of deferred net losses (net of tax) on both
 outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income(loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual
amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature.
 As of May 31, 2021, themaximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.
FAIR VALUE HEDGES
The Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of
 changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by theCompany to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2021.
NET INVESTMENT HEDGES
The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the fu
ture, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned internationaloperations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the
foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as
 of May 31, 2021.UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets
 and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/orembedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their
corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or
embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $4.8 billion as of May 31,
 2021.EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES
As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the fac
tory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order forcurrencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In
 addition, embedded derivativecontracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to
 currencies that are not the functionalcurrency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated
 as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the relatedcontract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other
(income) expense, net, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.
As of May 31, 2021, the total notional amount o
f embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $415 million.2021 FORM 10-K

Table of ContentsCREDIT RISK
The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are
major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is
limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To
 manage this risk, the Company has established strictcounterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
The Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness and
their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the
owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of 
the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of outstandingderivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral

amortization related to the Company's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign
currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, Corporate included a non-recurring impairment charge,
recognized as a result of the Company's decision to transition certain NIKE Brand businesses within APLA to
 a third-party distributor. This charge primarily reflected theanticipated release of associated non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses. For more information regarding this charge, refer to Note 20 — Acquisitions and
Divestitures
. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which represents
Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Sta
tements of Income.As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand
entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of 
the future selling seasonsto which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to
 the spring and summerselling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost
 of sales for geographic operatingsegments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the
 entity's functional currency. Differences betweenassigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the
Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

Table of ContentsNOTE 18 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
As of May 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had bank guarantees
 and letters of credit outstanding totaling $275 million and $239 million, respectively, issued primarily for realestate agreements, self-insurance programs and other general business obligations.
In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for
legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the
Company's historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the
Company's financial position or results of operations.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark
rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of
 its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currentlyidentified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

ACQUISITIONS
During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company made multiple acquisitions focused on gaining new capabilities to fuel its Consumer Direct Offense strategy, serving
consumers personally at a global scale. The impact of acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, was not considered material to the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements.
DIVESTITURES
During fiscal 2020, as a result of the Company's decision to transition its wholesale and direct to consumer operating model in certain countries within its APLA operating
segment, the Company signed definitive agreements to sell its NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to third-party distributors. Specifically, NIKE
entered into agreements to sell its operations in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to Grupo Axo and to sell substantially all of its operations in 
Brazil to Grupo SBF S.A., through itswholly-owned subsidiary. The Company has maintained a small operation in Brazil focused on certain sports marketing assets, local manufacturing and Converse.
As a result of this decision, beginning in fiscal 2020, the related assets and liabilities of these entities were classified as held-for-sale within Prepaid expenses and other current
assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
BRAZIL
During fiscal 2021, the transaction with Grupo SBF S.A. closed, and
 the Company recognized a loss of approximately $50 million within Other (income) expense, net classifiedwithin Corporate, on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Cash proceeds received were reflected within Other investing activities on the Consolidated Sta
tements of CashFlows.
As of May 31, 2020, held-for-sale assets and liabilities consisted of the following:
•
Held-for-sale assets of $272 million, primarily consisting of $142 million of Inventories and $101 million of Accounts receivable, net; and •
Held-for-sale liabilities of $91 million, primari ly consisting of $51 million of Accrued liabilities.ARGENTINA, CHILE AND URUGUAY
During fiscal 2021, the Company and Grupo Axo mutually agreed to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of
 NIKE’s businesses in Argentina, Chile andUruguay to a distributor partnership. However, as the Company remains committed to selling its legal entities in all three countries and granting distribution rights to third-party
distributors, the assets and liabilities of the entities have remained classified as held-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of May 31, 2021, held-for-sale assets and liabilities consisted of the following:
•
Held-for-sale assets of $175 million, primarily consisting of $76 million of Inventories and $59 million of Accounts receivable, net; and •
Held-for-sale liabilities of $72 million, primari ly consisting of $25 million of Accounts payable and $22 million of Accrued liabilities.As of May 31, 2020, held-for-sale assets and liabilities consisted of the following:
•
Held-for-sale assets of $234 million, primarily consisting of $122 million of Inventories and $50 million of Prepaid expenses and other current assets; and •
Held-for-sale liabilities of $55 million, primari ly consisting of $34 million of Accrued liabilities.(1)2021 FORM 10-K

Table of ContentsThe Company has recognized total expected net losses of $358 million as of May 31, 2021, related to
 the Argentina, Chile and Uruguay transaction within Other (income)expense, net, classified within Corporate, and a corresponding allowance within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The initial expected loss of $405
million recognized in fiscal 2020 and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value is largely due to the anticipated release of the cumulative net foreign currency translation
losses. These losses will be reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Net income upon sale of the legal entities. For more information see Note 6
— Fair Value Measurements.
OTHER DIVESTITURES
On October 29, 2019, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell the asse
ts and liabilities of its wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Hurley. The transaction closed onDecember 6, 2019, and the impacts of the divestiture were not considered material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
NOTE 21 — RESTRUCTURING
During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company announced a new digitally empowered phase of its Consumer Direct Offense strategy: Consumer Direct Acceleration. As a
result, management announced a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up strategic execution for the Company. These changes resulted
in a net reduction of the Company's global workforce, and during fiscal 2021, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $294 million, which relate to employee termination costs
and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. This amount reflects

ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURE
There has been no change of accountants nor any disagreements with accountants on any
 matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosurerequired to be reported under this Item.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended ("the Exchange Act") reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
We carry out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of 
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and ChiefFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of May 31, 2021.
“Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” is included in Item 8 of this Report.
We are continuing several transformation initiatives to centralize and simplify our business processes and systems. These are long-term initiatives, which we believe will
enhance our internal control over financial reporting due to increased automation and further integration of related processes. We will continue to monitor our internal control
over financial reporting for effectiveness throughout these transformation initiatives.
There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

During the fourth quarter of fisc al 2021, management identified misstatements related to the amounts disclosed within Charged to Costs and Expenses and Write-offs, net. Specifically, Charged to Costs andExpenses was understated by 
$286 million and $250 million for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, with a corresponding understatement of Write-offs, net. The Company assessed the materiality of thesemisstatements on prior period fin
ancial statements in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality, codified in ASC 250, Presentation of FinancialStatements, and concluded t
hese misstatements were not material to any prior period. As such, the Company has revised the amounts disclosed within Charged to Costs and Expenses and Write-offs, net forthe fiscal years 2020 and 2
