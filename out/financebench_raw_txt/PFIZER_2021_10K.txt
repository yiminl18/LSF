for shareholders and otherstakeholders:
1.
Unleash the power of our people ; 2.
Deliver first-in-class science ; 3.
Transform our go-to-market model ; 4.
Win the digital race in pharma ; and 5.
Lead the conversation . In addition, Pfizer continues to enhance its ESG s
trategy, which is focused on six areas where we see opportunities to create a meaningful impact over the next decade: productinnovation; equitable access and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; climate change; and business ethics.
We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also
through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities
and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and
 our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular,ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.
Our significant recent business development activities in 2021 include, among others: (i) the July 2021 global collaboration with Arvinas to develop and commercialize ARV-471, an
investigational oral PROTAC® (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera) estrogen receptor protein degrader (the estrogen receptor is a well-known disease driver in most breast cancers); (ii)
the November 2021 collaboration and license agreement with Biohaven to acquire rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines
outside of the U.S. upon approval; (iii) the November 2021 acquisition of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing innovative potential therapies for the
treatment of cancer; and (iv) the December 2021 research collaboration with Beam to utilize Beam’s in vivo base editing programs, which use mRNA and lipid nanoparticles, for three
targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. In addition, in December 2021, we entered into a
 definitive agreement to acquire Arena, a clinicalstage company developing innovative potential therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases. On February 2, 2022, Arena shareholders voted to approve the
proposed acquisition, which is targeted to close in the first half of 2022, subject to
 review under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions. For a further discussion of ourstrategy and our business development initiatives, see the
 Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A and Note 2 . In 2020 and 2021, our business, operations and financial condition and results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To confront
 the public health challenge posed by thepandemic, we have made some important advances, including, the development of a vaccine to help prevent

Item 1A. Risk Factors—COVID-19 Pandemic  section in this Form 10-K. COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS
Following (i) the spin-off and combination of the Upjohn Business (which was our global, primarily off-patent branded and generics business) with Mylan in 2020, which created a new
global pharmaceutical company, Viatris, and (ii) the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK in 2019, we saw the culmination of Pfizer’s transformation into a more
focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we operated as a single operating segment engaged in the
discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter 2021, we reorganized
our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager:
Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business, and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty
active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Our Biopharma business includes the following therapeutic areas and key products:

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2 021, PC1 had been managed within the Hospital therapeutic area. Also, on December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, which was part of the Hospitaltherapeutic area prior to
 its sale. See Note 1A for additional information. For additional information on our operating segments and products, see 
Note 17 and for additional information on the key operational revenue drivers of our business, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income
 section within MD&A. For a discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on certain of our major products, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Concentration
 section in this Form 10-K. COLLABORATION AND CO-PROMOTION
We use collaboration and/or co-promotion arrangements to enhance our development, R&D, sales and distribution of certain biopharmaceutical products, which include, among
others, the following:
•
Comirnaty/BNT162b2 is an mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent COVID-19, which is being jointly developed and commercialized with BioNTech. Pfizer and BioNTech equally share the costs of development for the Comirnaty program. Comirnaty/BNT162b2 has been granted an approval or an authorization in many countries around the
world in populations varying by country. We also share gross profits equally from commercialization of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and are working jointly with BioNTech in our respective
territories to commercialize the vaccine worldwide (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), subject to regulatory authorizations or approvals market by market. For
discussion on Comirnaty/BNT162b2, see the 
Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—COVID-19 Pandemic section within MD&A. •
Eliquis (apixaban) is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market and was jointly developed and commercialized with BMS as an alternative treatment option to warfarin in appropriate patients. We fund between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on 
the study, and profits and losses are shared equally except in certain countries wherewe commercialize Eliquis and pay a percentage of net sales to BMS. In certain smaller markets we have full commercialization rights and BMS supplies the product to us at cost
plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers.
•
Xtandi (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas. We share equally in the gross profits and losses related to U.S. net sales and also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs
attributable to the U.S. market, subject to certain exceptions.
 In addition, we share certain development and other collaboration expenses. For international net sales we receiveroyalties based on a tiered percentage.
•
Bavencio (avelumab) is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. We jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs and split profits equally related to net sales generated from any products containing avelumab.
•
Orgovyx (relugolix) is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer that is being developed and commercialized with Myovant. The companies are also collaborating on
 Myfembree  (relugolix 40 Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 4 
mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women and the management of moderateto severe pain associated with endometriosis. The companies will equally share profits and allowable expenses in the U.S. and Canada for Orgovyx and Myfembree, with Myovant
bearing our share of allowable expenses up to a maximum of $50 million in 2022. Myovant will remain responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continue to lead
clinical development for the relugolix combination tablet.
Revenues associated with these arrangements are included in Alliance revenues (except in certain markets where we have direct sales and except for the majority of revenues for
Comirnaty/BNT162b2, which are included as direct product revenues). In addition, we have collaboration arrangements for the development and commercialization of certain pipeline
products that are in development stage, including, among others, (i) with BioNTech to develop a modified mRNA-based vaccine for the prevention of varicella zoster (Shingles), and
(ii) with Valneva to co-develop and commercialize Valneva’s Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15. For further discussion of collaboration and co-promotion agreements, see the
Item 1A. Risk Factors—Collaborations and Other Relationships with Third Parties 
section in this Form 10-K and Notes 2  and  17.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
R&D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we work to translate advanced science and
 technologies into the therapies that maybe the most impactful for patients. The discovery and development of drugs, vaccines and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. 
In addition to discoveringand developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and
 ease of dosing and by discovering potential newindications.
Our R&D Priorities and Strategy. 
Our R&D priorities include: •
delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need;•
advancing our capabilities that can position us for long-term R&D leadership; and•
advancing new models for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.To that end, our R&D primarily focuses on our main therapeutic areas.
While a significant portion of our R&D is internal, we also seek promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into
our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines. We do so by entering into collaboration, alliance and license agreements with universities,
biotechnology companies and other firms as well as through acquisitions and investments. These collaboration, alliance and license agreements and investments allow us to share
knowledge, risk and cost. They also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise, as well as provide us the opportunity to
 advance our own products and in-licensed or acquired products. For information on certain of these collaborations, alliances and license arrangements and investments, see 
Note 2 . Our R&D Operations. 
In 2021, we continued to strengthen our global R&D operations and pursue strategies to improve R&D productivity to achieve a sus tainable pipeline that ispositioned to deliver value in the near term and over time
.  Our R&D activity is conducted through various platform functions that operate in parallel within our global operations,including the following:
•
WRDM. Research units within WRDM are generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of- concept) and are organized by therapeutic area to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. We can rapidly redeploy resources within a research unit and between various
projects to leverage, as necessary, common skills, expertise or focus.
•
GPD. Our  GPD organization is a unified center for clinical development and regulatory activities that is generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operationalexecution of clinical trials for late-stage clinical assets in Pfizer’s pipeline.
•
Science-based platform-services organizations within WRDM. These organizations provide technical expertise and other services to various R&D projects, and are organized into science-based functions. These organizations allow us to react more quickly and effectively to evolving needs by sharing resources among projects, candidates and targets
across therapeutic areas and phases of development. Examples of these platform organizations include Pharmaceutical Sciences and Medicine Design, and Worldwide Medical
and Safety.
We manage R&D operations on a total-company basis through our platform functions described above. Specifically, the Portfolio Strategy 
& Investment committee, composed ofsenior executives, is accountable for aligning resources among all of our WRDM, GPD and R&D projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative
R&D portfolio. We believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility.
We do not disaggregate total R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above,
 we do not manage our R&D operations by development phaseor by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, we believe that any
 prior-period information about R&D expense by developmentphase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.
For additional information, see the 
Costs and Expenses — Research and Development (R&D) Expenses section within MD&A and Note 17 . Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 5 
Our R&D Pipeline. The process of drug and biological product discovery from initiation through development and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take more than ten years. As of February 8, 2022, we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&D:
Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While our drug candidates may or may not receive regulatory approval, new candidates entering
clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing
products, is set forth in the 
Product Developments  section within MD&A. For information on the risks associated with R&D, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Research and Development
 section of this Form 10-K. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
Our operations are conducted globally, and we sell our products in over 125 countries. Emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our
commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found
within developed markets. Urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets provide potential growth opportunities for our products.
Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $51.5 billion accounted for 63% of our 
total revenues in 2021. Revenues exceeded $500 million in each of 21, 8 and 10 countriesoutside the U.S. in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the
 increase in the number of countries in 2021 primarily driven by Comirnaty/BNT162b2. By total revenues, Japan wasour largest national market outside the U.S. in 2021. For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the 
Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income — Revenues by Geographysection within MD&A and the table captioned 
Geographic Information  in Note 17B. 
Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Global Operations and Item 1. Business
— Government Regulation and Price Constraints sections in this Form 10-K. SALES AND MARKETING
Our prescription biopharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In the
U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Outside the
U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. Certain of these government contracts may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of
 agovernment entity. In addition, our contracts with government and supranational organizations for the sales of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and Paxlovid, which are on a
 committed basis,represented a significant amount of revenues in 2021. We also seek to gain access for our products on
 formularies, which are lists of approved medicines available to members ofhealthcare programs or PBMs. PBMs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products, to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions. We
may also work with payers on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients and physicians on key disease areas. For information on
our significant customers, see 
Note 17C . We promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products 
to healthcareproviders and patients; MCOs that provide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, integrated delivery systems, PBMs and health plans; and
 employers and government agencies whohire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. In the U.S., we market directly to
 consumers through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approveduses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate
 the publicon disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues and our patient assistance programs.

PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTSPatents
. We own or license a number of patents covering pharmaceutical and other products, their uses, formulations, and product manufacturing processes. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent
 filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection isobtained. The scope of protection afforded by a patent
 can vary from country to country and depends on the patent type, the scope of its patent claims and the availability of legalremedies. Patent term extensions (PTE) may be available in some countries to compensate for a loss of patent
 term due to delay in a product’s approval due to the regulatoryrequirements. One of the primary considerations in limiting our operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products,
although international and U.S. free trade agreements have included some improved global protection of intellectual property rights. For additional information, see the 
Item 1. Business
— Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K. In various markets, a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided for drugs or vaccines upon approval. The scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but, in general, the period
will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the time of approval.
Based on current sales, and considering the competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to
 our business as a whole,together with the year in which the basic product patent expires, are as follows:

Unless otherwise indicated, the y
ears pertain to the basic product patent expiration, including granted PTEs, supplementary protection certificates (SPC) or pediatric exclusivity periods. SPCs are included when grantedin three out of five major Europ
ean markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.). Noted in parentheses is the projected year of expiry of the earliest pending patent term extension in the U.S. or Japan and/orSPC application in Europe, the t
erm of which, if granted, may be shorter than originally requested due to a number of factors. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products which may or maynot protect our product from g
eneric or biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.The basic product patent for Ch
antix expired in the U.S. in November 2020 and in Europe in September 2021.The basic product patent
 for Sutent expired in the U.S. in August 2021 and in Europe in January 2022.Expiry is provided by regulatory excl
usivity in this market.The Europe patent that covers t
he combination of the 13 serotype conjugates of Prevenar 13 was revoked following an opposition and has now been withdrawn. There are other Europe patents and pending applicationscovering the formulation
, various aspects of the manufacturing process, and the combination of serotype conjugates of Prevenar 13 that remain in force.Eliquis was developed and is 
being commercialized in collaboration with BMS. For Eliquis in the U.S., two patents listed in the FDA Orange Book, the composition of matter patent claiming apixaban specifically and aformulation patent, were chall
enged by numerous generic companies and were the subject of patent infringement litigation. Prior to the resolution of the litigation in our favor on both challenged patents, we and BMSsettled with a number of these 
generic companies (settled generic companies) while continuing to litigate against three remaining generic companies (remaining generic companies). As a result of the litigation, theremaining generic compani
es are not permitted to launch their products until the 2031 expiration date of the formulation patent. Under the terms of the settlement agreements, the permitted date of launch for the settledgeneric companies under t
hese patents is April 1, 2028.Both patents may be subject to s
ubsequent challenges. While we cannot predict the outcome of any potential future litigation, these are the alternatives that might occur: (a) if both patents are upheld in future litigation,through appeal, the p
ermitted date of launch for the settled generic companies under these patents would remain April 1, 2028; (b) if the formulation patent is held invalid or not infringed in future litigation, throughappeal, the settled gen
eric companies and any successful future litigant would be permitted to launch on November 21, 2026; or (c) if both patents are held invalid or not infringed in future litigation, through appeal, thesettled generic companies
 and any successful future litigant could launch products immediately upon such an adverse decision.Refer to

on rights for Comirnaty in Germany.The basic product patent ap
plication for Paxlovid has been filed in these markets. If granted, a full term is expected in these markets.Loss of Intellectual Property Rights. 
The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co- promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Once patent protection has expired or has been lost
 prior to the expiration date as a result of alegal challenge, we typically lose exclusivity on these products, and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce identical or highly similar products and sell
them for a lower price. The date at which generic or biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires. However, when
generic or biosimilar competition does commence, the resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products, often in a very short period of
time. Also, if one of our product-related patents is found to be
 invalid by judicial, court or regulatory or administrative proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could be introduced,resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products.
We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts 
that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while takingnecessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Competitive Products, — Intellectual Property Protection and —
Third-Party Intellectual Property Claims sections in this Form 10-K and Note 16A1 . Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to
 faceincreased generic competition over the next few years. For additional information on the impact of LOEs on our revenues, see 
the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income––Revenues––Selected Product Discussion 
section within MD&A. Trademarks
. Our products are sold under brand-name and logo trademarks and trade dress. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms and protection is provided in some countries for as long as the mark is used while in others, for as long as it is registered. Protecting our trademarks is of material importance to Pfizer.
COMPETITION
Our business is conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our products face competition in the
 form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilarsthat treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost
. Though the means of competition vary among our products,demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success.
We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat or prevent diseases or indications similar to those treated
 or prevented by our major products. Thesecompetitors include other worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller resea
rch companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and biosimilarmanufacturers. Our competitors also may devote substantial funds and resources to R&D and their successful R&D could result in erosion of the
 sales of our existing products andpotential sales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without
 large R&D expenses and make aregular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration.
To address competitive trends we continually emphasize innovation, which is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our business development
transactions, both designed to result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research continues even after drug or vaccine approval as we seek
 to further demonstrate thevalue of our products for the conditions they treat or prevent, as well as poten
tial new applications. We educate patients, physicians, payers and global health authorities on thebenefits and risks of our medicines and vaccines, and seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of our biopharmaceutical functions, including to accurately and
ethically launch and market our products to our customers.
Operating conditions have also shifted as a result of increased global competitive pressures, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to
 evaluate, adapt and improveour organization and business practices in an effort to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that
 we have taken an industry-leading role in evolving our approaches toU.S. direct-to-consumer advertising, interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals and medical education grants. We also continue to sponsor programs to address
patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through our support for be
tter healthcare solutions.Our vaccines may face competition, including from the introduction of alternative vaccines or “next-generation” vaccines prior to or after the expiration of their patents, which may
adversely affect our future results.
Our biosimilars, which include biosimilars of certain inflammation & immunology and oncology biologic med
icines, compete with branded products from competitors, as well as othergenerics and biosimilars manufacturers. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “first-to-

market” or early market position for our biosimilars to provide customers a lower-cost alternative immediately when available and also to potentially provide us with higher levels ofsales and profitability until other competitors enter the market.
Generic Products
. Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers pose one of the biggest competitive challenges to our branded small molecule products because they can market acompeting version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often
 charge much less. Several competitors regularly challenge our product patents before theirexpiration. Generic competitors often operate without large R&D expenses, as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to 
the medical community. Inaddition, the FDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on
the safety and efficacy data of the
 innovator product. In China, for example, we expect to continue to face intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2022 andbeyond, which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products. In addition, generic versions of competitors’ branded products may also compete with our products.
MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to
brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S., and U.S. laws generally allow, and in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for
brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution.
Biosimilars. 
Certain of our biologic products, including Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), already face, or may face in the future,  competition from biosimilars(also referred to as follow-on biologics). Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of
safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency
. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives toinnovative biologic medicines. In the U.S., 
biosimilars referencing innovative biologic products are approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act. PRICING PRESSURES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS
Commercial Pricing Pressures. 
Pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continue to be significant. Overall, there is increasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health ou
tcomes. Many employers have adopted high deductible health plans,which can increase out-of-pocket costs for medicines. This trend is likely to continue. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product
pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products. Pricing pressures also may occur as a result of highly competitive
insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or
purchasing review processes.
Longer term, we foresee a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward providers for cost
reductions and improved patient outcomes. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to
, new medicines. At the same time, thesemodels can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider drugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions.
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related large-scale healthcare disruptions, we expect value-based payment models may have reduced participation if the incentives to
participate are reduced or eliminated. Financially weakened hospitals may weigh their ability to take on the financial risk of downside models. In contrast, providers in more advanced
value-based models, such as full capitation, a fixed amount paid in advance per patient per unit of time-period, generally found their revenues remained steady during the pandemic,
which may ultimately encourage the growth of such models.
We believe medicines and vaccines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value 
they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We work with lawmakers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to 
the healthcare system, and help ensure access to medicines and vaccines within anefficient and affordable healthcare system. This includes assessing our go-to market model to address patient affordability challenges. We have engaged with major payors and the
U.S. government to explore opportunities to improve access and reimbursement in an effort to drive pro-patient policies. In addition, in response to the
 evolving U.S. and globalhealthcare spending landscape, we work with health authorities, health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major U.S. payers throughout the product-
development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products. Further, we are developing stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating
the value of the medicines and vaccines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by recognizing patterns of usage
 of our medicines and vaccines and competitormedicines and vaccines along with patterns of healthcare costs.

Item 1. Business — Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors — Pricing and Reimbursementsections in this Form 10-K.
Managed Care Organizations. 
The evolution of managed care in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitiveness o f the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 302 millionpeople in the U.S. now have some form of health insurance coverage, and the marketing of prescription drugs and vaccines to
 both consumers and the entities that manage coveragein the U.S. continues to grow in importance. In particular, the influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due
 to the growing number of patients receiving coverage throughMCOs. At the same time, consolidation in the MCO industry has resulted in fewer, even larger MCOs, which enhances those MCOs’ ability to negotiate
 pricing and increases theirimportance to our business. Since MCOs seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures, their growing influence has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues.
MCOs typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to MCO members), clinica
l protocols (whichrequire prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a
branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded medicines on
higher-tier or non-preferred status in their formularies, MCOs transfer a portion of the cost to the patient, resulting in significant patient out-of-pocket
 expenses. This financialdisincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. The 
ACA has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk acrossMCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs, which creates
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 9 
pressure on MCOs to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes. We are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them.The breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment
of particular medical problems. MCOs also emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as ways to manage
costs. Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed, and drugs that can
 reduce the need for hospitalization, professionaltherapy or surgery may become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases.
Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population and beyond. Consequently,
pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products, typically on the basis of unique product features, such as greater e
fficacy, better patient ease ofuse, or fewer side effects, as well as the overall cost of the 
therapy. We have been generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCOformularies. However, increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors
— Managed Care Trends section in this Form 10-K. RAW MATERIALS
We procure raw materials essential to our business from numerous suppliers worldwide. In general, these materials have been available in sufficient quantities to support our demand
and in many cases are available from multiple suppliers. No significant impact to our operations due to the availability of raw materials is currently anticipated in 2022. However, we
are seeing an increase in overall demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials with the potential to constrain available supply, which could have a future impact on
our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact, including active supplier management, qualification
of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS
We are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which we do business. This includes laws and regulations governing the operations of
biopharmaceutical companies, such as the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products, pricing (including discounts and rebates) and health information privacy, among
others. These laws and regulations may require administrative guidance for implementation, and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and/or administrative actions.
Enforcement measures may include substantial fines and/or penalties, orders to stop non-compliant activities, criminal charges, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delays in
product approvals, exclusion from participation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions, and could result in harm
to our reputation and business. For additional information, see 
Note 16A. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly, and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. While capital expenditures or operating costs for compliance with government regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not
currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position.
In the United States
Drug and Biologic Regulation
. The FDA, pursuant to the FFDCA, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, extensively regulates pre- and post-marketing activities related to our biopharmaceutical products. The regulations govern areas such as the safety and efficacy of medicines and vaccines, clinical trials, advertising and
promotion, quality control, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, post-marketing safety surveillance and reporting, and record keeping. Other U.S. federal agencies, including the DEA,
also regulate certain of our products and activities.
For a biopharmaceutical company to market a drug or a biologic product, including vaccines, in the U.S., the FDA must evaluate whether the
 product is safe and effective for itsintended use. If the FDA determines that the drug or biologic is safe and
 effective, the FDA will approve the product’s NDA or BLA (or supplemental NDA or supplemental BLA), asappropriate.
A drug or biologic may be subject to postmarketing commitments, which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct, or postmarketing requirements, which
are studies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cGMPs (the FDA regulations that
govern all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals) and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (the law that, among other things,
 sets forth requirements related to producttracing, product identifiers and verification for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers and dispensers to facilitate the tracing of product through the pharmaceutical
distribution supply chain), as well as advertising and promotion regulations. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Development, Regulatory Approval andMarketing of Products 
and  —Post-Authorization/Approval Data sections in this Form 10-K. In the context of public health emergencies, like the COVID-19 pandemic, we may apply to the
 FDA for an EUA, which if granted, allows for the distribution and use of our productsduring the declared emergency, in accordance with the conditions set forth in the EUA, unless the 
EUA is otherwise terminated by the government. Although the criteria for an EUAdiffer from the criteria for approval of an NDA or BLA, EUAs nevertheless require the development and submission of data 
to satisfy the relevant FDA standards, and a number ofongoing obligations. The FDA generally expects EUA holders to work toward submission of full applications, such as a BLA or an NDA, as soon
 as possible.Biosimilar Regulation.
 The FDA is responsible for approval of biosimilars. Innovator biologics are entitled to 12 years of market exclusivity by statute, and biosimilars applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic.
Sales and Marketing Regulations
.  Our marketing practices are subject to state laws, as well as federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, intended toprevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. The Anti-Kickback Statute
 generally prohibits corruptly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generatebusiness. The False Claims Act generally prohibits anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods or services,
including to government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent. The federal
government and states also regulate sales and marketing activities and financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, requiring disclosure to government
authorities and the public of such interactions, and the adoption of compliance standards or programs. State
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 10 
attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws.Pricing, Reimbursement and Access Regulations.
 Pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation. Any significant efforts at the federal or sta televels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded or more directly impose controls on drug pricing, government reimbursement, and access
to medicines and vaccines on public and private insurance plans could have a material impact on us.
In addition, in order to have our products covered by Medicaid, we must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of
 pharmaceutical products under various federal and state programs.We also must report specific prices to government agencies. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose
us to enforcement measures. See the discussion regarding rebates in the 
Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income — Revenues by Geography section within MD&A and Note 1H.
Government and private payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products, and 
there is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceuticalpricing. Efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including proposed actions to
 facilitate drug importation, limitreimbursement to lower international reference prices, require deep discounts, and require manufacturers to report and make public price increases and sometimes a written
justification for the increase, could adversely affect our business if implemented. We expect to see continued 
focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricingwhich could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, there is proposed legislation that, if enacted, would allow Medicare to negotiate prices
for certain prescription drugs, as well as require that penalties be paid by manufacturers who raise drug prices faster than inflation. In addition, changes to the
 Medicaid program or thefederal 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities, could have a material
impact on our business. For example, certain changes issued in a final rule by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in December 2020 to the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program could increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and increase the discounts we extend to 340B covered entities. Additional changes to the 340B
 program are undergoingreview and their status is unclear. For additional information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Pricing and Reimbursement section in this Form 10-K. A majority of states use preferred drug lists to manage access to pharmaceutical products under Medicaid, including some of our products. For example, access to our products
 underthe Medicaid managed care programs typically is determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agencies contract to provide services to beneficiaries. States seek to
control healthcare costs related to Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreements under the Medicaid drug rebate
program tied to patient outcomes. States’ budgets were impacted less by the COV
ID-19 pandemic than expected and are generally growing. We expect states to seek cost cuttingwithin Medicaid, which may focus on managed care capitation payments and/or formulary management. States may also advance drug-pricing initiatives with a focus on affordability
review boards, financial penalties related to pricing practices, manufacturer pricing and reporting requirements, as well as regulation of prescription drug assistance or copay
accumulator programs in the commercial market. Payers may promote generic drugs and biosimilars more aggressively to generate savings and attempt to stimulate additional price
competition. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains, wholesalers and PBMs will increase pricing pressures in the industry. For additional
information, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Managed Care Trends section in this Form 10-K. Anti-Corruption. 
The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in
many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
Data Privacy. 
The collection and use of personal data by us is increasingly important to our business and is subject to various federal and state privacy and da ta security laws andregulations, including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies. Such laws and regulations continue to evolve and are increasingly being enforced vigorously.
Outside the United States
New Drug Approvals.
 In the EU, the EMA conducts the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of our innovative medicinal products, and employs a centralizedprocedure for approval for the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) countries. In 
the U.K., the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is the sole regulatoryauthority. In Japan, the PMDA is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. In China, the
NMPA is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines. Health authorities in many middle- and lower-income countries require marketing approva
l by arecognized regulatory authority (e.g., the FDA or EMA) before they begin to conduct 
their application review process and/or issue their final approval.Pharmacovigilance.
 In the EU, the EMA’s PRAC is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues. Outside developed markets, pharmacovigilancerequirements vary and are generally not as extensive, but there is a trend toward increasing regulation.
Pricing and Reimbursement
. Certain governments, including in the different EU member states, the U.K., Japan, China, Canada and South Korea, provide healthcare at low-to-zerodirect cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for 
the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global financing pressures. Governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs, including proposing price
reform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access,
“international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP.
 In addition, the internationalpatchwork of price regulation, differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in many markets and
some third-party trade in our products between countries. Several important multilateral organizations such as the WHO are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing
through policy recommendations and sponsorship of programs, such as “The Oslo Medicines Initiative” which is planning a high-level meeting in 2022 to agree on WHO Europe
Member States’ commitments to ensure “affordability for high-priced medicines”. In November 2020, the EC published its new Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe which envisions a
broad range of new initiatives and legislation including a significant focus on affordability and access to medicines.
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 11 
In China, pricing pressures have increased in recent years because of an overall focus on healthcare cost containment with government officials emphasizing improved healthoutcomes, healthcare reform and decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards reform. For patented products, drug prices have decreased dramatically as a result of
adding innovative drugs (including oncology medicines) to the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL). In the off-patent space, numerous local generics have been officially
deemed bioequivalent under a QCE process that required domestically-manufactured generic drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug
(typically the originator drug). A centralized VBP program, a tender process where a certain portion of included molecule volumes are guaranteed to tender winners and is intended to
contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics that have passed QCE, has resulted in dramatic price cuts for of
f-patent medicines. Furthermore, the Chinese governmenthas discussed moving toward efforts to unify the reimbursement price between QCE-approved generic medicines and the applicable original medicines, which the government
currently plans to implement within the next few years. We and most off-patent originators have mostly not been success
ful in the VBP bidding process. The government has indicatedthat additional post-LOE drugs could be subjected to VBP qualification in fu
ture rounds. While certain details of future QCE expansion have been made available, we are unable todetermine the impact on our business and financial condition until the initiation of these future rounds.
Healthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures.
 Several countries have implemented laws requiring (or industry trade associations have recommended) disclosure of transfers ofvalue made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers and/or healthcare organizations, such as academic teaching hospitals.
Intellectual Property
.  Reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and R&D investment. The WTOAgreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) requires participant countries to provide patent and o
ther intellectual property-related protection forpharmaceutical products by law, with an exemption provided for least-developed countries until 2033. While some countries have made improvements, we still face patent grant,
enforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries.
While the global intellectual property policy environment has generally improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our growth and ability to bring new
product innovation to patients depends on further progress in intellectual property protection. In certain developed international markets, governments maintain relatively effective
intellectual property policies. However, in the EU, pursuant to the ongoing review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentives, legislative change may result in the
reduction of certain protections. In several emerging market countries, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force innovators to accept less 
than fair valuefor medicines, as well as to advance industrial policy and localization goals. Discussions are ongoing at the WTO that seek to limit intellectual property protections within the context of
the COVID-19 pandemic response.
Considerable political and economic pressure has weakened current intellectual property protection in some countries and has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for
obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions, revocation of pa
tents, laws orregulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data
protection.
Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturers, underscoring the importance of s
trong intellectual propertysystems for local innovative industries and helping improve patients’ access to innovative medicines and vaccines.
Data Privacy. 
Outside of the U.S., many countries have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerning the collection and use  of personal data, including but not limited to,the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations and China’s Personal Information Protection Law. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues
worldwide is also rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt new and updated privacy and data security laws. The interpretation and application of such laws and regulations
remain uncertain and continue to evolve. In addition, enforcement of such laws and regulations is increasing.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend 
to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance withapplicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. We incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2021 for
environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows: $55 million in environment-related capital expenditures and $152 million in other
environment-related expenses.
While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our
capital expenditures or competitive position. See also 
Note 16A3 . Climate change presents risks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, the potential for more frequent and severe
weather events, and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities or supply
chain due to climate change will not occur in the future. We periodically review our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and other natural disasters and update our
assessments accordingly. Based on our reviews, we do not believe these potential risks are material to our operations at this time.
HUMAN CAPITAL
Our purpose is: 
Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives . These breakthroughs are delivered through the relentless collaboration of our talented workforce. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 79,000 people worldwide, with approximately 29,000 based in the U.S. Women compose approximately 49% of our global workforce, and
approximately 34% of our U.S.-based employees are individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds.
Our continued success links directly to the commitment, engagement and performance of our employees. It is important that
 we not only attract and retain the best and brightestdiverse talent, but also ensure they remain engaged and can thrive in an environment that is committed to helping them grow, succeed and
 contribute directly to achieving ourpurpose. As part of these efforts, we strive for an
 inclusive and empowering work environment, adopting practices to simplify processes and remove needless complexity, rewardingboth performance and leadership skills,

fostering career growth and internal mobility and offering competitive compensation and benefits programs that encourage mental and physical well being.Core Values.
 To fully realize Pfizer’s purpose we have established a clear set of goals regarding what we need to achieve for patients and how we will go about achieving them. The“how” is represented by four simple, powerful company values – 
Courage , Excellence, Equity and Joy . Each value defines our company and our culture:•
Courage: Breakthroughs start by challenging convention – especially in the face of uncertainty or adversity. This happens when we think big, speak up and are decisive.•
Excellence: We can only change patients’ lives when we perform at our best together. This happens when we focus  on what matters, agree who does what and measure outcomes.•
Equity: Every person deserves to be seen, heard and cared for. This happens when we are inclusive, act with integrity and  reduce health care disparities.•
Joy: We give ourselves to our work, and it also gives to us. We find joy when we take pride, recognize one another and have fun.Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
 At Pfizer, every person deserves to be seen, heard and cared for,  and we work to further this goal by bringing together people with differentbackgrounds, perspectives and experiences. Our commitments to equity consist of specific actions to help foster a
 more inclusive environment within Pfizer, including, among others:(i) building a more inclusive colleague experience through representation and meaningful connections; (ii) advancing equitable health outcomes by evaluating our work through the
lens of the communities we serve, (iii) providing resources on allyship and the science behind inclusion to support all colleagues in having courageous conversations about equity,
race and the avoidance of bias; (iv) working to help transform society with external diversity, equity and inclusion partnerships, including deploying capital, engaging diverse suppliers
and amplifying equity initiatives; and (v) working to help ensure demographics of clinical trials correlate to those of the countries where trials are taking place.
Colleague Engagement
. To attract, develop and inspire the brightest talent, we aim to support  our colleagues by engaging and partnering with them to help ensure they feel they arepart of a community. We understand the importance of continuously listening and responding to colleague feedback and our annual engagement survey,
 Pfizer Pulse, provides aforum for our colleagues to give structured feedback about their colleague experience. Through this survey, we measure and track key areas of the
 overall colleague experience andequip leaders with actionable insights for discussion and follow up. Regular topics in the survey include: (i) employee engagement, such as colleagues’ commitment to and advocacy
for Pfizer; (ii) purpose, including how colleagues’ work connects with our purpose; (iii) inclusion, such as having a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued; and (iv) growth,
including the ability for colleagues to gain new experiences that align with their individual career goals.
In 2021, we continued to maintain low turnover rates relative to the pharmaceutical industry and
 in  our 2021 Pfizer Pulse survey, on average ,  90% of colleagues reported feelingengaged, as measured by pride in working at Pfizer, willingness to recommend Pfizer as a great place to work and intent to stay. 
In addition, 92% of the colleagues agreed that theirdaily work contributes to our purpose. 
While we are slightly behind in our Bold Moves goal to create room for meaningful work, we continue to make progress on simplifying processes and removing needless complexity. We have committed to tangible actions and principles that incorporate the similar behaviors and mindset we used to develop a COVID-19 vaccine
in an accelerated timeline. These behaviors include working with urgency and overcoming bureaucracy, as well as believing in our purpose, trusting in one another and being
transparent.
Performance, Leadership and Growth.
 We are committed to helping our colleagues reach their full potential by rewarding both their performance and leadership skills and by providingopportunities for growth and development. Our performance management approach—called Performance and Leadership Insights—is based on six-month semesters during which
our colleagues and their managers set goals, receive feedback and meet to discuss performance. These conversations are meant to help colleagues grow and develop by evaluating
performance (what the colleague achieved, measured by outcomes), leadership (how they achieved it, taking into account Pfizer’s values of courage, excellence, equity and joy), and
identifying areas of growth that help move colleagues towards fulfilling their career goals and their potential. Our commitments to colleague development consist of specific actions to
encourage non-linear career growth paths for all colleagues, including (i) a common language around growth—along with a guiding framework—to help colleagues identify their next
best growth experience, (ii) tools and resources to encourage growth conversations and offer transparency on the sources of growth available, and (iii) a variety of programs including
mentoring, job rotations, experiential project roles, skill-based volunteering and learning resources focused on various topics, including leadership and management skills and
industry- and job-specific learning, as well as general business, manufacturing, finance and technology skills.
Health, Safety and Well-Being
. Protecting the health, safety and well-being of colleagues and contingent workers, all of whom are essential to delivering our business objectives, is an integral part of how we operate. Our Global Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Policy and supporting s
tandards outline our approach to assessment, evaluation, elimination, andmitigation of EHS risks across our operations. COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and response continues to be a key focus to help ensure on-site workers at our commercial,
manufacturing and research sites remain safe and healthy while continuing to support work from home arrangements for colleagues who can work remotely. As part of these efforts,
we (i) implemented a vaccination program for colleagues and their families in the U.S. and 23 other countries where employer vaccination programs were possible, (ii) partnered with
and launched Thrive Global, a wellness and organizational change initiative with a primary focus on colleague mental health and wellness, and (iii) hosted educational webinars and
information sessions on mental health and well-being, nutrition and work life balance through our employee assistance program provider.
Pay Equity.
 Our commitment to pay equity for all colleagues is based in our value of Equity  and our intention to continue to build a diverse and inclusive workforce.  We are committedto equitable pay practices at Pfizer for employees based on role, education, experience, performance, and location and we conduct
 and report publicly on pay equity on an annualbasis.

not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Additionally, our business is subject to general risks applicable to any company, such as economicconditions, geopolitical events, extreme weather and natural disasters. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, our business operations, financial condition, operating
results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, prospects, reputation or credit ratings could be adversely affected now and in the future,
 potentially in a materialway. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in the Forward-Looking Information and Factors that May Affect Fu
ture Results sectionin this Form 10-K.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND OPERATIONS:
MANAGED CARE TRENDS
Private payers, such as health plans, and other managed care entities, such as P
BMs, continue to take action to manage the utilization and costs of drugs. The negotiating power ofMCOs and other private third-party payers has increased due to consolidation, and they, along with governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage
utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. These initiatives have increased consumers’ interest and input in
medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to favor lower-cost generic alternatives. We may fail to ob
tain or maintain timely oradequate pricing or formulary placement of our products, or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing.
The growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions, which typically have smaller patient populations,
combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, also has generated increased payer interest in developing cost-containment strategies
targeted to this sector.
Third-party payers also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost
containment efforts. Such payers are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic
product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S.
 private third-party payer marketconsolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, we may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers as they continue to drive more of their
patients to use lower cost generic alternatives.
Also, business arrangements in this area are subject to a high degree of government scrutiny, and available safe harbors under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse
 laws aresubject to change through legislative and regulatory action, as well as evolving judicial interpretations. Our approach to these arrangements may also be informed by such government
and industry guidance.
COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS
Competitive product launches may erode future sales of our products, including our existing products and those currently under development, or result in unanticipated product
obsolescence. Such launches continue to occur, and potentially competitive products are in various stages of development. We
 cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact ofthe introduction of competitive products that treat diseases and conditions like those treated
 by our in-line products and product candidates.In addition, competition from manufacturers of generic drugs, including from generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity, is a major challenge
for our branded products. Certain of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years. For additional information, see the

section in this Form 10-K. In China, we expect to continue to face  intense competition by certain generic manufacturers, which mayresult in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products.
In addition, our patented products may face generic competition before patent exclusivity expires, including upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation
against the generic product) by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products
. Generic manufacturers have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval ofproduct candidates that they claim do not infringe our patents or claim that our patents
 are not valid; these include candidates that would compete with, among other products, Ibranceand Xeljanz. Our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have licenses or co-promotion
rights.
We may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars.
We also commercialize biosimilar products that compete with products of others, including other biosimilar products. The entry to the market of competing biosimilars is expected to
increase pricing pressures on our biosimilar products. Uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various factors, such as anti-competitive practices, access challenges where our
product may not receive appropriate coverage/reimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to an innovator product, physician reluctance to prescribe
biosimilars for existing patients taking the innovative product, or misaligned financial incentives.
For additional information on competition our products face, see the
 Item 1. Business — Competition section in this Form 10-K. CONCENTRATION
We recorded direct product and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products that collectively accounted for 75% of
 our total revenues in 2021. In particular,Comirnaty/BNT162b2 accounted for 45% of our total revenues in 2021. For additional information, see 
Notes 1  and 17 . If these products or any of our other major products were toexperience loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes in prescription or vaccination growth rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects or safety concerns,
regulatory proceedings, negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling, pricing and access pressures or
supply shortages or if a new, more effective product should be introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant.
 In particular, certain of our products haveexperienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and patents covering a number of our best-selling products are, or have
been, the subject of pending legal challenges. For additional information on our patents, see the 
Item 1. Business — Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. For Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 14 
Paxlovid, while we believe that these products have the potential to provide ongoing revenue streams for Pfizer for the foreseeable future, revenues of these products following theCOVID-19 pandemic may not be at the similar levels as those being generated during the pandemic. For information on additional risks associated with Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and
Paxlovid, see the 
COVID-19 Pandemic section below. In addition, we sell our prescription pharmaceutical products principally through wholesalers in the U.S. For additional information, see 
Note 17C . If one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties, it might decrease the amount of business the wholesaler does with us and/or we might be unable to
timely collect all the amounts that the wholesaler owes us or at all, which could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, we expect 
that consolidation and integration ofpharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The discovery and development of new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for 
the continued strength of our business. Ourproduct lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share, as well as to provide for earnings growth, primarily through
internal R&D or through collaborations, acquisitions, JVs, licensing or other arrangements. Growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new
indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers. However, balancing current growth, investment for future growth and the
delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge. The costs of product development continue to be high, as are regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas, which may
affect the number of candidates we are able to fund as well as the
 sustainability of the R&D portfolio. Decisions made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidatecan have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities if the candidate receives regulatory approval. We try to plan clinical trials prudently and
to reasonably anticipate and address challenges, but there is no assurance that an optimal balance between trial conduct, speed
 and desired outcome will be achieved.Additionally, our product candidates can fail at any stage of the R&D process, and
 may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of R&D. We may fail to correctly identifyindications for which our science is promising or allocate R&D investment resources efficiently, and failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, product
classes, geographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline. Further, even if we identify areas with the greatest commercial
potential, the scientific approach may not succeed despite the significant investment required for R&D, and the
 product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highlydynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement. For example, our gene therapy product candidates are based on a novel technology with only a
few gene therapies approved to date, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cos
t of development and the ability to obtain regulatory approval. Further, gene therapy may facedifficulties in gaining the acceptance of patients or the medical community.
GLOBAL OPERATIONS
We operate on a global scale and could be affected by currency fluctuations, capital and exchange
 controls, global economic conditions including inflation, expropriation and otherrestrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, trade regulations, tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting
approval, production, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action, including the current
conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems, inter-governmental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, natural
disasters or disruptions related to climate change.
Some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for
healthcare spending. As a result of these and other factors, our s
trategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful, and growth rates in these markets may not besustainable.
Government financing and economic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g.,
through health technology assessments) or other means of cost control. For additional information on government pricing pressures, see the 
Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints
 section in this Form 10-K. We continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments that could impact our business. If
 trade restrictions or tariffs reduce globaleconomic activity, potential impacts could include declining sales; increased costs; volatility in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan
investments; required increases of our pension funding obligations; increased government cost control efforts; delays or failures in the performance of customers, suppliers and other
third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business; and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts
 may not be adequate.We operate in many countries and transact in over 100 different currencies. Changes in the value of those currencies relative to the
 U.S. dollar, or high inflation in these countries, canimpact our revenues, costs and expenses and our financial guidance. Significant portions of our revenues, costs and expenses
, as well as our substantial international net assets, areexposed to exchange rate changes. 63% of our total 2021 revenues were derived from international operations, including 29% from Europe and 19% 
from China, Japan and the restof Asia. Future changes in exchange rates or economic conditions and the impact they may have on
 our results of operations, financial condition or business are difficult to predict. Foradditional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the 
Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk  section within MD&A. In addition, our borrowing, pension benefit and postretirement benefit obligations and interest-bearing investments, are subject to risk from changes in interest and exchange rates.
The risks related to interest-bearing investments and borrowings and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the 
Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk
 section within MD&A and Note 7E . For additional details on critical accounting estimates and assumptions for our benefit plans, see the Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions—Benefit Plans
 section within MD&A and  Note 11 . From time to time, we issued variable rate debt based on LIBOR, or undertook interest rate swaps tha
t contain a variable element based on LIBOR. The U.K. Financial ConductAuthority announced in 2017 that it will no longer compel banks to submit rates used to calculate LIB
OR after 2021. This deadline was extended until June 2023 for a number of keyU.S. dollar benchmark maturities (including the 1-month and 3-month
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 15 
LIBOR rates). The U.S. Federal Reserve has selected the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) as the preferred alternate rate and the transition away from LIBOR will continuedespite the extended timeline. We are planning for this transition and will amend any contracts to accommodate the SOFR rate
 where required. We do not expect the transition tohave significant impact on our business or financial condition.
PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, SALES AND MARKETING RISKS
We could encounter difficulties or delays in our supply chain, product manufacturing and distribution networks, as well as sales or marketing, due to regulatory actions, shut-downs,
work stoppages or strikes, approval delays, withdrawals, recalls, penalties, supply disruptions, shortages or stock-outs at our facilities or third-party facilities that we rely on,
reputational harm, the impact to our facilities due to health pandemics or natural or man-made disasters, including as a result of climate change, product liability or unanticipated
costs. Examples of such difficulties or delays include the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand; challenges related to component materials to maintain
supply and/or appropriate quality standards throughout our supply network and/or comply with applicable regulations; inability to supply certain products due to voluntary product
recalls (as is the case with Chantix); and supply chain disruptions at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor. In addition, we engage contract manufacturers, and, 
from time to time, ourcontract manufacturers may face difficulties or are unable to manufacture our products at the necessary quantity
 or quality levels.Regulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities, as well as third-party facilities that we rely on, to evaluate compliance with cGMP or other applicable
requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of
product, injunctions, debarment, product recalls, delays or denials of product approvals, import bans or denials of import certifications.
In July and August 2021, Pfizer recalled 16 lots of Chantix in the U.
S. due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline, at or above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit.In September 2021, Pfizer expanded its voluntary recall in the U.S. to include all lots of
 Chantix. We currently also have a voluntary recall across multiple markets and a global pausein shipments of Chantix. Technical solutions are being pursued to reduce nitrosamine levels in Chantix to enable return to market. Nitrosamines are impurities common in water and
foods and everyone is exposed to some level of nitrosamines. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including
Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential for the presence or formation of nitrosamines. This may lead to additional recalls or other market actions for 
Pfizerproducts.
COLLABORATIONS AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES
We depend on third-party collaborators, service providers, and others in the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of our products and product candidates and
also enter into JVs and other business development transactions. To achieve expected longer-term benefits, we may make substantial upfront
 payments as part of these transactions,which may negatively impact our reported earnings or cash flows. We rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development, manufacturing and commercialization
activities, but we do not control many aspects of those activities. We
 also outsource certain services, including activities related to transaction processing, accounting, informationtechnology, manufacturing, clinical trial recruitment and execution, clinical lab services, non-clinical research, safety services, integrated facilities management and other areas.
Failure by one or more of the third-party collaborators, service providers and others to complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations or to meet their
contractual or other obligations to us; failure of one or more of these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations; or any disruption in the relationships between us and these
parties, could delay or prevent the development, approval, manufacturing or commercialization of our products and product candidates, expose us to suboptimal quality of service
delivery or deliverables, result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, erroneous data and supply disruptions, and could also result in non-compliance
with legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards or subject us to reputational harm, all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business. Further, our
Alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co-promotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from
time to time. For information on additional risks specific to our Consumer Healthcare JV, see the 
Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK section  below.COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
Our reputation and promising pipeline render our medicines and vaccines prime targets for counterfeiters. Counterfeit medicines and vaccines pose a significant risk to patient health
and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured—often in unregulated,
 unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites—as well as the lack of regulation of theircontents. Failure to mitigate this threat could adversely impact Pfizer’s patients, potentially causing them harm. This, in turn, may result in 
the loss of patient confidence in the Pfizername and in the integrity of our medicines and vaccines, and potentially impact our business through lost sales, product recalls, and possible litigation.
The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is an industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of e-commerce, which increased during the COVID-19 pandemic,
greatly enhancing consumers’ ability to obtain prescriptions and other medical treatments via the internet in lieu of traditional brick and mortar pharmacies or authorized full-service
internet pharmacies. The internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scams because
 of consumers’ misplaced trust withcertain e-commerce retailers coupled with the anonymity the internet affords counterfeiters. While counterfeiters generally target any medicine or vaccine boasting strong demand, we
have observed heightened counterfeit and fraud attempts to our COVID-19 vaccine, as
 well as other products potentially utilized in the treatment of COVID-19.We consistently invest in an enterprise-wide strategy to aggressively combat counterfeit threats by educating patients and health care providers about 
the risks, investing in innovativetechnologies to detect and disrupt sophisticated internet offers and scams, proactively monitoring and interdicting supply with the help of law enforcement;
 and advising legislators andregulators. However, our efforts and those of others may not be entirely successful, and 
the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase.Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 16 
RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS:PRICING AND R
EIMBURSEMENTU.S. and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls or limitations on patient access to our products or establish prices paid by government entities or
programs for our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies. The adoption of restrictive price controls
in new jurisdictions, more restrictive controls in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue. We expect
pricing pressures will continue globally.
In the U.S., pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to government and public scrutiny and calls for reform, and many of our products are subject
 to increasing pricing pressures as aresult. We expect to see continued focus by the Federal government on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. 
Somestates have implemented, and others are considering, patient access constraints or cost cutting under the
 Medicaid program, and some are considering measures that would apply tobroader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. State legislatures also have continued to focus on addressing drug costs, generally by increasing price
transparency or limiting drug price increases. Measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation, could adversely affect our
business. For additional information on U.S. pricing and reimbursement, see the 
Item 1. Business — Government Regulation and Price Constraints section  in this Form 10-K.We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we operate. In certain markets, such as in EU member states, the U.K., Japan
, China, Canadaand South Korea, governments have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices, access criteria, or impose other means of cost control, particularly as a result of recent
global financing pressures. For example, the QCE and VBP tender process in China has resulted in dramatic price cuts for off-patent
 medicines. For additional information regardingthese government initiatives, see the 
Item 1. Business — Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures in China and elsewhere in the future. In addition, in many countries, with respect to our vaccines, we participate in a tender process for
selection in national immunization programs. Failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely
affect our business. We also anticipate pricing pressures will be amplified by COVID-19 induced budget deficits and focus on pricing for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines.
U.S. HEALTHCARE REGULATION
The U.S. healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. 
Any significant efforts at the U.S. federal or state levels to reform the healthcaresystem by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us. For additional information on U.S. healthcare regulation, see the 
Item 1. Business–– Government Regulation and Price Constraints
 section in this Form 10-K. Other U.S. federal or state legislative or regulatory action and/or policy efforts could adversely affect our business, including, among others,
 general budget control actions, changes inpatent laws, the importation of prescription drugs to the U.S. at prices tha
t are regulated by foreign governments, revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under governmentprograms that could reference international prices or require new discounts, limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals and other industry stakeholders, or the use of
comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among
pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines.
A reduction of U.S. federal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products. Any
other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an
adverse impact on our results of operations.
DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS
The discovery and development of drugs, vaccines and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. The outcome is inherently uncertain and involves a high
degree of risk due to the following factors, among others:
•
The process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years.•
Product candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process, including as the result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, or unfavorable new pre-clinical or clinicaldata and further analyses of existing pre-clinical or clinical data, including results that may not support further clinical development of the product candidate or indication.
•
We may need to amend our clinical trial protocols or conduct additional clinical trials under certain circumstances, for example, to further assess appropriate dosage or collectadditional safety data.
•
We may not be able to meet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for our pre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatory submission dates,regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates.
•
We may not be able to successfully address all the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and the EMA, or be able to obtain approval for new productsand indications from regulators.
Regulatory approvals of our products depend on myriad factors, including regulatory determinations as to the product’s safety and efficacy. In
 the context of public health emergencieslike the COVID-19 pandemic, regulators evaluate various factors and criteria to potentially allow for marketing authorization on an emergency or conditional basis. Additionally, clinical
trial and other product data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities. As a result o
f regulatory interpretations and assessments or otherdevelopments that occur during the review process, and even after a product is authorized or approved for marketing, a product’s commercial potential could be adversely affected by
potential emerging concerns or regulatory decisions regarding or impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters, including decisions relating to
emerging developments regarding potential product impurities.
We may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees, such as the ACIP or any FDA Advisory Committee that
 may be convenedto review our applications such as EUAs, NDAs or BLAs, which may impact the potential marketing and use of our products
. Further, claims and concerns that may arise regarding thesafety and efficacy of in-line products and product candidates can negatively impact product sales, and po
tentially lead to product recalls or withdrawals, including regulator-directedrisk evaluations and
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 17 
assessments, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Further regulatory agency requirements may result in a more challenging, expensive and lengthyregulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for, among other things, additional or more extensive clinical trials prior to granting approval, or increased post-approval
requirements. For these and other reasons discussed in this Risk Factors section, we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the 
timeframe we anticipate, or at all.POST-AUTHORIZATION/APPROVAL DATA
As a condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of a product, the FDA may require additional clinical trials or other studies. The results generated in these trials could
result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects, ef
ficacy or safety. Regulatory agencies in countries outside theU.S. often have similar regulations and may impose comparable requirements. Post-marketing studies and clinical trials, whether conducted by us or by others, whether mandated by
regulatory agencies or conducted voluntarily, and other emerging data about products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect
 the availability or commercialpotential of our products. Further, if safety or efficacy concerns are raised about a
 product in the same class as one of our products, those concerns could implicate the entire class;and this, in turn, could have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our product(s) as well as other products in the class. The potential regulatory and
commercial implications of post-marketing study results typically cannot immediately be determined. For example, in December 2021, in light of the results from the completed
required postmarketing safety study of Xeljanz, ORAL Surveillance (A3921133), the U.S. label for Xeljanz was revised. Updates include a new boxed
 warning for major adversecardiovascular events (MACE) and updated boxed warnings regarding mortality, malignancies and thrombosis (with corresponding updates to applicable warnings and precautions).
In addition, indications for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA or active 
PsA, and patients who are two years of age and older with active polyarticular coursejuvenile idiopathic arthritis have been revised; Xeljanz is now indicated in patients who have had inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor blockers. In
addition, at the request of the EC, the
 PRAC of the EMA has adopted a referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to assess safety information relating tooral JAK inhibitors authorized for inflammatory diseases, including Xeljanz and Cibinqo, which is ongoing. We continue to work with regulatory agencies to review the full results and
analyses of ORAL Surveillance and their impact on product labeling.
The terms of our EUA for Comirnaty require that we conduct post-authorization observational studies in patients at least 5 years o
f age or older who received a booster dose, or otherpopulations of interest including healthcare workers, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and subpopulations with specific comorbidities. Additionally, in relation to the
FDA approval for Comirnaty, we are required to complete certain postmarketing study requirements and commitments by 2024 as identified in the August 2021 approval letter. The
terms of our EUA for Paxlovid require monitoring for convergence of global viral variants of SARS-CoV-2 and potential assessment of Paxlovid activity against identified global
variants of interest. Additionally, in relation to the potential FDA approval for Paxlovid, we are required to complete certain other analyses and studies as
 identified in the December2021 authorization letter.
LEGAL MATTERS
We are and may be involved in various legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, including personal injury, consumer, off-label
promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, commercial and other asserted and unasserted matters, environmental, government investigations, employment, tax
litigation and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur.
Although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, we could in the 
future incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise ourexpectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on
 our results of operations.Claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. There can be no assurance as
 to the outcome of thesematters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of pa
tent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and couldmaterially affect future results of operations.
Government investigations and actions could result in substantial fines and/or criminal charges and civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable
jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions, as well as reputational harm, including as a result of increased public interest in the
matter. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the
 recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of thegovernment.
Our sales and marketing activities and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the FCP
A and otherfederal and state statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as the Anti-Kickback S
tatute, anti-bribery laws, the False Claims Act, and similar laws ininternational jurisdictions. In addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws, the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation, settlement
precedent, advisory opinions, and special fraud alerts. Our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types of
 developments. Requirements or industrystandards in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare
providers and can increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions. If an interaction is found to be improper, government enforcement actions and penalties
could result. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time-to-time received, and may receive in the future, inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information
demands from government authorities. In addition, we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities, brought
 by governmental authorities, as well asconsumers and private payers. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and other adverse consequences as a result of
 these claims, actionsand inquiries. Such claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged non-compliance with laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product (approved and
unapproved) information, potentially resulting in government enforcement action and reputational damage. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including social media,
mobile applications and blogger outreach.
In connection with the resolution of a U.S. government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that
 provide financial assistance to Medicare patients, in2018, we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of
 the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is effective for aperiod of five years. In the CIA, we agreed to implement and/or maintain certain compliance program elements to promote compliance with federal healthcare program requirements.
Breaches of the CIA could result in severe sanctions against us.
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 18 
We and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to legal claims and proceedings, includingenvironmental contingencies. Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and
can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. While we have accrued for worldwide legal liabilities, no guarantee exists that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts
accrued.
For additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in, see 
Note 16A . RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY:
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION
Our success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including
patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protec
t our intellectual property andproprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent
 third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions ofour branded products, from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications
may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not
 be granted on a timely basis, if at all. For example, in May 2021,the Brazilian Supreme Court voted to invalidate Article 40 of Brazil’s Patent Law, which guaranteed a minimum 10-year patent term from patent grant, and
 to give retroactive effect tosuch decision. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us
 against claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term made byparties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area.
Further, legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governments could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or
being restricted from enforcing intellectual property related to our products. Discussions are ongoing at the WTO regarding the role of intellectual property in the context of
 the COVID-19 pandemic response. This includes a proposal that would release WTO members from their obligation under WTO-TRIPS to grant and enforce various types of intellectual property
protection on health products and technology in relation to the prevention, containment or treatment o
f COVID-19. In May 2021 and again in November 2021, the Biden Administrationcalled on countries to waive intellectual property protections on COVID-19 vaccines.
The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our pa
tents depends on the laws of eachcountry, its enforcement practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that
 weaken a country’s intellectual property framework (e.g., laws orregulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license). In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permitting some
form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are
employing aggressive strategies, such as “at risk” launches that challenge our patent rights. Most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that paten
ts covering ourproducts, uses, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the
 generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer. Independent actions have been filed allegingthat our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, pa
tent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claims may also bebrought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents. We are also party to o
ther patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drugmanufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry. We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter
partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European 
Patent Office, or other foreign counterpartsrelating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents
 or a competitors’ patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic orbiosimilar products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For additional information, including information regarding certain legal
proceedings in which we are involved, see 
Note 16A1 . Further, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection,
which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate
 us from our competitorsincreases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting,
 registering or using trademarks and trade dress thatinfringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees,
consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationship with us. Despite
these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third-party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our o
ther intellectual property withoutauthorization, and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, o
thers may independently and lawfully developsubstantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.
THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS
A properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies, but the
patent granting process is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were
improperly granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges may not always be successful.
Part of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which may involve litigation, associated costs
and time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. These opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products
 has expired or beendeclared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In some circumstances we may take action,
 such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringepatents of existing products or that those patents
 are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a “first-to-market” or early market position for our products.Third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consuming to
resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant royalty payments or damages.
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 19 
For example, our R&D in a therapeutic area may not be first and another company or entity may have obtained relevant patents before us. We are involved in patent-related disputeswith third parties over our attempts to market pharmaceutical products. Once we have final regulatory approval of the related products, we may decide to
 commercially market theseproducts even though associated legal proceedings (including any appeals) have not been resolved (i.e., “at-risk” launch). If one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid
patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented
 from further sales of that product. Such damagesmay be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY
Significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. We extensively rely upon sophisticated information
technology systems (including cloud services) to operate our business. We produce, collect, process, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including personal
information and intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such
confidential information. We have outsourced significant elements of our operations, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we
manage relationships with many third-party providers who may or could have access to our confidential information. We rely on technology developed, supplied and/or maintained by
third-parties that may make us vulnerable to “supply chain” style cyber-attacks. Further, technology and security vulnerabilities of acquisitions, business partners or third-party
providers may not be identified during due diligence or soon enough to mitigate exploitation. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems,
and those of our third-party providers (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such systems po
tentially vulnerable to service interruptions orto security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or contingent workers, providers, or malicious attackers. As a global pharmaceutical company, our
systems and assets are the target of frequent cyber-attacks.
 Such cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a widerange of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states and others. Due to the nature of
some of these attacks, there is a risk that they
 may remain undetected for a period of time. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, our effortsmay not prevent service interruptions, extortion, theft of confidential or proprietary information, compromise of data integrity or unauthorized information disclosure. Any such
interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in
financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or
reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.
RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT:
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
We expect to enhance our in-line products and product pipeline through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, JVs, collaborations, equity- or
debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. The success of these activities is dependent on 
the availability and accurate cost/benefit evaluation ofappropriate opportunities, competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions, including the ability
to satisfy closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes or at all, and successfully integrate acquisitions. Pursuing these opportunities may require us to obtain additional equity or
debt financing, which could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings. Where we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for
business development activities, the value of those securities will fluctuate, and may depreciate. We may not control a company in which we invest,
 and, as a result, we will havelimited ability to determine its management, operational decisions and policies. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things,
due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us
, or that we inadequately assess. The success of any of our acquisitions willdepend, when applicable, on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from integrating these businesses with us. We, for example, may fail to achieve cos
t savings anticipated withcertain of these acquisitions, or such cost savings within the expected time frame. Similarly, the accretive impact anticipated from certain of 
these acquisitions may not be realized ormay be delayed. Integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees, 
the disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies instandards, controls, procedures and policies. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue growth for the acquired business. 
Expected revenue from acquired products andproduct candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely
impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates, including those acquired in these acquisitions.
SPIN-OFF AND COMBINATION OF UPJOHN WITH MYLAN
We may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off and
 combination (the Transactions) of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, which resulted in the creation of Viatrisin November 2020, due to many factors, including, among others, strategic adjustments required to reflect the nature o
f our business following the Transactions, increased risksresulting from us becoming a company that is a more focused, innovative science-based biopharmaceutical products business and the possibility that we may not achieve our
strategic objectives. In addition, we have agreed to provide certain transition services to Viatris, generally for an initial period of 24 months following the completion of the Transactions
(with certain possibilities for extension). These obligations under the transition services agreements may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into
maintaining or growing our business.
CONSUMER HEALTHCARE JV WITH GSK
In 2019, we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a JV that
 operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. Although we havecertain consent, board representation and other governance rights, we are a minority owner of the JV and do not
 control the JV, its management or its policies. As a result, our abilityto realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction depend upon G
SK’s operation and management of the JV. In addition, the JV is subject to risks that are different than the risksassociated with our business. Many of these risks are outside GSK’s or the JV’s control and could materially impact the business, 
financial condition and results of operations of theJV.
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 20 
In June 2021, GSK announced that it intends to demerge at least 80% of its 68% ownership interest in the JV in mid-2022, subject to GSK shareholder approval. Following thedemerger, the JV is expected to be an independent, listed company on the
 London Stock Exchange with American Depositary Receipts to be listed in the U.S., in which Pfizer wouldinitially hold a 32% ownership interest and GSK may hold up to a 13.6% ownership interest. Notwithstanding GSK’s announcement,
 the demerger may not be completed withinexpected time periods or at all, and both the timing and success of the demerger (or any other separation and public listing transaction), will be subject to prevailing market conditions
and other factors at the time of such transaction. 
Any future distribution or sale of our stake in the JV will similarly be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at thetime of such transaction. Our ability to complete any such future distribution or sale may also be impacted by the
 size of our retained stake at the time. The uncertainty relating to anyseparation and public listing transactions (including the announced demerger), their implementation, their timing and their yet to be determined effects on the JV’s business may
subject us and the JV to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affec
t our business and financial results.GENERAL RISKS:
COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Our business, operations and financial condition and results have been and may continue to be impacted by the CO
VID-19 pandemic to varying degrees. The pandemic haspresented a number of risks and challenges for our business, including, among others: impacts due to travel limitations and mobility restrictions; manufacturing disruptions and delays;
supply chain disruptions and shortages, including challenges related to reliance on third-party suppliers resulting in reduced availability of materials or components used in the
development, manufacturing, distribution or administration of our products; disruptions to pipeline development and clinical trials, including difficulties or delays in enrolling certain
clinical trials, retaining clinical trial participants, accessing needed supplies, and accruing a sufficient number of cases in certain clinical trials; decreased product demand, due to
reduced numbers of in-person meetings with prescribers, patient visits with physicians, vaccinations and elective surgeries, resulting in fewer new prescriptions or refills of existing
prescriptions and reduced demand for products used in procedures; reduced product demand as a result of unemployment or increased focus on COVID-19 vaccination; challenges
presented by reallocating personnel and R&D, manufacturing and other resources to assist in responding to the pandemic; costs associated with the CO
VID-19 pandemic, includingpractices intended to reduce the risk of transmission, increased supply chain costs and additional R&D costs incurred in our efforts to develop a vaccine to
 help prevent COVID-19and an oral COVID-19 treatment; challenges related to our business development initiatives, including potential delays or disruptions related to regulatory approvals; interruptions or
delays in the operations of regulatory authorities, which may delay potential approval of new products we are developing, potential label expansions for existing products and the
launch of newly-approved products; challenges operating in a virtual work environment; increased cyber incidents such as phishing, social engineering and malware attacks;
challenges related to our intellectual property, both domestically and internationally, including in response to any pressure or legal or regulatory action that could potentially result in us
not seeking intellectual property protection for, licensing, or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from enforcing, intellectual property rights related to our products, including our
vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 and an oral COVID-19 treatment; challenges related to conducting oversight and monitoring of regulated activities in a remote or virtual
environment; challenges related to our human capital and talent development, including challenges in attracting, hiring and retaining highly skilled and diverse workforce; challenges
related to vaccine mandates; and other challenges presented by disruptions to our normal operations in response to the pandemic, as well as uncertainties regarding the duration and
severity of the pandemic and its impacts, and government or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control the supply o
f medicines and vaccines.We also face risks and uncertainties related to our efforts to develop and commercialize a vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 and an oral COV
ID-19 treatment, as well as challengesrelated to their manufacturing, supply and distribution, including, among others:
•
uncertainties inherent in R&D, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates,regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with pre-clinical and clinical data (including the Phase 1/2/3 or Phase 4 data for BNT162b2 or any other
vaccine candidate in the BNT162 program or Paxlovid or any other future COVID-19 treatment) in any of our studies in pediatrics, adolescents or adults
 or real world evidence,including the possibility of unfavorable new pre-clinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing pre-clinical, clinical or safety data or further information regarding the
quality of pre-clinical, clinical or safety data, including by audit or inspection;
•
the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results for BNT162b2 or Paxlovid, including the rate of effectiveness and/or efficacy, safety and tolerability profile observed todate, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial for BNT162b2 or Paxlovid and additional studies, in real-world data studies or in larger, more diverse populations following
commercialization;
•
the ability of BNT162b2 or any future vaccine to prevent, or Paxlovid or any other future COVID-19 treatment to be effective against, COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants;•
the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine or Paxlovid will lead to new information about efficacy, safety or other developments, including the risk of additional adversereactions, some of which may be serious;
•
the risk that pre-clinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientificcommunity generally, and by regulatory authorities;
•
whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program, Paxlovid or other programs will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and withwhat modifications and interpretations;
•
whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future pre-clinical and clinical studies;•
whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for BNT162b2 or any potential future vaccines in additional populations, for abooster dose for BNT162b2 or any potential future vaccines (including potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations), and/or biologics license and/or EUA applications or
amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for BNT162b2 or any other potential vaccines, and if obtained, whether or when such EUA or licenses
will expire or terminate;
•
whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for Paxlovid or any other future COVID-19 treatment and/or any drug applicationsfor any indication for Paxlovid or any other future COVID-19 treatment may be filed in any jurisdiction, and if obtained, whether or when such
 EUA or licenses will expire orterminate;
•
whether and when any application that may be pending or filed for BNT162b2 or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program, Paxlovid or any other future COVID-19treatment or any other COVID-19 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to
whether the vaccine’s or drug’s benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine’s or drug’s efficacy and, if approved, whether it will be commercially successful;
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 21 
•decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential ofa vaccine or drug, including development of products or therapies by other companies;
•
disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners, clinical trial sites or third-party suppliers, including our relationship with BioNTech;•
the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products;•
the risk that demand for any products may be reduced or no longer exist;•
the possibility that COVID-19 will diminish in severity or prevalence, or disappear entirely;•
risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture or test any such products;•
challenges related to our vaccine’s formulation, dosing schedule and attendant storage, distribution and administration requirements, including risks related to storage and handlingafter delivery by us;
•
the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations, booster doses or potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations or new variant-specificvaccines;
•
the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts;•
risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide research funding for the BNT162 program, Paxlovid or any other COVID-19 program;•
challenges and risks associated with the pace of our development programs;•
the risk that we may not be able to maintain or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or maintain access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with globaldemand for our vaccine or any treatment for COVID-19, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine or 
treatment courses ofPaxlovid within the projected time periods;
•
whether and when additional supply or purchase agreements will be reached;•
uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine or treatment advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertaintiesregarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations;
•
pricing and access challenges for such products;•
challenges related to public confidence or awareness of our COVID-19 vaccine or Paxlovid, including challenges driven by misinformation, access, concerns about clinical dataintegrity and prescriber and pharmacy education;
•
trade restrictions;•
potential third-party royalties or other claims related to our COVID-19 vaccine or Paxlovid; and•
competitive developments.Further, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could precipitate or amplify the other risks that we identify in this Risk
Factors section, which could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition and results.
We are continuing to monitor the latest developments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business,
 operations and financial condition and results, and havemade certain assumptions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections, including assumptions regarding the duration,
severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic, as well as COVID-19 vaccine and oral COVID-19 treatment supply and contracts, which remain dynamic. Despite
careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of
 the pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results due to theuncertainty of future developments. In particular, we believe the ultimate impact on our business, operations and financial condition and results will be affected by
 the speed andextent of the continued spread of the coronavirus globally, the emergence of additional virus variants, the duration o
f the pandemic, new information regarding the severity andincidence of COVID-19, the safety, efficacy and availability of vaccines and treatments
 for COVID-19, the rate at which the population becomes vaccinated against COVID-19, theglobal macroeconomic impact of the pandemic and governmental or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control supply of medicines and vaccines. The pandemic may also affect
our business, operations or financial condition and results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not
 consider as presenting significant risks.MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS
Changes in fair value of certain equity investments need to be recognized in net income that may result in increased volatility of our income. For additional information, see 
Note 4 and the 
Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&A. Our pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations are subject to volatility from changes in fair value of equity investments and other investment
 risk in the assetsfunding these plans. For additional information, see the 
Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Benefit Plans section within MD&A and 
Note 11. COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL AND NONORDINARY EVENTS
Growth in costs and expenses, changes in product and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internal reorganizations, product withdrawals,
recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future
results. Such risks and uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to realize the projected benefits of our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, other corporate strategic
initiatives and any acquisitions, divestitures or other initiatives, as well as potential disruption of ongoing business.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS
Our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including IPR&D and goodwill. For IPR&D assets, 
the risk of failure is significant, and there can beno certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. Our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often
 contingent upon, among other things,regulatory approvals and market acceptance. As such, we expect that many of 
these IPR&D assets will become impaired and/or be written off at some time in the future if theassociated R&D effort is abandoned or is curtailed. For goodwill, all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a
 goodwill impairment charge such as,among other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 22 
business climate and/or a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity. Our other intangible assets, including developed technology rights and brands, facesimilar risks for impairment. Our equity-method investments may also be subject to impairment charges that may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or
management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these
 investments. We may recognize impairment charges as a result of a weakeconomic environment, events related to particular customers or asset types, challenging market conditions or decisions by management. Any such impairment charge of our
intangible assets, goodwill and equity-method investments may be significant. For additional details, see the S
ignificant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
 section within MD&A. CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, including, among others, changes in accounting standards,
 tax laws andregulations internationally and in the U.S. (including, among other things, any potential adoption of global minimum taxation requirements and any potential changes to existing tax law
and regulations by the Biden Administration and Congress), competition laws, privacy laws and environmental laws in the U.S. and other countries. For additional information on
changes in tax laws or rates or accounting standards, see the 
Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income and  New Accounting Standards sections within MD&A and Note 1B . ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES We own and lease space globally for sales and marketing, customer service, regulatory compliance, R&D, manufacturing and distribution and corporate enabling functions. In many
locations, our business and operations are co-located to achieve synergy and operational efficiencies. Our global headquarters are located in New York City. We continue to advance
our global workplace strategy to provide workplaces that enable collaboration and foster innovation. As of December 31, 2021, we had 327 owned and leased properties, amounting
to approximately 41 million square feet.
We expect to relocate our global headquarters to the Spiral, an office building in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City,
 with occupancy expected beginning in the secondhalf of 2022. In April 2018, we entered into an agreement to lease space
 at this property. In July 2018, we completed the sale of our current headquarters in New York City. Weremain in a lease-back arrangement with the buyer while we complete our relocation.
Our PGS platform function is headquartered in various locations, with leadership teams primarily in New York City and in Peapack, New Jersey. As of December 31, 2021, PG
S hadresponsibility for 39 plants around the world, including in Belgium, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Singapore and the U.S.
, which manufacture products for our business. PGSexpects to exit three of these sites over the nex
t several years. PGS also operates multiple distribution facilities around the world.In general, we believe that our properties, including the principal properties described above, are well-maintained, adequate and suitable for their current requirements and for our
operations in the foreseeable future. See

 section within MD&A. References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part o
f ourbusiness, they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign
exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.
Our Business and Strategy
Most of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. With the formation of 
the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our formerUpjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products
worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global
structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and PC1. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. On December 31, 2021,
 we completed the sale of our Meridiansubsidiary, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period
information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure. See 
Note 1A and  Item 1. Business––Commercial Operations of this Form 10-K for additional information. We expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which, approximately 75% has been incurred since inception and through December
31, 2021. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and 
transaction costs.Transforming to a More Focused Company: 
We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base and support model align appropriately with our new operating structure. While certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off
, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. We aretaking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&D and PGS plat
form functions. In addition, we are transforming our commercialgo-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. See the 
Costs and Expenses––Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost- Reduction/Productivity Initiatives 
section of this MD&A . R&D:
 We believe we have a strong pipeline and are well-positioned for future growth. R&D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the
 most impactful for patients. Innovation, drug discovery and development are critical toour success. In addition to discovering and developing new
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 26 
products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications. See the Item 1. Business
— Research and Development section  of this Form 10-K for our R&D priorities and strategy.We seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:
•
an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients’ unmet needs;•
advances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines; and•
the increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems.Our Business Development Initiatives
We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also
through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities
and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and
 our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular,ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.
Our significant recent business development activities that closed or are targeted to close in 2022 include:
Acquisition of Arena
In December 2021, we and Arena announced that the companies entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Arena, a clinical stage company developing
innovative potential therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire all outstanding shares of Arena for $100
per share in an all-cash transaction for a total equity value of approximately $6.7 billion. On February 2, 2022, Arena shareholders voted to approve 
the proposed acquisition, which istargeted to close in the first half of 2022, subject 
to review under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions.Collaboration with Biohaven
In November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd., Biohaven
Pharmaceutical Ireland DAC and BioShin Limited (collectively, Biohaven) pursuant to which we acquired rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and
prevention of migraines outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. Rimegepant is currently commercialized in the U.S., Israel, and the U.
A.E. under the brand name NurtecODT, with certain additional applications pending outside of the U.S. Biohaven will continue to lead R&D globally and we have the exclusive right to commercialization globally,
outside of the U.S. Upon the closing of the 
transaction, which occurred on January 4, 2022, we paid Biohaven $500 million, including an upfront payment of $150 million and an equityinvestment of $350 million. Biohaven is also eligible to receive up to $740 million in non-U.S. commercialization milestone payments, in addition to tiered double-digit royalties on net
sales outside of the U.S. In addition to the
 milestone payments and royalties above, we will also reimburse Biohaven for the portion of certain additional milestone payments androyalties due to third parties in accordance with preexisting Biohaven agreements, which are attributed to ex-U.S. sales.

Note 2 . Our 2021 Performance
Revenues
Revenues
 increased $39.6 billion, or 95%, to $81.3 billion in 2021 from $41.7 billion in 2020, reflecting an operational increase of $38.4 billion, or 92%, as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.2 billion, or 3%. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues of Comirnaty and sales of Paxlovid, revenues increased 6% operationally, reflecting strong
growth in Eliquis, Biosimilars, PC1, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, the Hospital therapeutic area, Inlyta and Xtandi, partially offset by
 declines in the Prevnar family, Chantix/Champix, Enbreland Sutent.
The following outlines the components of the net change in revenues:

Income from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on IncomeThe increase in 
Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income  of $17.3 billion in 2021, compared to 2020, was primarily attributable to: (i) higher revenues, (ii) net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in 2020, (iii) lower asset impairment charges, and (iv) higher net gains on equity securities, partially
offset by (v) increases in: 
Cost of sales, Research and development expenses and  Selling, informational and administrative expenses.See
 the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income within MD&A and Note 4  for additional information. For information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the 
Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income  section within MD&A and Note 5 . Our Operating Environment
We, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below. See also the 
Item 1. Business–– Government Regulation and Price Constraints
 and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections of this Form 10-K. Regulatory Environment––Pipeline Productivity
Our product lines must be replenished to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends,
 as well as to providefor earnings growth. As a result, we devote considerable resources to our R&D activities which, while essential to our growth, incorporate a high degree of risk and cost, including
whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be
successful commercially. We conduct clinical trials to provide data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of a
 product’s overall benefit-risk profile for a particular patientpopulation. In addition, after a product has been approved or authorized and launched, we continue 
to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients. This includespostmarketing trials that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the product,
 we collect safety dataand report safety information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may evaluate potential safety
 concerns and take regulatory actions in response, suchas updating a product’s labeling, restricting its use, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, requiring us to suspend or remove a product from the
market. The commercial potential of in-line products may be negatively impacted by post-marketing developments.
Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights
The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a
material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years,
and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact o
f reducedrevenues due to patent expiries from 2022 through 2025. We continue to vigorously defend our paten
t rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts thatstrengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.
For additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the 
Item 1. Business––Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights  section in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see 
Note 16A1. Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access––Government and Other Payer Group Pressures
The pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be important to
payers, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. Federal and state governments and private third-party payers in the U.
S. continue to take action to manage the utilization ofdrugs and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or
favorable formulary placement. We consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines and vaccines. Within the U.S., we often engage
 with patients, doctors andhealthcare plans. We also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers, including PBMs and MCOs. The price that patients
 pay in the U.S. for prescribed medicinesand vaccines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. Governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs, including proposing pricing reform or
legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access,
“international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP.
 In the U.S., we expect to seecontinued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, there
is proposed legislation that, if enacted, would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for certain prescription drugs, as well as require that penalties be paid by manufacturers who raise
drug prices faster than inflation. Also, certain changes proposed by the CMS in December 2020 to the Medicaid program and 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on
prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities, could increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and increase the discounts we extend to
340B covered entities if they go into effect. 
Additional changes to the 340B program are undergoing review and their status is unclear. We anticipate that these and similar initiativeswill continue to increase pricing pressures globally. For additional information, see the 
Item 1. Business –– Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and –– Government Regulation and Price Constraints
 sections in this Form 10-K. Product Supply
We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions or shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls such as our recent Chantix recall. For information on our recent Chantix
recall and risks related to product manufacturing, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors––Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks  section in this Form 10-K. The Global Economic Environment
In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent
 of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. Certain factors in theglobal economic environment that may impact our global operations include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, global economic conditions
including inflation, restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property, legal protections and remedies, trade regulations, tax laws and regulations and procedures and
actions affecting approval,
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 28 
production, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action, including the current conflictbetween Russia and Ukraine, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems, inter-governmental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, natural
disasters or disruptions related to climate change. Government pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting
prices, access criteria or other means of cost control.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business, operations and financial condition and results.
Our Response to COVID-19
Pfizer has helped lead the global effort to confront the COV
ID-19 pandemic by advancing a vision for industry-wide collaboration while making significant investments in breakthroughscience and global manufacturing.
•
Comirnaty/BNT162b2: ◦
We have collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty/BNT162b2, a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent COVID-19. The FDA has approved Comirnatyin the U.S. to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older as a two-dose primary series (30 µg per dose). Comirnaty is the first COVID-19 vaccine to
 be grantedapproval by the FDA and had previously been available to this patient population in the U.S. under an 
EUA since December 2020. The vaccine is also available to individuals 5 to15 years old under an EUA granted by the FDA in 2021 (10 µg per dose for children 5 through 11
 years of age (October 2021) and 30 µg per dose for individuals 12 years of ageand older (May 2021)). The FDA has also authorized for emergency use: (i) a third dose of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 in certain immunocompromised individuals 5 years of age and
older and (ii) Comirnaty/BNT162b2 as a booster dose in individuals 12 years of age and older. Comirnaty/BNT162b2 has also been granted an approval or an authorization in
many other countries around the world in populations varying by country. We continue to evaluate our vaccine, including for additional pediatric indications, and the short- and
long-term efficacy of Comirnaty. We are also studying vaccine candidates to potentially prevent COVID-19 caused by new and emerging variants, such as the
 Omicron variant, oran updated vaccine as needed.
◦
In 2021, we manufactured more than three billion doses and, in fiscal 2021, delivered 2.2 billion doses around the world. Pfizer and BioNTech expect we can manufacture up tofour billion doses in total by the end of 2022. The companies have entered into agreements to
 supply pre-specified doses of Comirnaty in 2022 with multiple developed andemerging countries around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of Comirnaty to governments under such agreements. We also signed agreements with multiple
countries to supply Comirnaty doses in 2023 and are currently negotiating similar potential agreements with multiple other countries. We anticipate delivering at least two billion
doses to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022—one billion that was delivered in 2021 and one billion expected to be delivered in 2022, with the possibility to
increase those deliveries if more orders are placed by these countries for 2022. One billion of the aforementioned doses to low- and middle-income countries are being supplied
to the U.S. government at a not-for-profit price to be donated
 to the world’s poorest nations at no charge to those countries.◦
As of February 8, 2022, we forecasted approximately $32 billion in revenues for Comirnaty in 2022, with gross profit to be split evenly with BioNTech, which includes dosesexpected to be delivered in fiscal 2022 under contracts signed as of late-January 2022.
•
Paxlovid: ◦
In December 2021, the FDA authorized the emergency use of Paxlovid, a novel oral COVID-19 treatment, which is a SARS-CoV2-3CL protease inhibitor and is co-administeredwith a low dose of ritonavir, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40
 kg [88 lbs]) withpositive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. The FDA based its decision
on clinical data from the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients), which enrolled non-hospitalized adults aged 18 and older
with confirmed COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illness. Paxlovid has been granted an authorization or approval in many other countries.
◦
We continue to evaluate Paxlovid in other populations, including in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at standard risk (i.e., low risk ofhospitalization or death) (Phase 2/3 EPIC-SR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard Risk Pa
tients)) and in adults living in the same household as someonewith a confirmed COVID-19 infection (Phase 2/3 EPIC-PEP (Evaluation of Protease
 Inhibition for COVID-19 in Post-Exposure Prophylaxis)).◦
We have entered into agreements with multiple countries to supply pre-specified courses of Paxlovid, such as the U.S. and U.K., and have initiated bilateral outreach toapproximately 100 countries around the world. Additionally, we have signed a voluntary non-exclusive license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) for Paxlovid.
Under the terms of the agreement, MPP can grant sublicenses to qualified generic medicine manufacturers worldwide to manufacture and supply Paxlovid to 95 low- and middle-
income countries, covering up to approximately 53% of the world’s population.
◦
Pfizer plans to manufacture up to 120 million treatment courses by the end of 2022, depending on the global need, which will be driven by advance purchase agreements, with 30million courses expected to be produced in the first half of 2022 and the remaining 90 million courses expected to be produced in the second half
 of 2022.◦
As of February 8, 2022, we forecasted approximately $22 billion of revenues for Paxlovid in 2022, which includes treatment courses expected to be delivered in fiscal 2022,primarily relating to supply contracts signed or committed as of late-January 2022.
•
IV Protease Inhibitor:◦
In February 2022, we discontinued the global clinical development program for PF-07304814, an intravenously administered SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor beingevaluated in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19. This decision was made based on a totality of information, including a careful review of early data and a thorough
assessment of the candidate’s potential to successfully fulfill patient needs. Dosing of PF-07304814 in 
the National Institutes of Health’s ongoing Accelerating COVID-19Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)-3 study has ceased.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business and Operations
As part of our on-going monitoring and assessment, we have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections,
including assumptions regarding the duration, severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic,
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 29 
as well as COVID-19 vaccine and oral COVID-19 treatment supply and contracts, which remain dynamic. Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predictthe extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business,
 operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. We are focused on all aspectsof our business and are implementing measures aimed at mitigating issues where possible, including by using digital technology to assist in operations for our commercial,
manufacturing, R&D and corporate enabling functions globally.
Apart from our introduction of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and Paxlovid, our business and operations have been impacted by the pandemic in various ways. Our portfolio of products
experienced varying impacts from the pandemic in 2021. For example, certain of our vaccines such as the Prevnar family were impacted by disruptions to healthcare activity related to
COVID-19, including the prioritization of primary and booster vaccination campaigns for COVID-19. For some products such as Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, we continued to see
postponement of elective and diagnostic procedures in 2021 due to COVID-19, which may subside in 2022 as COVID-19 vaccination and boos
ter rates continue to increase and/or ifCOVID-19 cases subside. On the other hand, some products such as 
Ibrance saw accelerating demand in 2021 as the delays in diagnosis and treatment initiations caused by theCOVID-19 pandemic show signs of recovery across several international markets. For detail on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our products, see 
the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Revenues by Geography 
and  Revenues—Selected Product Discussion sections within this MD&A. In 2021, engagement with healthcare professionals started to return to pre-pandemic levels and we continue to review and assess epidemiological data to inform in-person
engagements with healthcare professionals and to help ensure the safety of our colleagues, customers and communities. As part o
f our commitment to engaging our customers in themanner they prefer, we are also taking a hybrid approach of virtual and in person engagements and saw customer response to both approaches. During the pandemic, we adapted
our promotional platform by amplifying our digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers to provide critical education and information, including increasing the
scale of our remote engagement. Most of our colleagues who are able to perform their job functions outside of our facilities continue to
 temporarily work remotely, while certaincolleagues in the PGS and WRDM organizations continue to work onsite and are subject to strict protocols intended to
 reduce the risk of transmission. As of December 31, 2021,more than 96% of our U.S. employee population had been fully vaccinated or received an approved exception. Also, in 2021
 and to date, we have not seen a significant disruption toour supply chain, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels. However, we are seeing an increase in overall demand in the industry
for certain components and raw materials potentially constraining available supply, which could have a future impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement
mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the
extent possible. Certain of our clinical trials were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, which included, in some cases, challenges related to recruiting clinical trial participants
and accruing cases in certain studies. Our clinical trials also progressed in this challenging environment through innovation, such as decentralized visits (e.g., telemedicine and home
visits) to accommodate participants’ ability to maintain scheduled visits, as well as working with suppliers to manage the shortage of certain clinical supplies.
We will continue to pursue efforts to maintain the continuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic. Future developments could result in
additional favorable or unfavorable impacts on our business, operations or financial condition and results. If we experience significant disruption in our manufacturing or supply chains
or significant disruptions in clinical trials or other operations, or if demand for our products is significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience a
material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition and results.
For additional information, please see the
 Item 1A. Risk Factors—COVID-19 Pandemic  section of this Form 10-K. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
Following is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. Also, see 
Note 1D . For a description of our significant accounting policies, see 
Note 1 . Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments: Acquisitions (
Note 1E ); Fair Value ( Note 1F ); Revenues ( Note 1H ); Asset Impairments ( Note 1M
); Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies (Note 1Q ); Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans ( Note 1R ); and Legal and Environmental Contingencies ( Note 1S
).For a discussion of a recently adopted accounting standard and a change in accounting principle related to our pension and postretirement plans, see 
Notes 1B and  1C.Acquisitions
We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognizedat their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. For further detail on acquisition accounting, see 
Note 1E . Historically, intangible assets have been the most significant fair values within our business combinations. For further information on our process to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, see 
Asset Impairments  below. Revenues
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the
 revenues are recognized. Such variableconsideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and
judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect ac
tualresults or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues.
 Product-specific rebates, however, can have asignificant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate
estimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The potential of our estimates 
to vary (sensitivity) differs by program, product, type of customer andgeographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the
extensive time delay
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 30 
between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate settlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because of this lag, our recording of adjustments to reflect actualamounts can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters. Rebate accruals are product specific and, therefore for any period, are impacted by the mix of products sold as well as the
forecasted channel mix for each individual product. For further information, see the 
Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income––Revenue Deductions  section within MD&A and 
Note 1H. Asset Impairments
We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually
and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the
fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in 
Note 1M. Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:
•
A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rights would likelyresult in generic competition earlier than expected.
•
A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such as a restriction imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities that could affect our ability tomanufacture or sell a product.
•
An expectation of losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in aninability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that impacts projected revenue growth, as well
as the lack of acceptance of a product by patients
, physicians and payers. For IPR&D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based on clinical trialdata, a delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product.
Identifiable Intangible Assets
We use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of intangible assets, o
ther than goodwill. We start with a forecast of all theexpected net cash flows associated with the asset, which incorporates the consideration of a 
terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specific discountrate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the
 more significant estimates and assumptions that impact our fair value estimates include: the amount and timing of theprojected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections and the
 impact of technological advancements and riskassociated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount
 rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; andthe tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic origin of the projected cash flows.
While all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, those that are most
 at risk of impairment include IPR&D assets(approximately $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2021) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain
nature of R&D. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently
measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period. As such, immediately after acquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for
these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.
Goodwill
Our goodwill impairment review work as of December 31, 2021 concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this
time.
In our review, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the 
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factorsthat we consider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then
 perform a quantitative fair value test.When we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we typically use the income approach. The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair
value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of
 all the expected net cash flows forthe reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present
 value amount. Some of themore significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expec
ted impact oftechnological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks 
to reflect thevarious risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the
 projected cash flows.For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors tha
t may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequentgoodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the 
Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Result s and the Item 1A. Risk Factors  sections in this Form 10-K.
Benefit Plans
For a description of our different benefit plans, see
 Note 11 . Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made in
determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.

ed with our benefit plans, see Note 11B . Expected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets
The assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect
 our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-looking returnexpectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our 
targeted asset allocation in our respective plans.The expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and
 the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end and theresulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the expec
ted annual rate of return on plan assets, holding allother assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):

Expected annual rate of return on plan assets
50 basis point decline $133 The actual return on plan assets was approximately $2.6 billion during 2021
. Discount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations
The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated
 and modified, as required,to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa
 or better, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectivelysettled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least annually by reference to investment
 grade corporate bonds, ratedAA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a
 yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of local requirements. Themeasurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect the
 amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefit costs inthe following year.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations to a 10 basis point decline in our assumption for 
the discount rate, holding all otherassumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):

 within MD&A for additional analysis
780  124  656  Lower revenues for Chantix/Champix, Enbrel and Sutent:
•
The decrease for Chantix/Champix was driven by the voluntary recall across multiple markets in the second half of2021 and the ongoing global pause in shipments of Chantix due to the presence of N-nitroso-varenicline above an
acceptable level of intake set by various global regulators, the ultimate timing for resolution of which may vary by
country, and the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a decline in patient visits to doc
tors forpreventive health purposes
•
The decrease for Enbrel internationally primarily reflects continued biosimilar competition, which is expected tocontinue
•
The decrease for Sutent primarily reflects lower volume demand in the U.S. resulting from its loss of exclusivity inAugust 2021, as well as continued erosion as a result of increased competition in certain international developed
markets

favorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2%. The operational increase in emerging markets was primarily driven by revenues from Comirnaty and growth from certain
products in the Hospital therapeutic area, Eliquis and PC1, partially offset by a decline from the Prevnar family.

 increase/(decrease) $ 746 $ 1,129 $ (383) Revenues for 2020 included an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately $700 million, or 2%, due to COVID-19, primarily reflecting lower demand for certain products in China
and unfavorable disruptions to wellness visits for patients in the U.S., which negatively impacted prescribing patterns for certain products, partially offset by increased U.S
. demand forcertain sterile injectable products and increased adult uptake for the Prevnar family in certain international markets, resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses,
and U.S. revenues for Comirnaty.
Emerging markets revenues decreased $456 million, or 5%, in 2020 to $8.4 billion, from $8.8 billion in 2019, and were relatively flat operationally, reflecting an unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange of 5% on emerging markets revenues. The relatively flat operational performance was primarily driven by growth from Eliquis, the Prevnar family, Ibrance and
Zavicefta, offset by lower revenues for Consumer Healthcare, reflecting the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction.
Revenue Deductions
Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the
 revenues are recognized. Thesedeductions represent estimates of related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on
 gross sales fora reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have no
t been material to our overall business and generally havebeen less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends.

•
a net increase in upfront payments, mainly related to Myovant and Valneva; and•
increased investments towards building new capabilities and driving automation,partially offset by:
•
a net reduction of upfront and milestone payments associated with the acquisition of Therachon and Akcea in 2019.Amortization of Intangible Assets
2021 v. 2020
Amortization of intangible assets increased $353 million, primarily due to amortization of capitalized Comirnaty sales milestones to BioNTech.
2020 v. 2019
Amortization of intangible assets decreased $1.1 billion, mainly due the non-recurrence of amortization of fully amortized assets and the impairment of Eucrisa in the fourth quarter of
2019, partially offset by the increase in amortization of intangible assets from our acquisition of Array.

For the U.S., the filing date is the date on which the FDA accepted our submission. For the EU, the filing date is the date on which the EMA validated our submission.Being developed in colla
boration with BioNTech. Prior to BLA, Comirnaty/BNT162b2 for ages 16 and up was available in the U.S. pursuant to an EUA from the FDA on December 11, 2020. In December 2021, asupplemental BLA was submitted t
o the FDA requesting to expand the approval of Comirnaty to include individuals ages 12 through 15 years. In February 2022, following a request from the FDA, a rolling submissionseeking to amend the EUA to incl
ude children 6 months through 4 years of age (6 months to <5 years of age) was initiated as we wait for data evaluating a third 3 µg dose given at least two months after the second doseof the two-dose series in this ag
e group. A booster dose received EUA from the FDA on September 22, 2021 for individuals 65 years of age and older, individuals 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19, and individuals 18 thr
ough 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, in October 2021, the FDA authorized for emergency use a booster dose to eligible individualswho have completed primary vacci
nation with a different authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Subsequently, the FDA expanded the booster EUA: (i) in November 2021 to include individuals 18 years of age and older, (ii) inDecember 2021 to include ind
ividuals 16 years of age and older and (iii) in January 2022 to include individuals 12 years of age and older as well as individuals 5 through 11 years of age who have been determined to havecertain kinds of immunocompromise. A 
booster dose received conditional marketing authorization from the EMA in October 2021 for individuals 18 years of age and older and may be given to individuals 5 years and olderwith a severely weakened immun
e system, at least 28 days after their second dose. A booster dose received approval in Japan in November 2021 for 18 years of age and older.Being developed in colla

o recommend Prevnar 20 for routine use in adults. Specifically, the ACIP voted to recommend the following: (i) adults 65 years of age or older who have not previously received apneumococcal conjugate v
accine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV20) or pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV1
5)). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23); and (ii) adults aged 19 years of age or older with certain underlying medicalconditions or other risk factors who 
have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 orPCV15). If PCV15 is used, this should b

recommendations were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on January 28, 2022. The publication also notes “for adults who have received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) but have notcompleted their recommende
d pneumococcal vaccine series with PPSV23, one dose of Prevnar 20 may be used if PPSV23 is not available.”In December 2021, the FDA auth
orized the emergency use of Paxlovid for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg [88 lbs]) withpositive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testin
g, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. In January 2022, the EMA approved the CMA of Paxlovid for treatingCOVID-19 in adults who do not re
quire supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of the disease becoming severe.Under a commercialization arran
gement with Biohaven.In September 2021, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication (DSC) related to Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR and two competitors’ arthritis medicines in the same drug class, based on its
completed review of the ORAL Surveillance trial. The DSC stated that the FDA will require revisions to the Boxed Warnings for each of
 these medicines to include information aboutthe risks of serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots, and death. In addition,
 the DSC indicated the FDA’s intention to limit approved uses of these products to certain patientswho have not responded or cannot tolerate one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. In December 2021, in light of the results from the completed required postmarketing
safety study of Xeljanz, ORAL Surveillance (A3921133), the U.S.
 label for Xeljanz was revised. In addition, at the request of the EC, the PRAC of the EMA has adopted a referralprocedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to assess safety information relating to oral JAK inhibitors authorized for inflammatory diseases, including Xeljanz and
Cibinqo, which is ongoing. For additional information, see

Being developed in collaboration with Spark Therapeutics, Inc.Being developed in collaborat
ion with Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.In February 2022, Pfizer and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA) provided an update on
 the Phase 3 JAVELIN Lung 100 trial, which assessed the safety and efficacy oftwo dosing regimens of avelumab monotherapy compared with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express
PD-L1. While avelumab showed clinical activity in this population, the study did not meet the primary endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival in the high PD-
L1+population for either of the avelumab dosing regimens evaluated. The safety profile for avelumab in this trial was consistent with that
 observed in the overall JAVELIN clinicaldevelopment program. Avelumab is not approved for the treatment of any patients with NSCLC. The outcome o
f the JAVELIN Lung 100 trial has no bearing on any of avelumab’scurrently-approved indications. Full results of the study will be shared at a future date.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, enrollment was stopped in C4591015 Study (a 
Phase 2/3 placebo controlled randomized observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, andimmunogenicity of BNT162b2 against COVID-19 in healthy pregnant women 18 years of age and older). This study was developed prior to availability or recommendation for COVID-
19 vaccination in pregnant women. The environment changed during 2021 and by September 2021, COVID-19 vaccines were recommended by applicable recommending bodies
(e.g., ACIP in the U.S.) for pregnant women in all participating/planned countries, and as a result 
the enrollment rate declined significantly. With the declining enrollment, the study hadinsufficient sample size to assess the primary immunogenicity objective and continuation of this placebo controlled study could no longer be justified due to global recommendations.
This proposal was shared with and agreed to by FDA and EMA.

Item 1. Business — Research and Development section of this Form 10-K. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME
Adjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance in conjunction with other performance measures. As such, we
believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income and Adjusted
diluted EPS to present the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and
 distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide––priorto considering certain income statement elements as follows:

Most directly comparable GAAP measure.
The short-term incentive plans for su
bstantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part by three metrics, one of which is Adjusted dilutedEPS, which is derived from Adjusted incom
e and accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding tied to financial performance. Additionally, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted netincome, which is derived from Adjuste
d income. The bonus pool funding, which is largely based on financial performance, may be modified by our R&D performance as measured by four metrics relating to our pipelineand may be further modified 
by our Compensation Committee’s assessment of other factors.Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAA
P financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limitedin their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to 
the calculation of similar measures of other companies and arepresented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of
 our operations withoutincluding all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitu
tes for theirdirectly comparable GAAP measures of
 Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders , components of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders  and EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders—diluted
, respectively. See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAA P adjusted information—certain line items for 2021, 2020 and 2019 below.
We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these
measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon
 which its effectiveness ismeasured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under
certain of our incentive compensation plans.

Purchase Accounting AdjustmentsAdjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts can include the
incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to 
fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-livedintangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of 
the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair valueof acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. Therefore, the
 Adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquiredproducts without considering the acquisition cost of those products.
The exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our results by providing a degree of parity to
internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs have been expensed. However, we have not factored in the impacts of any
 other differences that might have occurred if wehad discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, such as different R&D costs, 
timelines or resulting sales; accordingly, this approach does not intend to berepresentative of the results that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets internally.
Acquisition-Related Items
Adjusted income excludes acquisition-related items, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations
because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs tha
t were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made noadjustments for resulting synergies.
The significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of
acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the
 context of an acquisition from those costs incurred inother, more normal, business contexts. The integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically
ending within three years of the relevant transaction. Because of the need 
for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring andintegration activities can be lengthy.
Discontinued Operations
Adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We
 believe that this presentation ismeaningful to investors because, while we review our therapeutic areas and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to
discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change 
the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respectof the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.
Certain Significant Items
Adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain
significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although
major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the
business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts
 and circumstancesspecific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the
 date of acquisition. Gains andlosses on equity securities have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and
 because we do not believeincluding these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part
of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not
 expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the 
Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information––Certain Line Items below for a non- inclusive list of certain significant items.
Beginning in 2021, we exclude pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses from our measure of Adjusted income because of their inherent market volatility,
which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists
 investors in understanding our businessor is reflective of our core operations and business.

Operating activities from continuing
operations
$32,922  $10,540 $ 7,015 2021 v. 2020The change was driven primarily by higher net income adjusted for non-cash
 items, the payment for theacquisition of Trillium, a decrease in contributions to pension plans, and the impact o
f timing of receiptsand payments in the ordinary course of business, 
mostly from an increase in cash flows from Othercurrent liabilities driven by: (i) a $9.7 billion accrual for the gross p
rofit split due to BioNTech, (ii) anincrease in royalties payable, as well as (iii) an increase in deferred revenues for
 advance payments in2021 for Comirnaty.
The change in 
Other Adjustments, net , is mostly due to an increase in unrealized gains on equity securities.

ms, advanced paymentsin 2020 for Comirnaty recorded in deferred 
revenue, the upfront cash payment associated with ouracquisition of Therachon in 2019, and the upfront cash paymen
t associated with our licensingagreement with Akcea in 2019, partially offset by an increase in bene
fit plan contributions.The change also reflects the impact of timing of 
receipts and payments in the ordinary course ofbusiness.
The change in 
Other adjustments, net was driven primarily by an increase in equity method dividends received, partially offset by an increase in equity income and increases in ne
t unrealized gains onequity securities.

The change was driven mostly by a $6.0 billion decrease in net proceeds fro
m short-term investmentswith original maturities of three months or less and $2
.7 billion in net purchases of short-terminvestments with original maturities of greater than 
three months in 2020 (compared to $2.3 billion netproceeds from short-term invest
ments with original maturities of greater than three months in 2019),partially offset by the cash used to acquire Array
, net of cash acquired, of $10.9 billion in 2019.Financing activities from continuing
operations
$(9,816) $ (21,640) $ (8,485) 2021 v. 2020The change was driven mostly by a $9.8 billion net reduction in repayments o
f short-term borrowingswith maturities of greater than three

-term borrowings in 2020(compared to $10.6 billion net proceeds raised from
 short-term borrowings in 2019) and an increase incash dividends paid of $397 million, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of
 common stock of$8.9 billion, lower repayments on long-term debt of $2
.8 billion, and an increase in issuances of long-term debt of $280 million.
Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations
Cash flows from discontinued operations primarily relate to our former Meridian subsidiary, Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration (see 
Note 2B ).  In 2020, net cashprovided by financing activities from discontinued operations primarily reflects issuances of long-term debt
. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK
Due to our significant operating cash flows, which is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source, as well as our financial assets, access to
capital markets, revolving credit agreements, and available lines of credit, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing
operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future.
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 45 
We focus efforts to optimize operating cash flows through achieving working capital efficiencies that target accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and other workingcapital. Excess cash from operating cash flows is invested in money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities which consist of primarily high-quality, highly liquid, well-
diversified debt securities. We have taken, and will continue to take, a conservative approach to our financial investments and monitoring of our liquidity position in response to market
changes. We typically maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments which, together with our available revolving credit facilities, are in excess of our
commercial paper and other short-term borrowings.
Additionally, we may obtain funding through short-term or long-term sources from our access to the capital markets, banking relationships and relationships with other financial
intermediaries to meet our liquidity needs.

 2020, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
 in this MD&A. In August 2021, we completed a public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured sustainability notes. We are using the ne
t proceeds to finance orrefinance, in whole or in part as follows: R&D expenses related to our COVID-19 vaccines, capital expenditures in connection with the manufacture and distribution of CO
VID-19vaccines and our other projects that have environmental and/or social benefits. For additional information, see
 Note 7D . Credit Ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and increases or decreases in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing. Our long-
term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s. In November 2020, upon the
 completion of the Upjohn separation, both Moody’s and S&P lowered our long-term debt ratingone notch to ‘A2’ and ‘A+’, respectively, and our short-term rating remained unchanged. S&P con
tinues to rate our long-term debt rating outlook as Stable since November 2020, whileMoody’s recently upgraded our long-term debt rating outlook to Positive in December 2021.
The current ratings assigned to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:
NAME OF RATING AGENCY
Pfizer Short-Term Rating Pfizer Long-Term Rating Outlook/Watch Moody’s
P-1 A2 Positive S&P
A-1+ A+ Stable A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each
 rating should beevaluated independently of any other rating.
Capital Allocation Framework
Our capital allocation framework is devised to facilitate (i) the achievement of medical breakthroughs through R&D investments and business development activities and (ii) returning
capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See the 
Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook — Our Business and Strategysection of this MD&A.
Our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our business. Our dividends are not restricted by debt
covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizer’s BOD and will continue to be evaluated in the context of
 future business performance, we currently believe that wecan support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events. In December 2021, our BOD declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, payable on
March 4, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 28, 2022
. The first-quarter 2022 cash dividend will be our 333rd consecutive quarterly dividend.See 
Note 12 for information on the shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share-purchase plans, including our accelerated share repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2021, our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $5.3 billion.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual, and Other Obligations
In the ordinary course of business, (i) we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements that may result in contractual and other obligations and (ii) in connection with the sale o
f assetsand businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 46 
may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities. For more information on guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 16B . Additionally, certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions,
co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products. Furthermore, collaboration, licensing or other R&D arrangements may give rise to potential
milestone payments. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization
milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.
Our significant contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021 consisted of:
•
Long-term debt, including current portion (see Note 7 ) and related interest payments; •
Estimated cash payments related to the TCJA repatriation estimated tax liability (see Note 5 ). Estimated future payments related to the TCJA repatriation tax liability that will occur after December 31, 2021 total $8.3 billion, of which an estimated $750 million is to be paid in the next twelve months and
 an estimated $7.6 billion is to be paid in periods thereafter;•
Certain commitments totaling $5.2 billion, of which an estimated $1.5 billion is to be paid in the next twelve months, and $3.7 billion in periods thereafter (see Note 16C ); •
Purchases of property plant and equipment (see Note 9 ). In 2022, we expect to spend approximately $3.3 billion on property, plant and equipment; and •
Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases (see Note 15 ). Gl
obal Economic ConditionsOur Venezuela and Argentina operations function in hyperinflationary economies. The impact to Pfizer is not considered material. For additional information on the global economic
environment, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors––Global Operations  section in this Form 10-K. Market Risk
We are subject to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. The objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange
rate and interest rate movements on our earnings. We address such exposures through a combination of operational means and financial instruments. For more information on how
we manage our foreign exchange and interest rate risks, see 
Notes 1G  and 7E , as well as the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations section in this Form 10-K for key currencies in which we operate. Our sensitivity analyses of such risks are discussed below.
Foreign Exchange Risk
—The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not have any
 effect on another currency’s rates relative tothe U.S. dollar, if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of December 31, 2021, 
the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.Interest Rate Risk
—The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates
as of December 31, 2021, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.
Equity Price Risk
––We hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions. While we are holding such securities, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the 
fair value of equity investments.From time to time, we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk. Our equity securities with readily determinable fair
values are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, the expected
 adverse impact on our net income would not besignificant.
LIBOR
For information on interest rate risk and LIBOR, see the 
Item 1A. Risk Factors––Global Operations  section in this Form 10-K. We do not expect the transition to  an alternative rate tohave a material impact on our liquidity or financial resources.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSRecently Adopted Accounting Standard
See 
Note 1B.Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not Adopted as of December 31, 2021
Standard/Description
Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements
Reference rate reform
 provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate
expected to be discontinued after 2021 because of reference rate reform.
The new guidance provides the following optional expedients:
1.
Simplify accounting analyses under current U.S. GAAP for contract modifications.2.
Simplify the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allow hedging relationships affected byreference rate reform to continue.
3.
Allow a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that referencea rate affected by reference rate reform.
Elections can be adoptedprospectively at any time through
December 31, 2022.
We are assessing the impact, butcurrently, we do not expect this new
guidance to have a material impact
on our consolidated financial
statements.
Accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers 
requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and
measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606. This new guidance will
generally result in the acquirer recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts
that were recorded by the acquiree. Previously, these amounts were recognized by the acquirer at fair
value as of the acquisition date.
January 1, 2023. Early adoption ispermitted.
We do not expect this new guidanceto have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATAReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors 
and ShareholdersPfizer Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and 
Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the relatedconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in 
the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes(collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and
 its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity withU.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1C to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected 
to change its method of accounting for pension and postretirement plans in 2021 toimmediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in the consolidated statements of income.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and
 are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance withthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAO
B. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance aboutwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those
 risks. Such procedures includedexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accoun
ting principlesused and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We
 believe that our audits provide areasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to 
the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which
they relate.
Evaluation of the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual
As discussed in Note 1H to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates
(collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the same period tha
t the corresponding revenues are recognized.The length of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by
 the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significantmanagement judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.
We identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because 
the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assumption involved especiallychallenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Company’s revenue transactions will ultimately be subject to a
related rebate.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness o
f certain internalcontrols over the Company’s U.S. rebates accrual process related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We estimated the
 U.S. rebates accrualusing internal information and historical data and compared the result to the Company’s estimated U.S. rebates accrual. We evaluated the Company’s ability to accurately estimate
the accrual for U.S. rebates by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.
Evaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits
As discussed in Notes 5D and 1
Q , the Company’s tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such auditsmay span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of the
 Company’s tax positions will besustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits
, excluding associated interest, of $6.1 billion.Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 49 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmWe identified the evaluation of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because a high degree of
 audit effort, including specialized skills andknowledge, and complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness o
f an internal controlover the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax position process related to (1) interpretation of tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the Company’s tax positions may not be
sustained upon audit, and (3) estimation and recording of the gross unrecognized tax benefits. We involved tax and
 valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledgewho assisted in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax laws, including the assessment of transfer pricing practices in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations.
We inspected settlements with applicable taxing authorities, including assessing the expiration of statutes of limitations. We tested
 the calculation of the liability for uncertain taxpositions, including an evaluation of the Company’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of
 the amount of tax benefits expected to be sustained.Evaluation of product and other product-related litigation
As discussed in Notes 1S and 16 to the consolidated financial statements,
 the Company is involved in product liability and other product-related litigation, which can includepersonal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others. Certain of these pending product and other product-related legal
proceedings could result in losses that could be substantial. The accrued liability and/or disclosure for the pending product and other product-related legal proceedings requires a
complex series of judgments by the Company about future events, which involves a number of uncertainties.
We identified the evaluation of product and other product-related litigation as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s
judgments about future events and uncertainties.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness o
f certain internalcontrols over the Company’s product liability and other product-related litigation processes, including controls related to (1) the evaluation of information from external and internal
legal counsel, (2) forward-looking expectations, and (3) new legal proceedings, or other legal proceedings not currently reserved or disclosed. We read letters received directly from
the Company’s external and internal legal counsel that described the Company’s probable or reasonably possible legal contingency to pending product and other product-related
legal proceedings. We inspected the Company’s minutes from meetings of the Audit Committee, which included the status of key litigation matters.
 We evaluated the Company’sability to estimate its monetary exposure to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts
incurred upon resolution of prior legal matters. We analyzed relevant publicly available information about the Company, its competitors, and the industry.
 
We have not been able to determine the specific year that we or our predecessor firms began serving as the Company’s auditor, however, we are aware that we or our predecessor
firms have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1942.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significan
t Accounting PoliciesA. Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our parent company and all subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
. The decision of whether ornot to consolidate an entity for financial reporting purposes requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economic or other control over the entity.
 Typically,we do not seek control by means other than voting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the U.S.
, the financial information is included as of and for the year ended November30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended
 December 31 for each year presented. Substantially all unremitted earnings ofinternational subsidiaries are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions among our subsidiaries have been eliminated.
At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure
consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1, our global contract development
and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. See 
Note 17 . On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products. Prior to its sale, Meridian was managed within the Hospital therapeutic area. Beginning in the fourth
 quarter of2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. On December 21, 2020, Pfizer and Viatris completed the 
termination of a pre-existing strategic collaboration between Pfizer and Mylan for generic drugs in Japan (the Mylan-Japan collaboration) pursuant to an agreement dated November 13, 2020, and we
transferred related inventories and operations that were part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris. On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and
 the combination of ourUpjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of 
the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected asdiscontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities associated with Meridian and the Mylan-Japan collaboration are classified as assets and liabilities of
discontinued operations as of December 31, 2020. Upon completion of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business on
 November 16, 2020, the Upjohn assets and liabilities werederecognized from our consolidated balance sheet and are reflected in 
Retained Earnings – Distribution of Upjohn Business in the consolidated statement of equity. Prior to the spin-off of the Upjohn Business in November 2020, the Upjohn Business, the Mylan-Japan collaboration and Meridian were managed as part of our former Upjohn operating segment. With
the separation of the Upjohn Business, the Mylan-Japan collaboration and Meridian, as well as the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, Pfizer transformed into a
 morefocused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. In
addition, other acquisitions and business development activities completed in 2021, 2020 and 2019 impacted financial results in the periods presented. See 
Note 2. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to
 rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.B
. New Accounting Standard Adopted in 2021On January 1, 2021, we adopted a new accounting standard for income tax 
that eliminates certain exceptions to the guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, themethodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of
the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accoun
ting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Theadoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
C. Change in Accounting Principle
In the first quarter of 2021, we adopted a change in accoun
ting principle to a more preferable policy under U.S. GAAP to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses arising fromthe remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans (MTM Accounting).
 Under the prior policy, we deferred recognition of these gains and losses in Accumulated other comprehensive loss
. The accumulated actuarial gains/losses outside of a “corridor” were then amortized into net periodic benefit costs over the average remaining service period or the average life expectancy of participants. This change has been applied to all pension and postretirement plans on a retrospective basis 
for all prior periods presented, and as ofJanuary 1, 2019, resulted in a cumulative effect decrease to 
Retained earnings  of $6.0 billion, with a corresponding offset to Accumulated other comprehensive loss . Each time a pension or postretirement plan is remeasured, the actuarial gain or loss is recognized immediately and classified as 
Other (income)/deductions––net . We believe that MTM Accounting is a more preferable policy as it provides improved transparency of results and performance, better alignment with fair value accounting principles
and a better reflection of current economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions and 
the actuarial impact of plan remeasurements.Pfizer Inc.

D. Estimates and Assumptions
In preparing these financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affec
t reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions can impact allelements of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated statements of income, estimates are used
 when accounting for deductions from revenues, determining the costof inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and estimating restructuring charges and the
 impact of contingencies, as well as determiningprovisions for taxes on income. On the consolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets,
 and in determining the reportedamounts of liabilities, all of which also impact the consolidated statements of income. Certain estimates of fair value and amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, revenue
deductions, impairment reviews, restructuring-associated charges, investments and financial instruments, valuation allowances, pension and postretirement benefit plans,
contingencies, share-based compensation, and other calculations can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions.
Our estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but
 that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If our estimates andassumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted. As future events and 
their effects cannot be determined with precision, our estimatesand assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to
 change those estimates and assumptions.We are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated amounts
, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation,legislation and regulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and expectations about the future. We adjust our estimates and
assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for change.
E. Acquisitions
Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses after the completion of the acquisitions. We accoun
t for acquired businesses using the acquisitionmethod of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of
 the acquisition date andthat the fair value of acquired IPR&D be recorded on the balance sheet.
 Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the assignedvalues of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that do no
t constitute a business, as defined in U.S. GAAP, no goodwill is recognized andacquired IPR&D is expensed in 
Research and development expenses . Contingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date
. Fair value is generallyestimated by using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. See 
Note 16D . Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . F. Fair Value
We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. We estimate fair value using an exit price approach,
which requires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
 liability in an orderly market. The determination of an exitprice is considered from the perspective of market participants, considering the highest and best use of non-financial assets and, for liabilities, assuming that the
 risk of non-performance will be the same before and after the transfer.
When estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of 
the following techniques:•
Income approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.•
Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.•
Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.Our fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:
•
Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).•
Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quotedprices that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means (Level 2 inputs).
•
Unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).The following inputs and valuation techniques are used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:
•
Available-for-sale debt securities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjusted yieldcurves.
•
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values—quoted market prices and observable NAV prices.•
Derivative assets and liabilities—third-party matrix-pricing model that uses inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Where applicable, these models usemarket-based observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves to discount future cash flow amounts, and forward and spot prices for currencies. The credit risk impact to our
derivative financial instruments was not significant.
•
Money market funds—observable NAV prices.We periodically review the methodologies, inputs and outputs of third-party pricing services for reasonableness. Our procedures can include, for example, referencing other third-party
pricing models, monitoring key observable inputs (like benchmark interest rates) and selectively performing test-comparisons of values with actual sales of financial instruments.

G. Foreign Currency Translation
For most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their U.S.
dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet da
te and income and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects thatarise from changing translation rates are recorded in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) . The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net . For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, with translation adjustments recorded in 
Other (income)/deductions––net , and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates. H. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable

––We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to  the customer. We typically determine transfer of controlbased on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer.
Our Sales Contracts
––Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S. Sales
 are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns occur due to LOE, product recalls or a changing competitiveenvironment.
Deductions from Revenues
––Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the  revenues arerecognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and,
as such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Provisions for pharmaceutical sales returns––
Provisions are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; es
timated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment andreturn or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of
 future returns, such as LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment. Generally, returnedproducts are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.
We record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered,
 whichever is later. We estimate the cost of oursales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.
The following outlines our common sales arrangements:
•
Customers––Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines products directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies, and integrated
delivery networks. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. Prescription pharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by
patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance programs, including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales
allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are generally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated
amounts by type of product (e.g., patented or unpa
tented).Specifically:
•
In the U.S., we sell our products principally to distributors and hospitals. We also have contracts with managed care programs or PBMs and legislatively mandated contracts withthe federal and state governments under which we provide rebates based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and
performance-based contract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior periods. We apply the experience
ratio to the respective period’s sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as
current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare “coverage gap,” also known as the “doughnut
hole,” based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in 
the coverage gap. Weevaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends and future expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates
, we also considercurrent contract terms, such as changes in formulary status and rebate rates.
•
Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales within eachperiod, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government’s total unbudge
ted pharmaceuticalspending or on specific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of
 reimbursement. Weobtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.
•
Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices and legislated discounts to third parties) closelyapproximate actual amounts incurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.
We recorded direct product sales and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products in 2021, for each of seven
 products in 2020 and for each of six products in2019. In the aggregate, these direct products sales and/or alliance product revenues represented 75% of
 our revenues in 2021, 54% of our revenues in 2020 and 49% of ourrevenues in 2019. See 
Note 17B for additional information. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally be at lower selling prices and lower volumes due to added generic competition. We generally provide for higher sales returns during the period in which
individual markets begin to near the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights.

Our accruals for Medicare, Medicaid and related state program and performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts are

$ 5,850  $4,708 Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from 
Revenues . Trade Accounts Receivable
—Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate 
for expectedcredit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and
 customer type (high risk versuslow risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.
In determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory
and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. These credit risk indicators are monitored on a quarterly
basis to determine whether there have been any changes in the economic environment that would indicate the established reserve percentages should be adjusted, and
 areconsidered on a regional basis to reflect more geographic-specific metrics. Additionally, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables are tracked against collections on a quarterly
basis to determine whether the reserve percentages remain appropriate. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific
allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where
appropriate) have been exhausted.
During 2021 and 2020, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
I. Collaborative Arrangements
Payments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature o
f the arrangement (including its contractual terms), thenature of the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-promotion agreements, we record the amounts received for our share of gross profits from our collaboration
partners as alliance revenues, a component of 
Revenues,  when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are recorded as we perform co-promotion activities for the collaboration and the collaboration partners sell the products to their customers. The related expenses for
selling and marketing these products including reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for these costs are included in 
Selling, informational and administrative expenses. In collaborative arrangements where we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when we transfer control of the product to our collaboration
partners. In collaboration arrangements where we are the principal in the transaction, we record amounts paid to collaboration partners for their share of net sales or profits earned,
and all royalty payments to collaboration partners as 
Cost of sales . Royalty payments received from collaboration partners are included in Other (income)/deductions—net. Reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for development costs are typically recorded in 
Research and development expenses . Upfront payments and pre-approval milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners in development stage collaborations are recorded as 
Research and development expenses . Milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners after regulatory approval has been attained for a medicine are recorded in 
Identifiable intangible assets—Developed technology rights . Upfront and pre-approval milestone payments earned from our collaboration partners by us are recognized in 
Other (income)/deductions—net  over the development period for the products, when our performance obligations include providing R&D services to our collaboration partners. Upfront, pre-approval and post-approval milestone payments earned by us may be
recognized in 
Other (income)/deductions—net  immediately when earned or over other periods depending upon the nature of our performance obligations in the applicable collaboration. Where the milestone event is regulatory approval for a medicine, we generally recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price when regulatory approval
in the applicable jurisdiction has been attained. We may recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price earlier than the milestone event in certain circumstances
when recognition of the income would not be probable of a significant reversal.
J. Cost of Sales and Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We
regularly review our inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary.
K. Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses
Selling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising,
shipping and handling, information technology and legal defense. Advertising expenses totaled approximately $2.0 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $2.3 billion in 2019.
Production costs are expensed as incurred and the costs of TV, radio, and
 other electronic media and publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 61 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
L. Research and Development Expenses
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&D efforts, as well as costs
 incurred in connection with certain licensing arrangements.Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments we make to third parties under licensing arrangements as expense. Upfront payments
are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives regulatory approval, we record any
milestone payments in 
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization  and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we typically amortize the payments on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter.
M. Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets include:
•
Property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation—These assets are recorded at cost, including any significant improvements after purchase, less accumulated depreciation. Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on a
 straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of theindividual assets. Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.
•
Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization—These assets are recorded at fair value at acquisition. Intangible assets with finite lives  are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized until a useful life can be determined.
•
Goodwill—Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets . Goodwill is not amortized.Amortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is
included in 
Amortization of intangible assets  as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization of intangible assets that  are for a single function anddepreciation of property, plant and equipment are included in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses  and/or Research and development expenses,  as appropriate.
We review our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and
for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less
than the carrying value of these assets.
Specifically:
•
For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators arepresent, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows for the asse
t, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount. If the carryingamount is greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we reevaluate the remaining useful
lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.
•
For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as brands and IPR&D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, for theexcess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review other than for IPR&D assets
, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset asindefinite-lived is appropriate.
•
For goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of the reporting unit over theimplied fair value.
N. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
We may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our cost-
reduction and productivity initiatives.
•
In connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures forconsulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will
not continue in the combined company); and
•
In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges for site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions andthe expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.
Included in 
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs  are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired business. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of an
 asset, that incremental impact is classified in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses
 and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate. Employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination.
 Transaction costs, such asbanking, legal, accounting and other similar costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred
. Our business and platform functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&D, as well as our corporate enabling functions (such as
digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement).
O. Cash Equivalents and Statement of Cash Flows
Cash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. 
If itemsmeeting this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as 
Short-term investments . Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 62 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Cash flows for financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the classification of the
items being hedged. Cash flows for financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the nature of 
the hedging instrument. Cash flows forfinancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are classified according to their purpose and accounting nature.
P. Investments and Derivative Financial Instruments
The classification of an investment depends on the nature of the investment
, our intent and ability to hold the investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence. Ourinvestments are primarily comprised of the following:
•
Public equity securities with readily determinable fair values, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions—net. •
Available-for-sale debt securities, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized. •
Held-to-maturity debt securities, which are carried at amortized cost.•
Private equity securities without readily determinable fair values and where we have no significant influence are measured at cost minus any impairment and plus or minus changesresulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
•
For equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we use theequity-method of accounting. Under the equity-method, we record our share of the investee’s income and expenses in 
Other (income)/deductions—net . The excess of the cost of the investment over our share of the underlying equity in the net assets of
 the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee,with any remaining excess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which is the fair value of consideration paid and typically does not include
contingent consideration.
Realized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.
We regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity, when a decline in fair value, if any, is determined, an impairment charge is
recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in various balance sheet categories (see 
Note 7A ), with changes in fair value reported in Net income  or, for derivative financial instruments in certain qualifying hedging relationships, in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7E ). Q. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies
Tax Assets and Liabilities
Current tax assets
 primarily include (i) tax effects for intercompany transfers of inventory within our combined group, which are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the inventory is sold to a third party and (ii) income tax receivables that are expected to be recovered either via refunds from taxing authorities or reductions to
 future taxobligations.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between 
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities usingenacted tax rates and laws. We provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an
 assessment of estimated future taxableincome that incorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax asse
ts. Amounts recorded forvaluation allowances requires judgments about future income which can depend heavily on estimates and assumptions. All deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax
jurisdiction are presented as a net amount in the noncurrent section of our consolidated balance sheet.
The TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staf
f Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income
, states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes  for temporary basis differencesexpected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the 
tax is incurred. We elected to recognizedeferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years.
Other non-current tax assets primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result 
from the payment of income taxes in another taxjurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as
the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not,
 is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdictionand, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction.
Other taxes payable
 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 include liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the noncurrent portion of the repatriation tax liability for which we elected payment over eight years through 2026. For additional information, see 
Note 5D  for uncertain tax positions and Note 5A  for the repatriation tax liability and other estimates and assumptions in connection with the TCJA.
Income Tax Contingencies
We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a 
tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely on thetechnical merits of the position, we recognize all or a portion of the benefit. We measure the benefit
 by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized uponsettlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.
Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 63 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
We regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that
sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to “more likely than not”; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an
audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expec
t to pay cashwithin the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any,
 are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income  and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability.
Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but
 our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential taxbenefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our 
financial statements in the period of settlement or when thestatutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the
 period of resolution.R. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have
 both IRC-qualified and supplemental(non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible
dependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each o
f our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarialpresent value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be
determined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expec
ted employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, theobligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected
 costof providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are
measured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in 
Other (income)/deductions—net . S. Legal and Environmental Contingencies
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related
litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal
and environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the
extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If
 some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within therange, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be
 a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range.We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.
T. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are
generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in 
Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses  and/or Research and development expenses
, as appropriate. Note 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equi
ty-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative ArrangementsA. Acquisitions
Trillium
On November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by P
fizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developingtherapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2
.0 billion, net of cashacquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliu
m’s lead program, TTI-622, is an investigationalfusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of 
tumors.We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset
, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cashacquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in 
Research and development expenses , of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired
primarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.
Array
On July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule
medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The
 total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net ofcash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense
and recorded in 
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3 ). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash. Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 64 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Array’s portfolio includes Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&D, as well as a portfolio of out-
licensed medicines, which may generate milestones and royalties over time.
The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2020. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded: (i) $6.3
billion in 
Identifiable intangible assets , consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights  with a useful life of 16 years ,  $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of Licensing agreements and other 
($1.2 billion for technology in development –– indefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technology–– finite-lived licensing agreementswith a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of 
Goodwill , (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019. In 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in 
Identifiable intangible assets  of approximately $900 million with a corresponding change to 
Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not
 have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for the yearended December 31, 2020.
Therachon
On July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for
the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up 
to $470million contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset. We accounted for the
 transaction as an asset acquisition sincethe lead asset represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The to
tal fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was $322 million, whichconsisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in 
Research and development expenses.
B. Divestitures
Meridian
On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in
Discontinued operations––net of tax
. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationshipafter the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among
other activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to
 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period.No amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.
Upjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan
On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to
 form Viatris.The Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was
renamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis,
 allof the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as o
f the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date receivedapproximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined
with Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any
applicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the
Upjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of 
the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylanshareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are
generally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S
. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as anindependent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol “VTRS” on the NASDAQ.
In connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.
V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and €3.60 billion aggregate principalamounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan
agreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to 
fund the $12.0 billion cashdistribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate
principal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior
unsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity da
te. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued operations––net of tax
. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn financing arrangements.
As a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed ne
t assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings  and reflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See
 Note 1C.  Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the UpjohnBusiness, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended
 December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a netincrease to 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss  of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net credits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to 
Retained earnings . As a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in 
Discontinued operations––net of tax
. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investmentbanking fees.

In connection with the Transactions, Pfizer and Viatris entered into various agreements to effec
t the Separation and Combination to provide a framework for our relationship after theCombination, including a separation and distribution agreement, interim operating models, including agency arrangements, MSAs, TSAs, a tax matters agreement, and an employee
matters agreement, among others. The interim agency operating model arrangements primarily include billings, collections and remittance of rebates that we are performing on a
transitional basis on behalf of Viatris. Under the MSAs, Pfizer or Viatris, as the case
 may be, manufactures, labels and packages products for the other party. The terms of the MSAsrange in initial duration from 
four  to seven years post-Separation. The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services to Viatris related to finance, information technology and humanresource infrastructure and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than three years post-Separation. The amounts recorded under the
 above agreements were not materialto our consolidated results of operations in 2021 and 2020. In addition, Pfizer and Mylan had a
 pre-existing arms-length commercial agreement, which is continuing with Viatris and isnot material to Pfizer’s consolidated financial statements.
Net amounts due from Viatris under the above agreements were $53 million as of December 31, 2021 and $401 million as of December 31, 2020. The cash flows associated with the
above agreements are included in 
Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, except for  a $277 million payment to Viatris made in 2021 pursuant to terms ofthe separation agreement, which is reported in

C. Equity-Method Investments
Formation of Consumer Healthcare JV
On July 31, 2019, we completed a transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new JV
 that operates globally under the GSKConsumer Healthcare name. In exchange, we received a 32% equity stake in the new company and GSK owns 
the remaining 68%. Upon closing, we deconsolidated our ConsumerHealthcare business and recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.1 billion ($5.4 billion, net of tax) in the third quarter of 2019 in 
(Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction for the difference in the fair value of our 32% equity stake and 
the carrying value of our Consumer Healthcare business. Our financial results and our Consumer Healthcaresegment’s operating results for
 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations. 
The financial results for 2021 and 2020 do not reflect any contribution from the Consumer Healthcare business. In valuing our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV, we used discounted cash flow techniques. Some of the
 more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in thisapproach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which include the expected impact o
f competitive, legal or regulatory forces on the products; the long-termgrowth rate, which seeks to project the sustainable growth rate over the long term; the discount rate
, which seeks to reflect our best estimate of the various risks inherent in theprojected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the
 projected cash flows.We are accounting for our interest in the Consumer Healthcare JV as an equity-method investment. The carrying value of our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV is $16.3
billion as of December 31, 2021 and $16.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and is reported as a private equity investment in 
Equity-method investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its
 financial statements into U.S. dollars andrecognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The decrease in the value of our
investment from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to dividends totaling $499 million, as well as $384 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation
adjustments (see 
Note 6 ), partially offset by our share of the JV’s earnings. We record our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a  one-quarter lag in 
Other (income)/deductions––net  commencing from August 1, 2019. Our total share of the J V’s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first ninemonths of 2021, which we recorded in our operating results in 2021, was $495 million. Our total share of the JV’s earnings generated in the 
fourth quarter of 2019 and the first ninemonths of 2020, which we recorded in our operating results in 2020, was $417 million. Our total share of two months of the
 JV’s earnings generated in the third quarter of 2019,which we recorded in our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019, was $47 million. As of the July 31, 2019 closing date
, we estimated that the fair value of our investment inthe Consumer Healthcare JV was $15.7 billion and that 32% of the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net
 assets of the Consumer Healthcare JV was $11.2 billion,resulting in an initial basis difference of approximately $4.5 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we preliminarily completed the allocation of the basis difference, which resulted from
the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the ne
t assets of the JV, primarily to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets,indefinite-lived intangible assets, related deferred tax liabilities and equity method goodwill within the investment account. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Consumer
Healthcare JV revised the initial carrying value of the net assets of the JV and our 32%
 share of the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the ConsumerHealthcare JV was reduced to $11.0 billion and our initial basis difference was increased to $4.8 billion. The adjustment was allocated to equity method goodwill within the
investment account. We began recording the amortization of basis differences allocated to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities in 
Other (income)/deductions––net
 commencing August 1, 2019. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences resulting from the  excess of the initial fair value of our investmentover the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the J
V is included in Other (income)/deductions––net and was not material to our results of operations in the periods presented. See 
Note 4. Amortization of basis differences on inventory and related deferred tax liabilities was completely recognized by the second quarter of 2020. Basis differences on definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities are being amortized over the lives of the underlying assets, which range from 8 to 20 years.
As a part of Pfizer in 2019, pre-tax income on a management basis for the Consumer Healthcare business was $654 million through July 31, 2019.

 equity method due to the significant influence that we have over the operations of ViiV through our boardrepresentation and minority veto rights. We suspended application of the equity method to our investment in ViiV in 2016
 when the carrying value of our investment was reduced tozero due to the recognition of cumulative equity method losses and dividends. Since 2016, we have recognized dividends from ViiV as income in

E. Collaborative Arrangements
We enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of research and regulatory approval.
Collaborative arrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or commercialization effort, where both we and
our partner are active participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the activity.
 Our rights and obligations under our collaborative arrangementsvary. For example, we have agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and we have agreements where we partner to co-develop
and/or participate together in commercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product.
Collaboration with Beam
On December 24, 2021, we entered into a multi-year research collaboration with Beam to utilize Beam’s in vivo base editing programs, which use mRNA and lipid nanoparticles, for
three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. Under the terms of the
 agreement, Beam conducts all research activities through developmentcandidate selection for three undisclosed targets, which are not included in Beam’s existing programs, and we may opt in to obtain exclusive licenses to each development candidate.
Beam has a right to opt in, at the end o
f phase 1/2 studies, upon the payment by Beam of an option exercise fee, to a global co-development and co-commercialization agreementwith respect to one program licensed under the collaboration pursuant to which we and Beam would share net profits as well as development and commercialization costs in a
65%/35% ratio (Pfizer/Beam). Upon entering into the agreement, we recorded $300 million in 
Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021 for an upfront payment due to Beam, and if we exercise our opt in to licenses for all three targets,
 Beam would be eligible for up to an additional $1.05 billion in development, regulatory andcommercial milestone payments for a potential total deal consideration of up to $1.35 billion. Beam is also eligible to receive royalties on global net sales for each licensed program.
Collaboration with Arvinas
On July 21, 2021, we entered into a global collaboration with Arvinas to develop and commercialize ARV-471, an investigational oral PROTAC
 (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera) estrogen receptor protein degrader. The estrogen receptor is a well-known disease driver in most breast cancers. In connection with the agreement, we made an upfront cash
payment of $650 million to Arvinas and we made a $350 million equity investment in the common stock of Arvinas. We recognized $706 million for the upfront payment and a
 premiumpaid on our equity investment in 
Research and development expenses in our third quarter of 2021. Arvinas is also eligible to receive up to $400 million in approval milestones and up to $1 billion in commercial milestones. The companies will equally share worldwide develop
ment costs, commercialization expenses and profits. As of December 31, 2021, we held a6.5% equity stake of Arvinas.
Collaboration with Myovant

40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women’s health in the U.S. and Canada.
 We also received an exclusive option to commercialize relugolix in oncologyoutside the U.S. and Canada, excluding certain Asian countries, which we declined to exercise. Under the terms of the
 agreement, the companies will equally share profits andallowable expenses for Orgovyx and Myfembree in the U.S. and Canada, with Myovant bearing our share of allowable expenses up to a maximum of $100 million in 2021 and up to a
maximum of $50 million in 2022. We record our share of gross profits as Alliance revenue. Myovant remains responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continues to
lead clinical development for Myfembree. Myovant is entitled to receive up to $4.35 billion, including an upfront payment of $650 million, which was made in December 2020, $200
million in potential regulatory milestones for FDA approvals for Myfembree in women’s health, of which $100 million was paid to Myovant in July 2021 and recognized as 
Identifiable intangible assets—Developed technology rights
, and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion in total for prostate cancer and for the combined women’s health indications. Inconnection with this transaction, in 2020 we recognized $499 million in 
Identifiable intangible assets––Developed technology  rights and $151 million in Research and development expenses 
representing the relative fair value of the portion of the upfront payment allocated to the approved indication and unapproved indications of the product, respectively.Collaboration with CStone

 As of December 31, 2021, we held a 9.8% equity stake of CStone.Collaborations with BioNTech
On December 30, 2021, we entered into a new research, development and commercialization agreement to develop a potential first mRNA-based vaccine for the prevention of
shingles (herpes zoster virus) based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and our antigen technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to pay BioNTech $225
million, including an upfront cash payment of $75 million and an equity investment of $150 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future regulatory and sales milestone payments of up
to $200 million. In return, BioNTech agreed to pay us $25 million for our proprietary antigen technology. The net upfront payment to
 BioNTech was recorded to Research and development expenses 
in our fourth quarter of 2021. We and BioNTech will share development costs. We will have commercialization rights to the potential vaccine worldwide, excluding Germany, Turkey and certain developing countries where BioNTech will have commercialization rights. We and BioNTech will share gross profits from commercialization of
any product.
On April 9, 2020, we signed a global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program, BNT162b2, aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection. In
connection with the April 2020 agreement, we made an upfront cash payment of $72 million and an equity investment in the
 common stock of BioNTech of $113 million. Werecognized $98 million for the upfront payment and a premium paid on the equity investment in 
Research and development expenses in our second quarter of 2020. BioNTech became eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to $563 million for a total consideration of $748 million. Under the terms of this agreement, we and BioNTech share
gross profits and development costs equally after approval and successful commercialization of the vaccine, and we were responsible for all of
®Pfizer Inc.
2021 Form 10-K 69 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
the development costs until commercialization of the vaccine. Thereafter, BioNTech was to repay us its 50 percent share of
 these development costs through reductions in gross profitsharing and milestone payments to BioNTech over time. On January 29, 2021, we and BioNTech signed an amended version of the
 April 2020 agreement. Under the January 2021agreement, BioNTech paid us their 50 percent share of prior development costs in a lump sum payment during the first quarter of 2021. Further R&D cos
ts are being shared equally.We have commercialization rights to the vaccine worldwide, excluding Germany and Turkey where BioNTech markets and distributes the vaccine under the agreement with us, and
excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, which are subject to a separate collaboration between BioNTech and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. We
recognize 
Revenues  and Cost of sales  on a gross basis in markets where we are commercializing the vaccine and we record our share of gross profits related to sales of the vaccine by BioNTech in Germany and Turkey in Alliance revenues.
We made an additional investment of $50 million in common stock of BioNTech as part of an underwritten equity offering by BioNTech, which closed in July 2020. 
As of December 31,2021, we held an equity stake of 2.5% of BioNTech.

. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity InitiativesIn 2019, we substantially completed several multi-year initiatives focused on positioning us for future growth and creating a simpler, more efficient operating structure within each
business.
A. Transforming to a More Focused Company Program
With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in 
the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer has transformed into a more focused, globalleader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base and support model align appropriately with our new operating
structure. While certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the
 spin-off, there are indirect costs which did nottransfer. This program is primarily composed of the following three initiatives:
•
We are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&D and PGS platform functions. We expect costs, primarily related torestructuring our corporate enabling functions, to total $1.6 billion, with substantially all costs to be cash expenditures. Actions include, among o
thers, changes in location of certainactivities, expanded use and co-location of centers of excellence and shared services, and increased use of digital technologies. The associated ac
tions and the specific costs willprimarily include severance and benefit plan impacts, exit costs as well as associated implementation costs.
•
In addition, we are transforming our commercial go-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. We expect costs of $1.1 billion, with substantially all costs to becash expenditures. Actions include, among others, centralization of certain activities and enhanced use of digital technologies. The cos
ts for this effort primarily include severanceand associated implementation costs.
•
We are also optimizing our manufacturing network under this program and incurring one-time costs for cost-reduction initiatives related to our manufacturing operations. We expectto incur costs of $800 million, with approximately 25% of the costs to be non-cash. The cos
ts for this effort include, among other things, severance costs, implementation costs,product transfer costs, site exit costs, as well as accelerated depreciation.
The program costs discussed above are expected to be incurred primarily from 2020 through 2022, and may be rounded and represent approximations.
From the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through December 31, 2021,
 we incurred costs of $2.2 billion, of which $856 million is associated with Biopharma ($712million in 2021, $79 million in 2020 and $64 million in 2019).

B. Key Activities
In 2021 and 2020, we incurred costs of $1.3 billion and $838 million, respectively, composed primarily of the Transforming to a More Focused Company program. In 2019, we incurred
costs of $820 million composed of $548 million for the 2017-2019 and Organizing for Growth initiatives, $288 million for the integration of Array, $94 million for the integration of

2021 v. 2020
–– The domestic income in 2021 versus domestic loss in 2020 was mainly related to Comirnaty income, lower asset impairment charges, net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in2020 and higher net 
gains from equity securities, partially offset by higher R&D expenses. The increase in the international income was primarily related to Comirnaty income, net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus netperiodic benefit costs
 in 2020 and lower asset impairment charges.2020 v. 2019
–– The domestic loss in 2020 versus domestic income in 2019 was mainly related to the non-recurrence of the gain on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction as well as higher assetimpairment charges and hig
her R&D expenses. The increase in the international income was primarily related to the non-recurrence of the write off of assets contributed to the Consumer Healthcare JV as well as lowerasset impairment charge

We
 elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreignearnings
 over eight years through 2026. The third annual installment of this liability was paid by its April 15, 2021 due date. The fourth annual installment is due April 18, 2022 and isreported
 in current Income  taxes payable as  of December 31, 2021. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other  taxes payable. Our  obligations may vary as a result ofchanges in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.
The changes in 
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income  impacting the effective tax rate year-over-year are summarized below: 2021 v. 2020
The higher effective tax rate in 2021 was mainly the result of:
•
the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings primarily related to Comirnaty; and•
lower tax benefits related to the impairment of intangible assets,partially offset by:
•
certain initiatives executed in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK based on estimates and assumptions that webelieve to be reasonable.
2020 v. 2019
The higher effective tax rate in 2020 was mainly the result of:
•
the non-recurrence of the $1.4 billion tax benefits, representing taxes and interest, recorded in 2019 due to the favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years;•
the non-recurrence of the tax benefits related to certain tax initiatives associated with the implementation of our then new business structure; and•
the non-recurrence of the tax benefits recorded in 2019 as a result of additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury related to the TCJA, as well as:•
lower tax benefits related to the impairment of intangible assets,partially offset by:
•
the non-recurrence of the tax expense of $2.7 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2019 associated with the gain on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction;and
•
the favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business.In all years, federal, state and international net tax liabilities assumed or established as part of a business acquisition are not included in

ncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called “Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions,” as well as changes in valuation allowances. Specifically: (i) thejurisdictional location of earni
ngs is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year, and the rate impact of this component is influenced by the specific location of non-U.S. earnings and the level of suchearnings as compared to o
ur total earnings; (ii) the U.S. tax implications of our foreign operations is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year and generally offsets some of the reduction to our effectivetax rate each year resulting from t
he jurisdictional location of earnings; (iii) the impact of certain tax initiatives; and (iv) the impact of changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called “Taxsettlements and resolution of c
ertain tax positions” is a component of our effective tax rate each year that can result in either an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate. The jurisdictional mix of earnings, whichincludes the impact of the locati
on of earnings as well as the U.S. tax cost on our international operations, can vary as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and as a result of the extent andlocation of other income an
d expense items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and gains and losses on strategic business decisions. See also Note 5A for the components of pre -tax income andProvision/(benefit) 
for taxes on income, which is based on the locatio n of the taxing authorities, and for information about settlements and other items impacting Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. In all years, the reduction in o
ur effective tax rate is a result of the jurisdictional location of earnings and is largely due to lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions, as well as manufacturing and other incentives for oursubsidiaries in Singapore a
nd, to a lesser extent, in Puerto Rico. We benefit from Puerto Rican tax incentives pursuant to a grant that expires during 2029. Under such grant, we are partially exempt from income,property and municipal ta
xes. In Singapore, we benefit from incentive tax rates effective through 2047 on income from manufacturing and other operations.Includes changes in interest r

The deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with global intangible low-taxed income are included in the relevant categories. See Note 1Q . The increase in net deferred t
ax assets in 2021 is primarily related to temporary differences associated with Comirnaty royalty accruals and the result of operating lease ROU liabilities recognized during the period.The increase in the deferred t
ax assets is primarily due to the acquisition of intangible assets relating to Trillium and the decrease in the 2021 deferred tax liabilities is primarily the result of amortization of intangibleassets.

The increase in net deferred t
ax liabilities in 2021 is primarily the result of operating lease ROU assets recognized during the period. See Note 15 . The decrease in net deferre
d tax assets in 2021 is primarily the result of favorable pension plan asset performance reported in the period. See Note 11A . The amounts in 2021 and 
2020 are reduced for unrecognized tax benefits of $3.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, where we have net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, and/or tax credit carryforwardsthat are available, under t
he tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position.The decrease in net deferre
d tax liabilities in 2021 is primarily due to certain initiatives executed in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV.In 2021, 
Noncurrent deferred tax a ssets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.6 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($0.3 billion). In 2020, Noncurrent deferred tax a ssets and other noncurrent tax assets ($0.9 billion), and 
Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($4.1 billion). We have carryforwards, primarily related to net operating and capital losses, general business credits, foreign tax credits and charitable contributions, which are available to reduce
future U.S. federal and/or state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 2022 to
 2041. Certain of our U.S. netoperating losses and general business credits are subject to limitations under IRC Section 382.
As of December 31, 2021, we have not made a U.S. 
tax provision on $55.0 billion of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are intended to beindefinitely reinvested overseas, the determination of a hypothetical unrecognized deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2021 is not practicable. The amount of indefinitely
reinvested earnings is based on estimates and assumptions and subject to management evaluation, and is subject to change in 
the normal course of business based on operationalcash flow, completion of local statutory financial statements and the finalization of tax returns and
 audits, among other things. Accordingly, we regularly update our earnings andprofits analysis for such events.
D. Tax Contingencies
For a description of our accounting policies associated with accounting for income tax contingencies, see 
Note 1Q. Uncertain Tax Positions
As tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax
 positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2021, we had $4.5billion and as of December 31, 2020, we had $4.3 billion in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest.
•
Tax assets for uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes inanother tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation,
commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not,
 is dependent upon the actual payment oftaxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As o
f December 31, 2021, we had $1.5 billion in assets associatedwith uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in 
Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets  ($1.4 billion) and Other taxes payable  ($105 million). As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.3 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts
 were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets
 ($1.1 billion), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($122 million) and Other taxes payable ($46 million). •
Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:

Interest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded primarily in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income . In 2021 and 2020, we recorded net increases in interest of $108 million and $89 million, respectively. In 2019, we recorded a net decrease in interest of $564 million, resulting
primarily from a settlement with the IRS. Gross accrued interest totaled $601 million as of December 31, 2021 (reflecting a decrease of $1 million as a result of cash payments) and

accrued interest totaled $493 million as of December 31, 2020 (reflecting a decrease of $5 million as a result of cash payments and a decrease of $75
 million relating to theseparation of Upjohn). In 2021 and 2020, these amounts were substantially all included in 
Other taxes payable. Accrued penalties are not significant. See also Note 5A. Status of Tax Audits and Potential Impact
 on Accruals for Uncertain Tax PositionsThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. With respect to
 Pfizer, the IRS has issued Revenue Agent’s Reports (RARs) for tax years 2011-2013 and 2014-2015. We are not in agreement with the RARs and are currently appealing certain disputed issues. Tax years 2016-2018 are currently under audit. Tax years 2019-
2021 are open, but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. 
In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years in certain major international taxjurisdictions such as Canada (2013-2021), Europe (2011-2021, primarily reflecting Ireland, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Asia Pacific (2011-2021, primarily reflecting
China, Japan and Singapore) and Latin America (1998-2021, primarily reflecting Brazil).
Any settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate 
that it is reasonably possible that within the next12 months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by as much as $75
 million, as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration ofthe statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions 
that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized taxbenefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of ac
tual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period ofsettlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these even
ts as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities caninclude formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax
 positions, and suchchanges could be significant.

In January 2019, we repurchased all €1.1 billion ($1.3 billion) principal amount outstanding of the 5.75% euro-denominated debt due June 2021 at a redemption value of €1.3 billion
($1.5 billion). We recorded a net loss of $138 million in 
Other (income)/deductions––net , which included the related termination of cross currency swaps . E. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
Foreign Exchange Risk
A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in 
foreign exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset byother exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to
mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of 
translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominatedtransactions.
The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
•
We hedge a portion of our forecasted intercompany inventory sales denominated in euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, U.K. pound and Australian dollar for upto two years.
•
Under certain market conditions, we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities.Changes in fair value are reported in earnings or in 
Other comprehensive income/(loss) , depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument (hedge or offset relationship). For certain foreign exchange contracts, we exclude an amount from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and
 recognize the excluded amount through an amortizationapproach in earnings. The hedge relationships are as follows:
•
Generally, we recognize the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value ofthe hedged item. We also recognize the offsetting foreign exchange impact attributable to
 the hedged item in earnings.•
Generally, we record in Other comprehensive income/(loss)  gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges and reclassify those  amountsinto earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
•
We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss)  ––Foreign currency translation adjustments, net the foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign exchange-denominated debt and foreign exchange contracts designated as a hedge of our net
 investments in foreign subsidiaries and reclassify those amounts into earnings upon the sale or substantialliquidation of our net investments.
•
For foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognize the gains and losses immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the itemsthey generally offset. These contracts take the opposite currency position of
 that reflected on the balance sheet to counterbalance the effect of any currency movement.Interest Rate Risk
Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments
by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes
 in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, orto convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.
We recognize the change in fair value on interest rate contracts that are designated as 
fair value hedges in earnings, as well as the offsetting earnings impact of the hedged riskattributable to the hedged item.
The following summarizes the fair value of the derivative financial instruments and notional amounts (including those reported as part of discontinued operations):

allowance for credit losses, see 
Note 1H . A significant portion of our trade accounts receivable balances are due from wholesalers and governments. For additional information on our trade accounts receivables with significant customers, see 
Note 17C . With respect to our investments, we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with government, government agency, and corporate issuers of securities. 
Investments are placedin instruments that are investment grade and are primarily short in duration. Exposure limits are established to limit a concentration with any single credit counterparty. As of
December 31, 2021, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio represent primarily sovereign debt instruments issued by the U.S., Canada, Japan, U.K.
, Germany, France,Australia, and Switzerland.
With respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty.
 Derivative financialinstruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions
requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As
of December 31, 2021, the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a ne
t payable position was $372 million, for which we have posted collateral of$382 million with a corresponding amount reported in
 Short-term investments . As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that  are in anet receivable position was $477 million, for which we have received collateral of $581 million with a corresponding amount reported in
 Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.

amount primarily reflects $500 million of capitalized Comirnaty sales milestones to BioNTech, partially offset by net losses from foreign currency translation adjustments.The decrease is primarily due to am
ortization, partially offset by the capitalization of the Comirnaty milestones described above.Developed Technology Rights
Developed technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market,
 sell and/or offer for sale theproduct, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes that
 have been completed. We possess a well-diversifiedportfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology
rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi,
 Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Tygacil, Bavencio,Merrem/Meronem and Comirnaty. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription
pharmaceutical products.
Brands
Brands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive paten
t protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, whilefinite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.
IPR&D
IPR&D assets represent R&D assets that have not yet
 received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&D are the following: the program for the oralpoly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation
acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the
abandonment of the associated R&D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the
 date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in amajor market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to
 certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine theuseful life of the asset, reclassify it out of I
PR&D and begin amortization. If the associated R&D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&D assets will likely be written-off, and we willrecord an impairment charge.
IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&D. Accordingly, we expect tha
t many of these IPR&D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some timein the future.
Licensing Agreements
Licensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array
acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to fu
ture royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensingpartner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development
that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each
 of these assets is classified asindefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the
respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-
off, and we will record an impairment charge.

Amortization
The weighted-average life for each of our total finite-lived intangible assets is approximately 8 years, and for the largest component, developed technology rights, is approximately 7
years. Total amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $3.7 billion in 2021, $3.4 billion in 2020 and $4.5 billion in 2019.

$ 49,208  As a result of the 
reorganization of our commercial operations during the fourth quarter of 2021 (see Note 17 ), we were required to estimate th e relative fair values of our PC1 and Hospital organizations to determine anyreallocation of goodwill. We compl
eted this analysis and determined that no goodwill was required to be reallocated. As a result, our entire goodwill balance continues to be assigned within the Biopharma reportablesegment.
Additions primarily represent the im
pact of measurement period adjustments related to our Array acquisition (see Note 2A ). Other represents the i
mpact of foreign exchange.Note 11
.  Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution PlansThe majority of our employees worldwide are eligible for retirement benefits provided through defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we sponsor
both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of the IRC, and,
generally, contributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of employees with restrictions on discriminating in favor of
highly compensated employees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to certain employees. In addition,
we provide medical insurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans.
As discussed in 
Note 1C , we adopted a change in accounting principle to a more preferable policy under U.S. GAAP to  immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses arising fromthe remeasurement of pension and postretirement plans. This change has been applied to all pension and postretirement plans on a retrospective basis for all prior periods presented.

f long-term trends as well as market conditions thatmay have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
The weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined annually and evaluated and modified to reflect at year-end the
 prevailing market rate of a portfolioof high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better that reflect
 the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our international plans, the discountrates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA/Aa or better,
 including, when there is sufficient data, a yield curve approach. These ratedeterminations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at year-end 2021 resulted in higher discount rates as
compared to the prior year.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our pension and postretirement plans’ assets:
•
Cash and cash equivalents: Level 1 investments may include cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments may include short-terminvestment funds which are commingled funds priced at a stable NAV by the administrator of the funds.
•
Equity securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level1 and Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on quoted prices on an exchange or a published NAV derived from the
quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Level 3 investments may include individual securities that are unlisted, delisted, suspended, or illiquid and are typically
valued using their last available price.
•
Fixed income securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they aretraded. Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on observable prices of the underlying securities. Level 2 investments
may include corporate bonds, government and government agency obligations and other fixed income securities valued using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of
securities with similar characteristics. Level 3 investments may include securities that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment managers or brokers, which
use proprietary pricing models that incorporate unobservable inputs.
•
Other investments: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded.Level
 2 investments may include Insurance contracts which invest in interest bearing cash, U.S. government securities and corporate debt instruments. Level 3 investments mayinclude
 securities  or insurance  contracts  that are valued using alternative  pricing sources,  such as investment  managers  or brokers, which use proprietary  pricing models thatincorporate unobservable inputs.
Equity securities, Fixed income securities and Other investments may each be combined into commingled funds. Most commingled funds are valued to reflect the interest in the
 fundbased on the reported year-end NAV. Partnership and Other investments are valued based on year-end reported NAV (or its equivalent), with adjustments
 as appropriate for laggedreporting of up to three months.
Certain investments are authorized to include derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards for managing risks and exposures.
Global plan assets are managed with the objective of generating returns that will enable the plans to meet their future obligations, while seeking to manage ne
t periodic benefit costsand cash contributions over the long-term. We utilize long-term asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans’ invested assets. Our long-term return expectations are
developed based on a diversified, global investment strategy that takes into account historical experience, as well as the impact of
 portfolio diversification, active portfoliomanagement, and our view of current and future economic and financial market conditions. As market conditions and other factors change,
 we may adjust our targets accordingly andour asset allocations may vary from the target allocations.
E. Cash Flows
It is our practice to fund amounts for our qualified pension plans that are at least
 sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws and localtax laws.

F. Defined Contribution Plans
We have defined contribution plans in the U.S. and other countries. For the majority of 
the U.S. defined contribution plans, employees may contribute a portion of their salaries andbonuses to the plans, and we match, in cash, a portion of
 the employee contributions. We also offer a Retirement Savings Contribution (RSC) which is an annual non-contributoryemployer contribution in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We recorded charges related to the employer contributions to global defined contribution plans of $732 million in 2021, $685 million
in 2020 and $659 million in 2019.

A. Common Stock Purchases
We purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in the open market as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under each of the
 share-purchase plans, which are authorized by our BOD, are available for general corporate purposes. In December 2017, the BOD authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program,
which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2019. In December 2018, the B
OD authorized another $10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time and share repurchasescommenced thereunder in the first quarter of 2019.
In February 2019, we entered into an ASR with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC 
to repurchase $6.8 billion of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced share repurchaseauthorization. We paid $6.8 billion and received an initial delivery of 130 million shares of common stock, which represented approximately 80% of the notional amount of the ASR. In
August 2019, the ASR with Goldman Sachs & Co.
 LLC was completed resulting in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC owing us an additional 33.5 million shares of our common stock. Theaverage price paid for all of the shares delivered under the ASR was $41.42 per share. The common stock received is included in 
Treasury stock . The following provides the number of shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share purchase plans, including our ASR:

B. Preferred Stock and Employee Stock Ownership Plans
Prior to May 4, 2020, we had outstanding Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock (the Series A 
Preferred Stock) that was held by an ESOP trust (the Trust). All outstandingshares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted, at the direction of 
the independent fiduciary under the Trust and in accordance with the certificate of designations for the Series APreferred Stock, into shares of our common stock on May 4, 2020. The
 Trust received an aggregate of 1,070,369 shares of our common stock upon conversion, with zero shares ofSeries A Preferred Stock remaining outstanding as a result of the conversion. In December 2020, we filed a certificate
 of elimination and a restated certificate of incorporation with theDelaware Secretary of State, which eliminated the Series A Preferred Stock.
Since May 4, 2020, we have one ESOP tha
t holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP). As of December 31, 2021, all shares of common stock held by the CommonESOP have been allocated to the Pfizer U.S
. defined contribution plan participants. The compensation cost related to the Common ESOP was $19 million in 2021, $19 million in 2020and $20 million in 2019.
Note 13. Share-Based Payments
Our compensation programs can include share-based payment awards with value that is determined by reference to the fair value of our shares and that provide for the grant
 ofshares or options to acquire shares or similar arrangements. Our share-based awards are designed based on competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for compensation
purposes, and are allocated between different long-term incentive awards, generally in the form of Total Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), Portfolio
Performance Shares (PPSs), Performance Share Awards (PSAs), Breakthrough Performance Awards (BPAs) and S
tock Options, as determined by the Compensation Committee.The 2019 Stock Plan (2019 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2014 Plan. It
 provides for 400 million shares, in addition to shares remaining under the 2014 Plan, to be authorized forgrants. The 2019 Plan provides that the number of stock options,
 TSRUs, RSUs, or performance-based awards that may be granted to any one individual during any 36-month periodis limited to 20 million shares, and that RSUs count as three shares, PPSs, P
SAs and BPAs count as three shares times the maximum potential payout, while TSRUs and stockoptions count as one share, toward the maximum shares available under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2021,
 315 million shares were available for award. Although not requiredto do so, we have used authorized and unissued shares and, to a lesser exten
t, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.(a)(a)

 calculation until the conversion date, which occurred in May 2020. See Note 12 . Note 15. Leases
We lease real estate, fleet, and equipment for use in our operations. Our leases generally have lease terms of 1
 to 30 years, some of which include options to terminate or extendleases for up to 5 to 10 years or on a month-to-month basis. We include options tha
t are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the determination of lease terms. We maynegotiate termination clauses in anticipation of any changes in market conditions, but generally these termination options have not been exercised. Residual value guarantees are
generally not included within our operating leases with the exception of some fleet leases. In addition to base rent payments,
 the leases may require us to pay directly for taxes andother non-lease components, such as insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses, which may be dependent on usage or vary month-to-month. 
Variable lease paymentsamounted to $381 million in 2021, $380 million in 2020 and $326 million in 2019. We elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components in
calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all underlying asset classes.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract and we perform the lease classification test
 as of the lease commencement date. ROU assets represent ourright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and
liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of
 our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use ourestimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.
For operating leases, the ROU assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets follows:

ies and Certain CommitmentsWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies. The following outlines our
legal contingencies. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see 
Note 5B. A. Legal Proceedings
Our legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result inloss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues 
from that product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of theseactions.
•
Product liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust andbreach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence
and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.
•
Commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricingclaims and environmental claims and proceedings, can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.
•
Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and inother jurisdictions.
Certain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or
criminal charges.
We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do
 notbelieve that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expecta
tionsregarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash 
flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued orpaid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and,
 therefore, determiningthe likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate 
the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amountsaccrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, are based on
 estimates and assumptions that have been deemedreasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and
 circumstances may occur that might cause us to change thoseestimates and assumptions.

Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates
and assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million in potential or actual
governmental monetary sanctions.
The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and
qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of
 damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and ofthe strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to
 be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; thejurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies
have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader’s
judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; 
the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of publicinterest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent
 matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by thepatent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of
 amounts accrued is remote.A1. Legal Proceedings––Patent Litigation
We are involved in suits relating to our patents, including but not limited to, those discussed below. Most involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that paten
ts covering ourproducts (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms
are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been
 filed alleging that our assertionsof, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect
 to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patentsthat are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those o
f our collaboration/licensing partners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. For example, someof our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We are also party to patent
 damages suits in various jurisdictionspursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.
We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and
 TrademarkOffice, the European Patent Of
fice, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents is found to beinvalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the
patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. In 2017, the Patent Trial and Appeal 
Board (PTAB)initiated proceedings with respect to two of our pneumococcal vaccine patents. However, the PTAB declined to
 initiate proceedings as to two other pneumococcal vaccine patents;those two patents, and one other patent,
 were challenged in federal court in Delaware. In September 2021, Pfizer and a challenger entered into a settlement and license agreement,resolving all worldwide legal proceedings involving that challenger, related to our pneumococcal vaccine patents. Other challenges to pneumococcal vaccine patents remain pending
at the PTAB and outside the U.S
. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines into the marketplace. In theevent that any of the patents are 
found valid and infringed, a competitor’s vaccine might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its pa
tents by ourcommercial or other activities. For example, our Hospira subsidiaries are involved in patent and patent-related disputes over their attempts to bring generic pharmaceutical and
biosimilar products to market. If one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a
 third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royaltypayments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such
 damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfullyinfringed valid patent rights of a third party.
Actions In Which We Are The Plaintiff
EpiPen
In 2010, King, which we acquired in 2011 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary, brought a patent-infringement action against Sandoz in the U.S. District Court for 
the District of NewJersey in connection with Sandoz’s abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filed with the FDA seeking approval to market an epinephrine injectable product. Sandoz is challenging

Inlyta (axitinib)
In 2019, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Glenmark) notified us that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA
 seeking approval to market a generic version of Inlyta. Glenmark asserts theinvalidity and non-infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta that expires in 2030. In 2019, we 
filed suit against Glenmark in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware,asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta.
Ibrance (palbociclib)
Beginning in September 2020, we received correspondence from several generic companies notifying us that they would seek approval to market generic versions of Ibrance
capsules. The generic companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of our crystalline form patent which expires in 2034. Beginning in October 2020, we brought patent
infringement actions against each of these generic companies in various federal courts, asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent. We have
 settled with oneof these generic companies on terms not material to the company.
Beginning in January 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Ibrance 
tablets. The genericcompanies are challenging some or all of the following patents: (i) the composition of matter patent expiring in 2027; (ii) the composition of matter patent expiring in 2023; (iii) the
method of use patent expiring in 2023; (iv) the crystalline form patent expiring in 2034; and (v) a tablet formulation patent expiring in 2036. We
 brought patent infringement actionsagainst each of the generic filers in various federal courts, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents challenged by 
the generic companies.Eucrisa
Beginning in September 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of 
Eucrisa. The companiesassert the invalidity and non-infringement of a composition of matter patent expiring in 2026, two method of use pa
tents expiring in 2027, and one other method of use patent expiringin 2030. In September 2021, we brought patent infringement actions against the
 generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity andinfringement of the patents challenged by the generic companies.
Matter Involving Our Collaboration/Licensing Partners
Eliquis
In 2017, twenty-five generic companies sent BMS Paragraph-IV certification letters informing BMS that they
 had filed ANDAs seeking approval of generic versions of Eliquis,challenging the validity and infringement of one or more of the three patents listed in the Orange Book
 for Eliquis. One of the patents expired in December 2019 and the remainingpatents currently are set to expire in 2026 and 2031. Eliquis has been jointly developed and is being commercialized by BMS and Pfizer. BMS and
 Pfizer filed patent-infringementactions against all generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the U.S. District Court for the District of Wes
t Virginia, asserting that each of the genericcompanies’ proposed products would infringe each of the patent(s) that each generic filer challenged. Some generic filers challenged only the 2031 patent, some challenged both the
2031 and 2026 patent, and one generic company challenged all three patents. In 
August 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled that both the 2026 patent andthe 2031 patent are valid and infringed by the proposed generic products. In August
 and September 2020, the generic filers appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit. Prior to the August 2020 ruling, we and BMS settled with certain o
f the companies on terms not material to us, and we and BMS may settle with othergeneric companies in the future. In September 2021, the U.S. Court o
f Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision.A2. Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation
We
 are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damagesand other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.
Asbestos
Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety
clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other
claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore
various means of resolving, these claims.
Numerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged
personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.
There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by
Pfizer or its subsidiaries.
Effexor
Beginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions,
 affiliates of Wyeth and certain otherdefendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor.
 The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting of all persons inthe U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor 
XR from any of the defendants fromJune 14, 2008 until the time the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of
 the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and itsterritories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain of the actions, the antitrust,
 consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyethfraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents 
for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlementagreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each of the
 plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative classin the
Pfizer Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its 
territories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have beenconsolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.
In 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs’ claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct purchaser plaintiff
claims. In 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which
plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
 Third Circuit. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded theclaims to the District Court.
Lipitor
Beginning in 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in most
 of the actions,Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of
persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the
defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the
 launch of generic Lipitor, in violationof federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to
 which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certainpatent litigation involving Lipitor and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the
actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents for Lipitor. Each o
f the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf of the putative class for allegedprice overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of
their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that
 are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actionsdescribed above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District
 Court for the District of New Jersey.In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, 
the District Court dismissed withprejudice the claims of all other Multi-District Litigation plaintiffs. All plaintiffs have appealed the District Court’s orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and 
for leave to amend their complaint tothe Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of
 Appeals reversed the District Court’s decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.Also, in 2013, the State of West
 Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief on behalf of theState of West Virginia and residents of that sta
te that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above.EpiPen (Direct Purchaser)
In February 2020, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against
 Pfizer, its affiliates King and Meridian, and various Mylan entities, on behalf of apurported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the defendants. Plaintiffs in 
this action generally allege that Pfizer and Mylanconspired to delay market entry of generic EpiPen through the settlement of paten
t litigation regarding EpiPen, and thereby delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation offederal antitrust law. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In July 2021, 
the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the directpurchaser complaint, without prejudice. In September 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.
Nexium 24HR and Protonix
A number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturers in various federal and state
courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed kidney-related injuries purportedly as a result of the ingestion of certain proton pump inhibitors. The cases against Pfizer involve Protonix
and/or Nexium 24HR and seek compensatory and punitive damages and, in some cases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement. In 2017, the 
federal actions were orderedtransferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. As part of our Consumer Healthcare JV transaction
with GSK, the JV has agreed to assume, and
 to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of such litigation to the extent related to Nexium 24HR.Docetaxel
•
Personal Injury ActionsA number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed permanent hair
loss. The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the
 branded product, Taxotere. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitivedamages.
In 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
•
Mississippi Attorney General Government ActionIn 2018, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a complaint in Mississippi state court against the manufacturer of the
 branded product and eight other manufacturers including Pfizerand Hospira, alleging, with respect to Pfizer and Hospira, a failure to warn about a risk of permanent hair loss in violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act. The action seeks
civil penalties and injunctive relief.
Zantac
A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types o
f cancer, or face an increased risk of developingcancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these
 cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac.Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the
 product. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.In February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
Plaintiffs in the Multi-District Litigation have filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, a consolidated consumer class action complaint
alleging, among other things, claims under consumer protection

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
statutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states.
 Plaintiffs previously had filed a consolidatedthird-party payor class action complaint alleging violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statute and seeking reimbursement for payments
made for the prescription version of Zantac, but the Multi-District Litigation court dismissed that complaint; Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal to the U.
S. Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit. In addition, (i) Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive
damages for personal injury and economic loss, allegedly arising from the defendants’ sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of
Baltimore separately filed civil actions against Pfizer and many other defendants in state court, alleging various state statutory and
 common law claims in connection with thedefendants’ alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to
coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other defendants filed in California state court.
Chantix
Beginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against 
Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizer’s voluntary recall of Chantix due to thepresence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold
by Pfizer. Plaintiffs seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including damages and medical monitoring. Similar putative class actions have
been filed in Canada and Israel, where the product brand is Champix.
A3. Legal Proceedings––Commercial and Other Matters
Monsanto-Related Matters
In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and spun
off the shares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then 
transferred its agricultural operations to a newlycreated subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to
 indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia’s former agriculturalbusiness. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has
been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.
In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses. As the result of its
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia’s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites
that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off 
that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, anyliabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia’s and New Monsanto’s assumption
of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to
 Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses in which Pharmaciais named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto
are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia
when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.
Environmental Matters
In 2009, we submitted a revised site-wide feasibility study with regard to the Wyeth Holdings Corporation (formerly, American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial chemical
facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. In 2011, Wyeth Holdings Corporation executed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and 
Order on Consent for Removal Action (the 2011Administrative Settlement Agreement) with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with regard to 
the Bound Brook facility. In accordance with the 2011 AdministrativeSettlement Agreement, we completed construction of an interim remedy. In 2012, the 
EPA issued a final remediation plan for the Bound Brook facility’s main plant area. In 2013,Wyeth Holdings Corporation (now Wyeth Holdings LLC) entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to allow us to
 undertake detailedengineering design of the remedy for the main plant area and to perform a focused feasibility study for two adjacent lagoons.
 In 2015, the U.S., on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaintand consent decree with the federal District Court for the District of New Jersey that allows Wyeth Holdings LLC to complete the design and 
to implement the remedy for the mainplant area. The consent decree (which supersedes the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement) was entered by the District Court in 2015. 
In 2018, the EPA issued a finalremediation plan for the two adjacent lagoons. In 2019, Wyeth Holdings LLC entered into an Administrative Settlement 
Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to allow us toundertake detailed engineering design of the remedy for the lagoons. In September 2021, the U.
S., on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint and consent decree with the federal DistrictCourt for the District of New Jersey, which the court approved in November 2021, that will allow Wyeth Holdings LLC to complete the design and implement the remedy for the two
adjacent lagoons.
We have accrued for the estimated costs of the site remedies for the
 Bound Brook facility.We are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as
 amended, and other state,local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.
Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health
In 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a number of pharmaceutical
and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that 
thedefendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and
seeks monetary relief. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs’ claims. In January 2022, the
 Court of Appeals reversed theDistrict Court’s decision. In February 2022, the defendants filed for en banc review of the Court of 
Appeals’ decision.Pfizer Inc.

Allergan Complaint for Indemnity
In 2019, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a complaint, along with King, 
filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, asserting claimsfor indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King in 2010.
 This suit was voluntarily discontinued withoutprejudice in January 2021.
Breach of Contract––Xalkori/Lorbrena
We
 are a defendant in a breach of contract action brought by New York University (NYU) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Supreme Court). NYU alleges that it isentitled
 to royalties on Pfizer’s sales of Xalkori under the terms of a Research and License Agreement between NYU and Sugen, Inc. Sugen, Inc. was acquired by Pharmacia inAugust 1999, and 
Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is  a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. The action was  originally filed in 2013. In 2015, the Supreme Court dismissedthe
 action and, in 2017, the New York State Appellate Division reversed the decision and remanded the proceedings to the Supreme Court. In January 2020, the Supreme Courtdenied both parties’ summary judgment motions.
In October 2020, NYU filed a
 separate breach of contract action against Pfizer alleging that it is entitled to royalties on sales of Lorbrena under the terms of the same NYU-Sugen, Inc.Research and Licensing Agreement. In February 2022, the parties reached an agreement to settle both breach o
f contract actions on terms not material to Pfizer.Viatris Securities Litigation
In October 2021, a putative class action was filed in the Court of
 Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on behalf of former Mylan N.V. shareholders who received Viatriscommon stock in exchange for Mylan shares in connection with the spin-off of the Upjohn Business and its combination with Mylan (the Transactions). Viatris, P
fizer, and certain ofeach company’s current and former officers, directors and employees are named as defendants. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated certain provisions of 
the SecuritiesAct of 1933 in connection with certain disclosures made in or omitted from the registration statement and related prospectus issued in connection with 
the Transactions. Plaintiff seeksdamages, costs and expenses and other equitable and injunctive relief.
A4. Legal Proceedings––Government Investigations
We are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges,
substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as
reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, in a
qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the
 government. Amongthe investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.
Greenstone Investigations
•
U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division InvestigationSince July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust
 Division has been investigating our former Greenstone generics business. We believe this is related to an ongoing broaderantitrust investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. We have produced records relating to this investigation.
•
State Attorneys General and Multi-District Generics Antitrust LitigationIn April 2018, Greenstone received requests for information from the Antitrust Department of the
 Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. In May 2019, Attorneys General of morethan 40 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer. The mat
ter has beenconsolidated with a Multi-District Litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the
 complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federaland state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. In June 2020,
 the State Attorneys General filed a new complaint against a large number of companies, includingGreenstone and Pfizer, making similar allegations, but concerning a new set of drugs. This complaint was transferred to the Multi-District Litigation in July 2020. The Multi-District
Litigation also includes civil complaints filed by private plaintiffs and state counties against Pfizer, Greenstone and a significant number of other defendan
ts asserting allegations thatgenerally overlap with those asserted by the State Attorneys General.
Subpoena relating to Manufacturing of Quillivant XR
In October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. A
ttorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our relationship with another drugmanufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR. We have produced records pursuant to
 the subpoena.Government Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies
In February 2019, we received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
 SDNY. The civil investigative demand seeks records and information related toalleged quality issues involving the manufacture of auto-injectors at the Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPA
A subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the EasternDistrict of Missouri seeking similar records and information. We are producing records in response to these requests.
U.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to Russian Operations
In June 2019, we received an informal request from the 
U.S. Department of Justice’s FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in Russia. In September 2019,  wereceived a similar request from the SEC’s FCPA Unit. We have produced records pursuant to these requests.

A5. Legal Proceedings––Matters Resolved During 2021
During 2021, certain matters, including the matter discussed below, were resolved or became the subject of definitive settlement agreements or settlement agreements-in-principle.
EpiPen
Beginning in 2017, purported class actions were filed in various federal courts by indirect purchasers of EpiPen against Pfizer, and/or its current and former affiliates King and
Meridian, and/or various entities affiliated with Mylan, and Mylan former Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch. The plaintiffs in these actions represent U.S.
 nationwide classescomprising persons or entities who paid for any portion of the end-user purchase price of an EpiPen between 2009 until the cessation of
 the defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct.Against Pfizer and/or its affiliates, plaintiffs in these actions generally allege that Pfizer’s and/or its a
ffiliates’ settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen delayed market entry ofgeneric EpiPen in violation of federal and various state antitrust laws. At least one lawsuit also alleges that 
Pfizer and/or Mylan violated RICO. Plaintiffs also filed various federalantitrust, state consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims against, and relating to conduct attributable solely to,
 Mylan and/or its affiliates regarding EpiPen. Plaintiffs seektreble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In 2017, all of these indirect purchase actions were consolidated for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District
Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas with other EpiPen-related actions against Mylan and/or its
 affiliates to which Pfizer, King and Meridian are not parties. InJuly 2021, Pfizer and plaintiffs filed a stipulation of settlement to resolve the Multi-District Litigation for $345 million. The District Court approved the settlement in November 2021, and
the payment was made in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement.
B. Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and
 other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities thatmay arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. I
f the indemnified party were to make a successful claimpursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically,
we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of December 31, 2021, the es
timated fair value of these indemnification obligations has been included in ourfinancial statements and is not material to Pfizer.
In addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may agree to indemnify us. For example, in November 2020, we and
 Mylancompleted the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of
 the transaction and as previously disclosed, Viatris has agreed toassume, and to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of certain matters.
We have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer. 
See Note 7D . C. Certain Commitments
As of December 31, 2021, we had commitments totaling $5.2 billion that are legally binding and enforceable. These commitments include payments relating to potential milestone
payments deemed reasonably likely to occur, and purchase obligations for goods and services.
See 
Note 5A for information on the TCJA repatriation tax liability. D. Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions
We may be required to make payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations that are contingent upon future events or outcomes. 
See Note 1E . The estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of December 31, 2021 is $697 million, of which $135 million is recorded in 
Other current liabilities  and $563 million in Other noncurrent liabilities, and as of December 31, 2020 is $689 million, of which $123 million is recorded in 
Other current liabilities  and $566 million in Other noncurrent liabilities . The increase in the contingent consideration balance from December 31, 2020 is primarily due to fair value adjustments, partially offset by payments made upon the achievement of certain sales-based milestones.
E. Insurance
Our insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-insure
varies accordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The
 cost and availabilityof coverage have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability.
 If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance or substantially exceedinsurance

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
coverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash
 flows or results of operations in the period in which the amounts are paidand/or accrued.
Note 17
. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue InformationA. Segment Information
We regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare
JV in 2019 and the completion of the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in the
 fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovativemedicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufac
turing, marketing, saleand distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our
commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based
biopharmaceutical business and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Biopharma is a science-based medicines business that includes six therapeutic areas – Oncology, Inflammation & Immunology, Rare Disease, Hospital, Vaccines and Internal
Medicine. The Hospital therapeutic area commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines.
Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global
platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. 
Biopharma receives its R&Dservices from GPD and WRDM. These services include IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each business has a
geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors,
for performance evaluation and resource allocation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. We have revised prior-period information (Revenues and Earnings, as defined by
management) to conform to the current management structure.
Other Costs and Business Activities
Certain pre-tax costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the
 following:•
WRDM––the R&D and Medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our Biopharma portfolio until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and
milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRDM organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which
provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which ensures that Pfizer provides all
stakeholders––including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities––with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated
with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use P
fizer’s medicines.•
GPD––the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including late-stage portfolio spend.GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory
agencies.
•
Corporate and Other Unallocated––the costs associated with (i) corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources,worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement, among others), all strategy, business development, portfolio management and valuation capabilities, patient
advocacy activities and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and
 losses on investments; (ii) overhead expensesprimarily associated with our manufacturing (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment,
as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs; and (iii) our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV.
•
Certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory,intangible assets and PP&E; (ii) acquisition-related items, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the acquired operations and restructuring the combined
company; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items (such as pension and postretirement actuarial
remeasurement gains and losses, gains on the completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or net gains and losses on investments in equity
securities) that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not
 be expected to occur as part of our normalbusiness on a regular basis. Such items can include, but are not limited to, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset
impairments and disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.
The operating results of PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization, and through July 31, 2019 our former Consumer Healthcare business are included in
Other business activities.
Segment Assets
We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as
 our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker doesnot regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $181 billion as of
December 31, 2021 and $154 billion as of December 31, 2020.

Deferred Revenues
Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable in connection with contracts that we entered into during 2021 and 2020 with various government or
government sponsored customers in international markets for supply of Comirnaty. The deferred revenues associated with the advance payments related to Comirnaty total $3.3

and ShareholdersPfizer Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control
— Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of theCompany as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and
 cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2022
 expressed anunqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to 
theCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAO
B. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whethereffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness o
f internal control basedon the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
 transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of 
the company; and (3) provide reasonableassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect
 on the financialstatements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation o
f effectiveness to futureperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or tha
t the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures maydeteriorate.

EXHIBIT 4.24DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12
 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934As of February 24, 2022 Pfizer Inc. has co
mmon stock, the 0.250% Notes due 2022 (the 2022 notes) and the 1.000% Notes due 2027 (the 2027 notes and togetherwith the 2022 notes, the notes) registered under 
Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The following descriptions of our common stock andthe notes are summaries and do not purport to be comp
lete. The description of our common stock is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our restatedcertificate of incorporat
ion (the Certificate of Incorporation), and our bylaws, as amended (the Bylaws), and the description of the notes is subject to and qualified in itsentirety by reference to the base indenture (a
s defined below) and the ninth supplemental indenture (as defined below), each of which are incorporated by reference asan exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10
-K of which this Exhibit 4.24 is a part. We encourage you to read our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, the applicableprovisions of the Dela
ware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), the base indenture and the ninth supplemental indenture for additional information. References inthis section to “Pfizer,
” “we,” “us” and “our” are to Pfizer Inc., unless otherwise stated or the context so requires.DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
Common Stock
Under the Certificate of Incorpo
ration, we are authorized to issue up to 12 billion shares of common stock, par value $0.05 per share. The common stock is notredeemable, does not have any conversion 
rights and is not subject to call. Holders of shares of common stock have no preemptive rights to maintain their percentageof ownership in future offerings o
r sales of our stock. Holders of shares of common stock have one vote per share in all elections of Directors and on all other matterssubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The ho
lders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as and when may be declared from time to time by ourBoard of Directors, out of funds lega
lly available therefor. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, the holders of common stock will be entitled toparticipate equally and ratab
ly, in proportion to the number of shares held, in our net assets available for distribution to holders of common stock. The shares ofcommon stock currently outstand
ing are fully paid and nonassessable. The common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “PFE.”Preferred Stock
Under the Certificate of Incorpo
ration, we are authorized to issue up to 27 million shares of preferred stock, without par value. The preferred stock may be issued inone or more series, and the Board of D
irectors of Pfizer is expressly authorized (i) to fix the descriptions, powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations, andrestrictions with 
respect to any series of preferred stock and (ii) to specify the number of shares of any series of preferred stock.Anti-takeover Effects of the 
Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and Delaware LawCertificate of Incorpora
tion and Bylaws. Various provisions containe d in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws could delay or discourage some transactionsinvolving an actual or potent
ial change in control of us or a change in our management and may limit the ability of our stockholders to remove current management orapprove transactions that our stockho
lders may deem to be in their best interests. Among other things, these provisions:    
•
limit the right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders to holders of at least 10% of the total number of shares of stock entitled to vote on thematter to be brought before the proposed special meet
ing;•
authorize our Board of Directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval;•
authorize the Board to issue dividends in the form of stock purchase or similar rights, including rights that would have the effect of making an attempt toacquire us more costly;
•
grant to the Board of Directors, and not to the stockholders, the sole power to set the number of Directors;•
require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders andmay not be effected by any consent in wr
iting; and1

•subject to the rights of the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock then outstanding, allow our Directors, and not our stockholders, to fill vacancieson our Board of Directors, in
cluding vacancies resulting from the removal of one or more Directors or an increase in the number of Directors constituting thewhole Board of Directors.
Delaware Law
. We are a Delaware corporat ion and consequently are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the DGCL. Subject to certain exceptions,Section 203 of the DGCL prevents a publ
icly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for three yearsfollowing the date that the person became an 
interested stockholder, unless (a) the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of the corporation’sboard of directors, (b) upon consummat
ion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned atleast 85% of the voting stock of the corpo
ration outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, exclusive of shares owned by directors who are also officers andby certain employee stock p
lans or (c) at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized by the affirmativevote at a stockholders’ meeting, and not b
y written consent, of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. A“business combination” 
includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than10% of the corporation’s assets. In gene
ral, an “interested stockholder” is any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding votingstock, and any entity or person affi
liated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person. Section 203 makes it more difficult for an interested stockholder toeffect various business comb
inations with a corporation for a three-year period. This statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in controlattempts not approved in advance by our Board of 
Directors, and, as a result, could discourage attempts to acquire us, which could depress the market price of ourcommon stock.
DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES
Reference should be made to the indenture dated as of Janua
ry 30, 2001, between Pfizer and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of NewYork), as successor to JP
Morgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, which we refer to as the “base indenture,” assupplemented by the ninth supplemental 
indenture dated as of March 6, 2017, among Pfizer Inc., The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, and The Bank of New YorkMellon, London Branch, as paying agent, 
which we refer to as the “ninth supplemental indenture.” When we refer to the “indenture,” we mean the base indenture, assupplemented by the ninth supplemental 
indenture. The following description is a summary of selected portions of the base indenture and the ninth supplementalindenture. It does not restate the base indenture or the ninth 
supplemental indenture, and those documents, not this description, define the rights of a holder of thenotes.
Principal, Maturity and Interest
The 2022 notes were limited to €1,000,000,000 aggregate pr
incipal amount and the 2027 notes were limited to €750,000,000 aggregate principal amount. The 2022notes will mature on Mar
ch 6, 2022 and the 2027 notes will mature on March 6, 2027. We issued the notes in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of€1,000 in excess thereof.
Interest on the 2022 notes accrues at the annual rate of 0.250% and 
interest on the 2027 notes accrues at the annual rate of 1.000%. Interest on the notes is payableon March 6 of each year. Interest on the notes is co
mputed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actualnumber of days from and including the 
last date on which interest was paid on the notes to, but excluding, the next scheduled interest payment date. This paymentconvention is referred 
to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association).We make each interest payment to the holde
rs of record of the notes at the close of business on the 15th calendar day (whether or not a business day) preceding therelevant interest payment date.
The Bank of New York Mel
lon, London Branch, acts as our paying agent with respect to the notes. Upon notice to the trustee, we may change any paying agent.Payments of principal, 
interest and premium, if any, will be made by us through the paying agent to Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the “Euroclear Operator”), as operator ofthe Euroclear System (“Eurocle
ar”) and/or Clearstream Banking, Société Anonyme, Luxembourg (“Clearstream”) as described under “—Book-Entry.”2

Issuance in EurosPrincipal, premiu
m, if any, and interest payments and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the notes are payable in euros.If the euro is unavailable to us due to the 
imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or the euro is no longer used by the then memberstates of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro a
s their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions within the internationalbanking community, then all pa
yments in respect of the notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances, theamount payable on any date in euros wi
ll be converted to U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros, as determined by usin our sole discretion. 
Any payment in respect of the notes so made in U.S. dollars does not constitute an event of default under the indenture or the notes. Neither thetrustee nor the paying agent is respons
ible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations.Payment of Additional Amounts
All payments in respect of the note
s are made by or on behalf of us without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties,assessments or governmental cha
rges of whatever nature, imposed or levied by the United States or any taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such withholding ordeduction is required by la
w. If such withholding or deduction is required by law, we pay to a beneficial owner who is not a United States person such additionalamounts on the notes as are necessary in orde
r that the net payment of the principal of, and premium or redemption price, if any, and interest on, such notes to suchbeneficial owner, after such 
withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction on such additional amounts), will not be less than the amount provided insuch notes to be then due and payable; provided, howeve

dividends and distributions to shareholders, current ratios or acquisitions and divestitures. The notes do not have the benefit of covenants that relate to subsidiaryguarantees, liens and sale leaseba
ck transactions that apply to other of our existing unsecured and unsubordinated notes.Pfizer may, without the consent of the ho
lders of notes of any series, issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and otherterms as the notes of any series (ex
cept for the issue date and the public offering price). Any additional notes having such similar terms, together with the notes of theapplicable series, 
will constitute a single series of debt securities under the indenture. No additional notes of any series may be issued if an event of default hasoccurred with respect to the notes of that se
ries. Pfizer will not issue any additional notes intended to form a single series with the notes of any series, unless suchfurther notes will be fu
ngible with all notes of the same series for U.S. federal income tax purposes.Optional Redemption of 2022 Notes and 2027 Notes
; Redemption for Tax Reasons; No Sinking FundAt our option, we may redeem the 2022 notes or the 2027 notes 
(together, the redemption notes), in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, prior to February6, 2022 (one month prior to the maturity date) 
with respect to the 2022 notes and December 6, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 2027notes. The redemption price wi
ll be equal to the greater of the following amounts:•
100% of the principal amount of the redemption notes being redeemed on the redemption date; and•
the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the redemption notes being redeemed on that redemptiondate (not including the amount, if any, of ac
crued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on an annualbasis at a rate equal to the sum of the Comparab
le Government Bond Rate plus (a) 15 basis points in the case of the 2022 notes and (b) 15 basis points inthe case of the 2027 notes;
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid 
interest on the redemption notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.At any time on or after February 6, 2022 (one month pr
ior to the maturity date) with respect to the 2022 notes and December 6, 2026 (three months prior to the maturitydate) with respect to the 2027 notes, we may 
redeem such series of redemption notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amountof the redemption notes to be redeemed, plus in each 
case, accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemptiondate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
installments of interest on the applicable redemption notes that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to aredemption date will be payab
le on the interest payment date to the registered holders as of the close of business on the relevant record date according to theapplicable redemption notes and the 
indenture. The redemption prices for the redemption notes will be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year or a 366-day year, asapplicable, and the actual number of day
s elapsed.We will mai
l notice of any redemption at least 10 days, but not more than 60 days, before the redemption date to each registered holder of the redemption notes to beredeemed. Once notice of redemption is 
mailed, the redemption notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the redemption date at the applicableredemption price, plus acc
rued and unpaid interest applicable to such redemption notes to, but excluding, the redemption date.“Comparable Government Bond” mean
s, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an Independent Investment Banker, aGerman government bond whose maturity 
is closest to the maturity of the redemption notes to be redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its discretiondetermines that such simi
lar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such Independent Investment Banker may, with the advice of three brokersof, and/or market makers in, German gove
rnment bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.“Comparable Government Bond Rate
” means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at whichthe gross redemption yield on the f
ixed rate notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third business day prior to the date fixed forredemption, would be equal to the gross 
redemption yield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of the middle market price of theComparable Government Bond preva
iling at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an Independent Investment Banker.5

“Independent Investment Banker” means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by us to act as the “Independent Investment Banker.”“Reference Treasury Dealer” m
eans each of Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (or their respective affiliates thatare Primary Treasury 
Dealers), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a broker or dealer of, and/or marketmaker in, German gover
nment bonds (a “Primary Treasury Dealer”), we will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.On and after the redemption date, interest wi
ll cease to accrue on the redemption notes or any portion of the redemption notes called for redemption (unless we defaultin the payment of the redemption price and ac
crued and unpaid interest). On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with a paying agent (or the trustee) moneysufficient to pay the redemption pr
ice of and accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption notes to be redeemed on that date. If fewer than all of the redemptionnotes of any series are to be redeemed, the redempt
ion notes to be redeemed shall be selected by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of redemption notesrepresented by a global securit
y, or by the trustee by a method the trustee deems to be fair and appropriate, in the case of redemption notes that are not representedby a global security.
The notes are not entitled to the benefit of a sink
ing fund.Redemption for Tax Reasons
If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the 
laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the United States (or any taxing authoritythereof or therein), or any change in, or amend
ments to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which changeor amendment is announced or becomes effect
ive on or after February 28, 2017, we become or, based upon a written opinion of independent tax counsel ofrecognized standing selected by u
s, will become obligated to pay additional amounts as described herein under the heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts” withrespect to any series of the notes, then we ma
y at our option, having given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior notice to holders, redeem, in whole, but not inpart, the applicable series of note
s at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including any additionalamounts) on such notes to, but excluding, the rede
mption date.Book-Entry
Global Clearance and Set
tlementThe notes of each series were is
sued in the form of one or more global notes in fully registered form, without coupons, and are deposited with, or on behalf of, acommon depositary, and registered 
in the name of the nominee of the common depositary, for, and in respect of interests held through, Euroclear and Clearstream.Except as described herein, ce
rtificates will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes representing the notes.Except as set forth below, the globa
l notes representing the notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respectivenominees.
Beneficial interests 
in the global notes representing the notes are represented, and transfers of such beneficial interests are effected, through accounts of financialinstitutions acting on b
ehalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in Euroclear or Clearstream. Those beneficial interests are in denominations of€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 
in excess thereof. Investors may hold the notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in suchsystems, or indirect
ly through organizations that are participants in such systems.For so long as any series of the notes 
is represented by a global note deposited with, and registered in the name of a nominee for, a common depositary for Euroclearand/or Clearstream, each person (othe
r than Euroclear or Clearstream) who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear or of Clearstream as the holder of aparticular nominal amount of the note
s (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by Euroclear or Clearstream as to the nominal amount of the notesstanding to the account of any person shall be 
conclusive and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error) shall upon their receipt of a certificate or otherdocument be treated by Pfizer and the trustee as the ho
lder of such nominal amount of the notes and the registered holder of the global note representing such notesshall be deemed not to be the holder for al
l purposes other than with respect to the payment of principal or interest on such nominal amount of the notes, for whichpurpose the registered holder of the rele
vant global note shall be treated by Pfizer and the trustee as the holder of such nominal amount of notes in6

accordance with and subject to the terms of the global note representing the notes, and the expressions “noteholder” and “holder of notes” and related expressionsshall be construed accor
dingly.The information in this sect
ion concerning Euroclear and Clearstream Banking and their book-entry systems and procedures has been obtained from sources that webelieve to be reliable. We 
are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of this information.We have been advised
 by Clearstream and Euroclear, respectively, as follows:Clearstream has advised that:
    
•
It is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and licensed as a bank and professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participatingorganizations and facil
itates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accountsof its participants, thereby e
liminating the need for physical movement of certificates.•
Clearstream provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally tradedsecurities and securities lending
 and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries.•
Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with the Euroclear Operator to facilitate the settlement of trades between the nominees of Clearstream andEuroclear.
•
As a registered bank in Luxembourg, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector.•
Clearstream customers are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,clearing corporations and
 certain other organizations and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such asbanks, brokers, dealers and trust co
mpanies that clear through, or maintain a custodial relationship with, a Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.Distributions with respect to t
he notes held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream participants in accordance with its rulesand procedures.
Euroclear has advised that:
•
It was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronicbook-entry delivery again
st payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers ofsecurities and cash.
•
Euroclear includes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries.•
Euroclear is operated by the Euroclear Operator. All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts andEuroclear cash accounts are ac
counts with the Euroclear Operator.•
Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and therelated operating pr
ocedures of Euroclear, and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfersof securities and cash within
 Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. Allsecurities in Euroclear are held
 on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operatoracts under the Terms and Conditions on
ly on behalf of Euroclear participants, and has no records of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclearparticipants.
•
Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries and may includethe underwriters. Indirec
t access to Euroclear is also7

available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly.Distributions w
ith respect to the notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with the Termsand Conditions.
Euroclear and Clearstream Arra
ngementsSo long as Euroclear or C
learstream or their nominee or their common depositary is the registered holder of the global notes representing the notes, Euroclear,Clearstream or such nom
inee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such global notes for all purposes underthe indenture and the notes. Payments of princ
ipal, interest and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the global notes representing the notes are made to Euroclear,Clearstream, such nominee o
r such common depositary, as the case may be, as registered holder thereof. Neither Pfizer nor the trustee, or any affiliate of any of theabove or any person by whom any of the above i
s controlled (as such term is defined in the Securities Act) has any responsibility or liability for any records relating toor payments made on account of beneficia
l ownership interests in the global notes representing the notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any recordsrelating to such ben
eficial ownership interests.Distributions of pr
incipal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the global notes representing the notes are credited in euros to the extent received by Euroclearor Clearstream from the pay
ing agent to the cash accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream customers in accordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures.Because Euroclear and Clea
rstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a person having an interest inthe global notes representing the notes to pledge 
such interest to persons or entities which do not participate in the relevant clearing system, or otherwise take actionsin respect of such interest, may be affe
cted by the lack of a physical certificate in respect of such interest.Secondary Market Trading
Because the purchaser determines the p
lace of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any notes where both the purchaser’s and seller’s accountsare located to ensure that settlement can be made on the des
ired value date.We understand tha
t secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants occurs in the ordinary way following the applicable rules andoperating procedures of Clearst
ream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading is settled using procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in global registeredform.
The holder of the notes should be aware that inve
stors are only able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving the notes throughClearstream and Euroclea
r on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and otherinstitutions are open for busine
ss in the United States.In addition, because of time-zone diffe
rences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the same business day asin the United States. U.S. in
vestors who wish to transfer their interests in the notes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of the notes, on a particular day, mayfind that the transactions are not performed unt
il the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used.Clearstream or Euroclear credits 
payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, in accordance with the relevantsystem’s rules and procedu
res, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case may be, takes any other action permitted tobe taken by a holder under the indenture on behalf of a C
learstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures.Clearstream and Euroclea
r have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the notes among participants of Clearstream and Euroclear.However, they are under no obligat
ion to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may discontinue those procedures at any time.8

Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated NotesSubject to certain condition
s, the notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimumdenominations of €100,000 principa
l amount and multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof if:•
the common depositary notifies us that it is no longer willing or able to act as a depositary for such global notes or ceases to be a clearing agency registeredunder the Exchange Act and we fail to appo
int a successor common depositary within 90 days;•
an event of default has occurred and is continuing and the common depositary requests the issuance of certificated notes; or•
we determine not to have the notes represented by a global note.In all cases, certifi
cated notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interest therein will be registered in the names, and issued in any approveddenominations, requested by or on behalf of the co
mmon depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures).Payments (including pr
incipal, premium and interest) and transfers with respect to the notes in certificated form may be executed at the office or agency maintained forsuch purpose in London (initia
lly the corporate trust office of the paying agent) or, at our option, by check mailed to the holders thereof at the respective addresses setforth in the register of holders of the notes 
(maintained by the registrar), provided that all payments (including principal, premium and interest) on the notes incertificated form, for wh
ich the holders thereof have given wire transfer instructions, are required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to theaccounts specified by the holder
s thereof. No service charge is made for any registration of transfer, but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmentalcharge payable in con
nection with such registration may be required.Modification of Indenture
Under the indenture, the rights of the holder
s of the notes may be modified through a supplemental indenture if the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amountof the outstanding notes of all series affe
cted by the modification (voting as one class) consent to it. No modification of the maturity date or principal or interest paymentterms, no modification of the cur
rency for payment, no impairment of the right to sue for the enforcement of payment at the maturity of the debt security, no modificationof any conversion rights, no mod
ification reducing the percentage required for any such supplemental indenture or the percentage required for the waiver of certaindefaults, and no modification of the forego
ing provisions or any other provisions relating to the waiver of past defaults or the waiver of certain covenants, is effectiveagainst any holder witho
ut its consent.Events of Default
Each of the following w
ill constitute an Event of Default under the indenture with respect to the notes of the applicable series:•
we fail to make the principal or any premium payment on any note of such series when due;•
we fail to make any sinking fund payment for 60 days after payment was due by the terms of any note of such series;•
we fail to pay interest on any note of such series for 60 days after payment was due;•
we fail to perform any other covenant in the indenture and this failure continues for 90 days after we receive written notice of it; or•
we, or a court, take certain actions relating to the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of our company.A default under our other indebtedness w
ill not be a default under the indenture for the notes, and a default under one series of the notes will not necessarily be adefault under another series. The trustee may 
withhold notice to the holders of notes of the applicable series of any default (except for defaults that involve our failureto pay principal or intere
st) if it considers such withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders.9

If an Event of Default with respect to outstanding notes of any series occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 33% in principal amount ofoutstanding notes of that series may dec
lare, in a written notice, the principal amount (or, if any of the notes of that series are original issue discount securities, suchportion of the principal amount of su
ch notes) plus accrued and unpaid interest on all notes of that series to be immediately due and payable. At any time after adeclaration of acceleration 
with respect to notes of any series has been made, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of such series mayrescind and annul th
e acceleration if:•
the holders act before the trustee has obtained a judgment or decree for payment of the money due;•
we have paid or deposited with the trustee a sum sufficient to pay overdue interest and overdue principal other than the accelerated interest and principal; and•
we have cured or the holders have waived all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal and interest with respect to notes of thatseries, as provided in th
e indenture.If a default in the performance or breach of the indentu
re shall have occurred and be continuing, the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of theoutstanding notes of all series affe
cted thereby, by notice to the trustee, may waive any past Event of Default or its consequences under the indenture. However, anEvent of Default cannot be waived 
with respect to any series of notes in the following two circumstances:     •
a failure to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on any security or in the payment of any sinking fund installment; or•
a covenant or provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of outstanding notes of that series.Other than its duties in case of a default, the t
rustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request, order or direction of anyholders, unless the holders offer the t
rustee reasonable indemnity. Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of any series of notes may, subject to certainlimitations, dire
ct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding or any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any power conferred upon the trustee,for such applicable series o
f notes.We are required to deliver an annua
l officers’ certificate to the trustee, stating whether we are in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms,provisions and condition
s of the indenture, and, if we are in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof.Defeasance
When we use the term defeasance, we mean d
ischarge from some or all of our obligations under the indenture. Subject to certain additional conditions, if weirrevocably deposit 
with the trustee sufficient cash or government securities to pay the principal, interest, any premium and any other sums due to the stated maturitydate or a redemption date of the notes of a particular 
series, then at our option:•
we will be discharged from our obligations with respect to the notes of such series; or•
we will no longer be under any obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants under the indenture, and certain events of default will no longer apply tous.
To exercise our defeasance option, we 
must deliver to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent related tothe defeasance have been complied with.
