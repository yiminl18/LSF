PART I 
  Item 1.  Business 
General 
Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s 
leading providers of communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and 
government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms 
that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000). 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon 
Business Group (Business). 
On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of our media business, Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media), to an affiliate of Apollo Global 
Management Inc. Additional information is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and 
Subsidiaries. 
Verizon Consumer Group 
Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are 
provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and 
other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are 
provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through 
our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. On November 23, 
2021, we completed the acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), a provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. 
Additional information is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries. 
In 2021, the Consumer segment’s revenues were $95.3 billion, representing approximately 71% of Verizon’s consolidated revenues. As of 
December 31, 2021, Consumer had approximately 115 million wireless retail connections, approximately 7 million wireline broadband 
connections, which includes Fios and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) internet connections, and approximately 4 million Fios video 
connections. 
Verizon Business Group 
Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, 
corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver 
various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these 
products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services 
to customers around the world. 
In 2021, the Business segment's revenues were $31.0 billion, representing approximately 23% of Verizon’s consolidated revenues. As of 
December 31, 2021, Business had approximately 27 million wireless retail postpaid connections and approximately 477 thousand wireline 
broadband connections, which includes Fios and DSL internet connections. 
Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in Item 7. under the headings "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" and - "Segment Results of Operations" and in Note 13 to the consolidated 
financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries. 
Service and Product Offerings 
Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase 
wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by 
the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings: Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and 
Wholesale. 
Wireless 
We offer wireless services and equipment to both Consumer customers and Business customers. 
Wireless Services 
Our Consumer and Business segments provide a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Customers can 
obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers that 
4
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
are directly served and managed by Verizon and use Verizon branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a 
variety of connected devices. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to 
and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services 
without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. As of December 31, 2021, we had 24 million prepaid connections, which 
include approximately 20 million Consumer prepaid connections due to the Tracfone acquisition. Approximately 79% of our Consumer 
wireless retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2021. 
We offer various postpaid and prepaid service plans tailored to the needs of our customers. Depending on those needs at a particular time, our 
plans may include features related to, among other things: unlimited or metered domestic and/or international voice, data, and texting; the 
ability to share data allowances and/or use data allowances in different periods; high definition voice and video features; premium content; the 
ability to use a device as a Wi-Fi hotspot; and varying data rates depending on the plan and usage on that plan. Our service offerings vary 
from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of 
limited time promotional offers. 
Access to the internet is available on all smartphones and nearly all basic phones. In addition, our customers can access the internet at 
broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that are either wireless-enabled or that are used in conjunction with separate dedicated 
devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. 
We no longer offer Consumer customers new fixed-term, subsidized service plans for devices; however, we continue to offer subsidized plans 
to our Business customers. 
Wireless Equipment 
Consumer and Business offer several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, 
wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches. We permit customers 
to acquire equipment from us using device payment plans, which permit the customer to pay for the device in installments over time. 
Verizon Consumer Group 
In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Consumer sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, 
video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis. Consumer also provides non-connectivity services 
including device protection, cloud storage, and other products. 
Residential Fixed Services. We provide residential fixed connectivity solutions to customers over our 100% fiber-optic network through our 
Verizon Fios product portfolio, and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. As of December 31, 
2021, fifth-generation (5G) fixed wireless technology for the home (5G Home) is available in parts of 65 U.S. cities. In addition, as of 
December 31, 2021, our Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Home fixed wireless access internet service is available in parts of all 50 states across 
the United States. 
We offer residential fixed services tailored to the needs of our customers. Depending on those needs at a particular time, our services may 
include features related to, among other things: internet access at different speed tiers using fiber-optic, copper or wireless technology; video 
services that may feature a variety of channel options, video on demand products, cloud-based services and digital video recording 
capabilities; over-the-top video services; voice services; and other home solutions. 
Network Access Services. We sell network access to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) on a wholesale basis, who in turn resell 
wireless service under their own brand(s) to consumers. Our largest such arrangement was with Tracfone, until we acquired Tracfone from 
América Móvil in November 2021. 
Verizon Business Group 
In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications 
services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network 
services, local and long-distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. 
Small and Medium Business 
Small and Medium Business offers wireless services and equipment, conferencing services, tailored voice and networking products, Fios 
services, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, advanced voice solutions and security and managed information technology (IT) services to our 
U.S.-based small and medium businesses that do not meet the requirements to be categorized as Global Enterprise, as described below. In 
2021, Small and Medium Business revenues were $11.8 billion, representing approximately 38% of Business’s total revenues. 
In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Small and Medium Business provides fixed connectivity solutions 
comparable to the residential fixed services provided by Consumer, as well as business services and connectivity similar to the products and 
services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case with features and pricing designed to address the needs of small and medium businesses.
5
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Global Enterprise 
Global Enterprise offers services to large businesses, which are identified based on their size and volume of business with Verizon, as well as 
non-U.S. public sector customers. In 2021, Global Enterprise revenues were $10.2 billion, representing approximately 33% of Business’s total 
revenues. 
Global Enterprise offers a broad portfolio of connectivity, security and professional services designed to enable our customers to optimize 
their business operations, mitigate business risks and capitalize on data. These services include the following: 
• Network Services. We offer a portfolio of network connectivity products to help our customers connect with their employees, 
partners, vendors and customers. These products include private networking services, private cloud connectivity services, virtual 
and software defined networking services and internet access services. 
• Advanced Communications Services. We offer a suite of services to our customers to help them communicate with their employees, 
partners, vendors, constituents and customers. These products include IP-based voice and video services, unified communications 
and collaboration tools and customer contact center solutions. 
• Security services. We offer a suite of management and data security services that help our customers protect, detect and respond to 
security threats to their networks, data, applications and infrastructure. 
• Core services. We provide a portfolio of domestic and global voice and data solutions utilizing traditional telecommunications 
technology, including voice calling, messaging services, conferencing, contact center solutions and private line and data access 
networks. Core services also include the provision of customer premises equipment, and installation, maintenance and site services. 
• IoT services. We provide the network access required to deliver various IoT products and services. We work with companies that 
purchase network access from us to connect their devices, bundled together with their own solutions, which they sell to end users. 
We are building IoT capabilities by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity, platform 
and solution layers. 
Public Sector and Other 
Public Sector and Other offers wireless products and services as well as wireline connectivity and managed solutions to U.S. federal, state and 
local governments and educational institutions. These services include business services and connectivity similar to the products and services 
offered by Global Enterprise, in each case, with features and pricing designed to address the needs of governments and educational 
institutions. In 2021, Public Sector and Other revenues were $6.3 billion, representing approximately 20% of Business’s total revenues. 
Public Sector and Other also includes solutions that support fleet tracking management, compliance management, field service management, 
asset tracking and other types of mobile resource management in the U.S. and around the world. 
Wholesale 
Wholesale offers wireline communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long 
distance, and wireless carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2021, Wholesale revenues were $2.7 billion, 
representing approximately 9% of Business’s total revenues. A portion of Wholesale revenues are generated by a few large 
telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. Wholesale's services include: 
• Data services. We offer a portfolio of data services to enhance our Wholesale customers’ networks and provide connections to their 
end-users and subscribers. 
• Voice services. We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user calls that originate or terminate 
within our territory. In addition, we provide originating and terminating voice services throughout the U.S. and globally utilizing 
our time-division multiplexing and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) networks. 
• Local services. We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which 
are offered to comply with telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as colocation, resale and unbundled 
network elements in compliance with applicable regulations. 
Distribution 
We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services to Consumer 
and Business customers. 
Our direct channel, including our company-operated stores, is a core component of our distribution strategy. Our sales and service centers and 
business direct sales teams also represent significant distribution channels for our services. In addition, we have a robust digital channel and 
omni-channel experience for our customers in order to offer choice and convenience.
6
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our wireless and wireline products and services at retail locations throughout the U.S., as well as 
through the internet. The majority of these sales are made under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with high-
profile national retailers that sell our wireless and wireline products and services, as well as convenience store chains that sell our wireless 
prepaid products and services. 
In addition to our direct channel, our Business segment has additional distribution channels that include business solution fulfillment provided 
by resellers, non-stocked device fulfillment performed by distributors and integrated mobility services provided by system integrators and 
resellers. 
Competition and Related Trends 
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional 
participants seek increased market share. 
With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, including 
AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with 
resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers include 
cable companies and others. Competition remains intense as a result of high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market, increased 
network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, including 5G, the introduction of new 
products and services, offerings that include additional bundled premium content, increased levels of promotions and service plan discounts, 
new market entrants, the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum and regulatory changes. In addition, increasing 
government incentives related to network deployment may enhance the ability of certain of our competitors to compete with us. Competition 
may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service 
providers and as MVNOs resell wireless communication services. In addition, DISH Network has committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G 
broadband network in each of its license areas capable of serving at least 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 2023, which could result 
in additional competitive pressures in the U.S. wireless industry. 
We also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture 
customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For 
example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and 
making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service, as well as alternative means of 
accessing video content. In addition, we expect to see increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite 
companies. 
With respect to our wireline connectivity services, we compete against cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign 
telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service providers, over-the-top (OTT) providers and other companies 
that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order 
to deliver digital products and services. Several major cable operators offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. 
Traditional wireless carriers are also bundling broadband internet offerings with wireless services while increasing their broadband internet 
footprint. Customers have an increasing number of choices for obtaining video content from various online services. We expect the market 
will continue to shift from traditional linear video to OTT offerings. We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless 
services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a 
landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of VoIP services as well as internet portal 
providers. 
We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry: 
• Network reliability, speed and coverage. We consider networks that consistently provide high-quality, fast and reliable service to be 
a key differentiator in the market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new service 
offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of connectivity services. We and other 
network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity usage requirements and offer highly 
reliable national coverage. 
• Pricing. With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As 
the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive 
prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with other content and offer promotional pricing and 
incentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of Verizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as 
equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a 
period of time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more 
common in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers. Pricing also plays an important role in the 
wireline competitive landscape, as traditional service providers compete aggressively in offerings such as IP Networking, Core 
Voice and other legacy products. In addition, as non-traditional modes of providing wireline communication services emerge, new 
entrants attempt to capture market share from incumbents using competitive pricing. For example, VoIP and portal-based voice and 
video calling is often free or nearly free for customers and supported by advertising revenues.
7
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
• Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new 
customers, including those of other providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing 
customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term 
relationships and minimize churn. 
Customer service is highly valued by our Business customers. We provide Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other customers 
with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our networks to identify issues 
before they affect our customers. We service our Small and Medium Business customers through service representatives and online 
support, as well as through store-based representatives for small business customers. For Wholesale customers, we pursue service 
improvement through continued system automation initiatives. 
• Product differentiation.  Customer and revenue growth are increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced 
products and services, as the delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. Customers are shifting 
their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband, video and wireless connections. To 
compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly 
deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment 
of new and innovative products and services, both independently and in collaboration with application providers, content providers 
and device manufacturers. Features such as wireless and wireline inter-operability are becoming increasingly important, driven by 
both customer demand and technological advancement. 
• Sales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the wireless 
industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We seek to optimally vary distribution channels among 
our company-operated stores selling wireless products and services, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, outside sales 
teams and telemarketing, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and our sale of wireless service to resellers, 
which resell wireless services to their end-users. 
In addition to these competitive factors and trends, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our Business 
segment. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the 
global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide 
integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand 
recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth.  
In the Small and Medium Business market, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity 
with user interfaces that have a consumer-like "look and feel" are becoming key differentiators for customers who are seeking full life-cycle 
offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing their businesses. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with 
wireless services through strategic relationships. 
In the Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other markets, competition levels remain high, primarily as a result of increased industry focus 
on technology convergence. We compete in this area with system integrators, carriers, and hardware and software providers. In addition, 
some of the largest information technology services companies are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets and forging 
new alliances to improve their cost structure. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, 
software defined networking, communication applications and other computing tasks via networks, rather than by the use of in-house 
machines. 
Our Wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are 
driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this business 
opportunity. 
Gl
obal Network and Technology 
Our global network architecture is used by Consumer and Business. Our network technology platforms include both wireless and wireline 
technologies. 
Network Evolution 
We are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and virtualization, 
increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. 
We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless 
technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost -efficient manner. 
5G Deployment 
Over 
the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed 
and mobile 5G wireless services. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the current fourth-
generation (4G) LTE technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. As of 
December 31, 2021, 5G Ultra Wideband is available in parts of 87 U.S. cities and 5G Home is available in parts of 65 U.S. cities. Our FWA

broadband service continued to grow during the year with a customer base of approximately 223 thousand as of December 31, 2021. In 
January 2022, we successfully deployed C-Band spectrum, reaching approximately 100 million people in the U.S. as of February 2022. 
5G Nationwide uses low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, which allows 5G service to run 
simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s high-band Ultra Wideband 
coverage area, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum bands where the 5G Nationwide network is 
available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4G and 5G customers. 
4G LTE 
The wireless network technology platform that carries the majority of our wireless traffic is 4G LTE, which provides higher data throughput 
performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technology. As of December 31, 2021, our 4G LTE network 
covers approximately 328 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we have 
collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier’s network assets with our core 4G 
LTE equipment and 700 Megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. LTE Home Internet, our home 
broadband internet service, leverages the Verizon 4G LTE network. 
Wireless Network Reliability and Build-Out 
We consider the reliability, coverage and speed of our wireless network to be key factors for our continued success. We believe that steady 
and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services. As we design and deploy our 
network, we focus on the number of successful data sessions the network enables, delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and the 
number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We utilize three strategies to maintain the 
quality of our network: increasing the density of our network elements, deploying new technologies as they are developed and putting 
additional wireless spectrum into service. 
We have been densifying our network by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network 
densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and 
services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. We are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting 
the quality of the customer experience. We continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates. 
In order to build and upgrade our existing 4G LTE network and deploy our 5G network, we must secure rights to a large number of sites and 
obtain zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for our macro and small cells, in-building systems and antennas and 
related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various 
products and services that support our wireless network operations. We utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a 
portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites. 
Our networks in the U.S. include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of the services provided to our 
customers. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macro cell. We 
also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup 
generators that can be deployed if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone 
network in critical locations. 
In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers 
to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international 
wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside the U.S. 
Fios 
Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will 
continue to grow. We expect the continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the 
home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network 
(PON) technology underpinning Fios positions us well to meet these demands in a cost-effective and efficient manner. 
While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our PON infrastructure is also experiencing more widespread application in the 
Business segment, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services. 
Global IP 
Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber-optic networks in the world, providing connectivity to Business customers in more 
than 180 countries. Our global IP network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that enable and support international operations. 
Global business is rapidly evolving to an "everything-as-a-service" model in which Business customers seek cloud-based, converged 
enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. We are continuing to deploy packet optical transport 
technology in order to create a global network platform to meet this demand.

Spectrum 
The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile and fixed wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by 
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular 
spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C-
Band and AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the U.S. We 
have also deployed 4G technologies in 3.5 Gigahertz (GHz) shared spectrum, using LTE/Citizens Broadband Radio Service, and in 5 GHz 
unlicensed spectrum, using LTE/Licensed Assisted Access. All of this spectrum is collectively called low and mid-band spectrum. We are 
using our low and mid-band spectrum to provide 3G, 4G LTE and 5G wireless services. We are increasingly reallocating spectrum previously 
used for 3G service to provide 4G LTE service. We are also utilizing low and mid-band spectrum through DSS for 5G to complement our 
spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 GHz band, collectively called millimeter wave spectrum. In 2021, we acquired an average of 161 MHz of 
new mid-band spectrum in the continental United States in the 3700-3980 MHz band, also known as C-Band. We began using C-Band for 5G 
service in January 2022. 
Millimeter wave spectrum is being used in conjunction with low and mid-band spectrum for our 5G technology deployment. We own 
millimeter wave spectrum predominantly in the 28 GHz and 37/39 GHz bands. Millimeter wave spectrum is currently being used to increase 
capacity for mobile and fixed wireless services in areas of high demand. We anticipate that demand will continue to increase over time, driven 
by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of 
speed, as well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services. We expect to meet the demand for 4G and 5G spectrum needs with 
our existing spectrum assets. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can 
meet that demand by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and 
when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. 
From time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. 
We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. 
In certain cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency 
bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps, as well as any spectrum 
purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals. 
Information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon 
Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries. 
Human Capital Resources1 
At Verizon, we know that our people are one of our most valuable assets. In order to realize our core business strategy, we have developed 
human capital programs and practices that support, develop and care for our employees from the time they join our team through the entirety 
of their careers with Verizon. These programs are centered on the following principles: 
• Attract the right talent for our future and maintain a diverse workforce with high-value skills and expertise. 
• Develop our employees to their full potential through best-in-class educational programs and exceptional development experiences 
and create a culture of continuous learning and engagement. 
• Inspire individuals to build a career at Verizon by providing meaningful work and upskilling opportunities and establishing an 
inclusive work environment for all. 
Verizon is committed to being an employer of choice. With approximately 118,400 employees, including approximately 800 Tracfone 
employees, on a full-time equivalent basis as of December 31, 2021, 89% of whom are based in the U.S., we know that we need employees 
with diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to help us understand and connect more meaningfully to the diverse customers and 
communities we serve. Our human capital programs and practices are designed to create a workplace where employees are empowered to 
share their authentic selves and feel seen and heard as vital contributors to Verizon’s corporate purpose. In addition, Verizon has extensive 
on-the-job training opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs and career development support to enable our employees to maximize their 
potential and thrive professionally. Guided by our long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, our hiring and outreach programs 
have resulted in a strong representation of women and people of color. As of December 31, 2021, Verizon's global workforce was 
approximately 66.9% male and 33.1% female, and the race/ethnicity of our U.S. workforce was 53.9% White, 20.1% Black, 11.9% Hispanic, 
8.0% Asian, 0.4% American Indian/Alaskan Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 2.6% two or more races, and 2.8% unknown or 
undeclared. Women represented 38.7% of U.S. senior leadership (vice president level and above). People of color represented 34.9% of U.S. 
senior leadership.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Verizon respects our employees’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with applicable law, including the 
right to join or not join labor unions. We have a long history of working with the Communications Workers of America and the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers—the two unions that in total represent approximately 24.0% of our employees as of December 31, 2021. 
The current collective bargaining agreements covering our union- represented employees who serve customers in our Mid-Atlantic and 
Northeast service areas extend through August 5, 2023. In addition, where applicable outside of the U.S., we engage with employee 
representative bodies such as works council. Verizon meets with U.S. national and local union leaders, as well as works council leaders 
outside the U.S., to talk about key business topics, including safety, customer service, plans to improve operational processes, our business 
performance and the impacts that changing technology and competition are having on our customers, employees and business strategy. 
For a discussion of the oversight provided by the Verizon Board of Directors over the Company’s human capital management practices, see 
the section entitled "Governance — Our Approach to Governance — Our Approach to Strategy and Risk Oversight — Oversight of Human 
Capital Management" in our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to 
shareholders in connection with our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct 
our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names to protect our intellectual 
property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration 
and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights 
and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of Verizon's brands and 
the results of Verizon’s research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration for Verizon, we do not believe 
that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of 
operations. 
We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange 
for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or 
other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we sell 
to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, rebrand, or cease offering the relevant products or services. 
Regulatory and Competitive Trends 
Regulatory and Competitive Landscape 
Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer regulatory 
constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate 
telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other 
Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation. 
Federal, State and Local Regulation 
Wireless Services 
The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition 
and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and 
distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of 
technology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a 
competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential 
conditions. 
Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including 
both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the 
FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not 
renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to 
comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use 
devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on 
wireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 
services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. 
The Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does 
not prohibit states from regulating the other "terms and conditions" of wireless service. For example, some states impose reporting 
requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation 
matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing 
approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Broadband 
Verizon offers many different broadband services. The FCC currently recognizes broadband internet access services as "information services" 
subject to a "light touch" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. However, the FCC could return to a 
more utilities-style regulation of broadband. Additionally, a number of states have taken steps to attempt to regulate broadband and two of 
those cases related to regulations in California and Vermont are being litigated in the courts. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains 
committed to the open internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. 
Our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-
commitment . 
Wireline Voice 
Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such 
as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be "common carrier" services. Common carrier 
services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC 
has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 
capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. 
State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. 
Verizon operates as an "incumbent local exchange carrier" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject 
to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more 
lightly regulated. 
Video 
Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable 
operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, 
Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply 
with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. 
Privacy and Data Security 
We are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our 
business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the artificial intelligence 
and IoT space. At the federal level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), depending on the product 
or service. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, 
which went into effect in January 2020, both include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, other states and countries have 
continued to adopt new privacy laws that apply to us. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels 
of government globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These regulations 
could have a significant impact on our businesses. 
Public Safety and Cybersecurity 
The FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread 
availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could 
occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. The 
FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national 
security risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent 
natural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters; for example, 
the California Public Utilities Commission has imposed regulations on back-up power for communications facilities. 
Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access 
The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over 
different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and 
conditions for certain wireline "business data services" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these 
services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms 
and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate. 
Regulatory Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
Since the time that COVID-19 began to spread throughout the world in 2020, Verizon has been subject to various international, federal, state 
and local policies, regulations and initiatives aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease and protecting the health and safety of the 
world’s population. In addition, governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, 
including telecommunications companies, can operate their business and interact with their customers. Because the severity, magnitude and 
duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing, the impact of the crisis and the 
governmental responses to the crisis on our business in 2022 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to predict.

  Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
The following discussion of "Risk Factors" identifies factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future 
performance. This information should be read in conjunction with "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Result of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is 
designed to highlight what we believe are the material factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could 
cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. 
Operational Risks 
Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business. 
Cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, distributed denial of services attacks, ransomware attacks, credential 
harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems 
and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause 
equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and 
marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have 
increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially 
where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and 
requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication. While, to date, we have not been subject 
to cyber attacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's operations or financial condition, the preventive actions 
we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or 
mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. 
The inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber 
attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to our competitors. The 
costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners 
to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business 
interruption and litigation. Further, certain of Verizon’s businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud 
services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a 
result of a cyber attack. Our presence in the IoT industry, which includes offerings of telematics products and services, could also increase our 
exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, 
a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal 
information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our 
reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on Verizon’s results of operation or 
financial condition. 
Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions or terrorist or other hostile acts could cause damage to our infrastructure 
and result in significant disruptions to our operations. 
Our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, terrorist or other hostile acts, natural disasters or the potential impacts of 
climate change, including the increasing prevalence and intensity of hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, hail and storms. Such events could cause 
significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our 
customers, as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or 
inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events. We are implementing, and will continue to implement, measures to protect our 
infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these events in the future, but these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may 
not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment 
and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. These occurrences could result in lost revenues from 
business interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits. 
Public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially adversely affect our business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 
We are subject to risks related to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which had an adverse effect on our operating results 
in 2020. Our business is based on our ability to provide products and services to customers throughout the United States and around the world 
and the ability of those customers to use and pay for those products and services for their businesses and in their daily lives. As a result, our 
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by a crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic, that 
significantly impacts the way customers use and are able to pay for our products and services, the way our employees are able to provide 
services to our customers, and the ways that our partners and suppliers are able to provide products and services to us. For example, public 
and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and initiatives Verizon took in response to the health crisis 
to promote the health and safety of our employees and provide critical infrastructure and connectivity to our customers, along with the related 
14
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
global slowdown in economic activity, resulted in decreased revenues, increased costs and lower earnings per share during 2020. In addition, 
such a crisis could significantly increase the probability or consequences of the risks our business faces in ordinary circumstances, such as 
risks associated with our supplier and vendor relationships, risks of an economic slowdown, regulatory risks, and the costs and availability of 
financing. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly 
changing, the impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in 2022 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to 
predict. In addition, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations depends on 
many factors, including those discussed above, that are not within our control. 
We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. 
We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, 
switch and network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to 
our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical 
components, such as chipsets, used in their devices, and there are a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network 
infrastructure equipment on which we depend. These suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis, or fail 
to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including, for example, disruption to the global supply chain as a result of 
geopolitical factors, the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters or the potential impacts of global climate change. If such failures occur, we 
may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to maintain or 
upgrade our networks. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business 
could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with 
products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase 
our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including 
litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict 
whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and 
introduce more advanced generations of technology. 
A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience 
work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts.1 
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 24.0% of our workforce is represented by the Communications Workers of America or the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we 
could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while a 
small percentage of the workforce outside of our traditional wireline operations is represented by unions for bargaining, we cannot predict 
what impact increased union density in this workforce could have on our operations. 
Economic and Strategic Risks 
We face significant competition that may reduce our profits. 
We face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of 
the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors 
to our markets, including other telecommunications companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, technology 
companies and application and device providers. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have 
also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could 
experience lower than expected revenues and earnings. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial 
relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service 
provided – in some cases specifically targeting our customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our 
network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new 
and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels, our ability to market our products and 
services effectively and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting 
our industries, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, 
demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience 
reduced profits.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
If we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely 
basis, or if the deployment of our 5G network is delayed or hindered for any reason, we may experience a decline in the 
demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. 
Our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications 
needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in 
technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet 
future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We 
may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. If our new services fail to gain 
acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability 
to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. 
In addition, the deployment of our 5G network is subject to a variety of risks, including those related to equipment and spectrum availability, 
unexpected costs, and regulatory matters that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues. These issues could result in 
significant costs, put us at a competitive disadvantage, or reduce the anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our networks. 
As we introduce new offerings and technologies, such as 5G technology, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and 
services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or 
regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. 
Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations. 
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, or inflation in the markets in which 
we operate, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and our cost of doing business. In 
difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use 
fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. 
Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service 
offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and 
business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of 
operations. 
Regulatory and Legal Risks 
Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results 
of operations. 
Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, and our international operations are 
regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our 
ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our 
operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental 
proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending 
federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without 
relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we 
cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing 
licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material 
limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state, and local, or international level, such as those 
described below, those that incentivize business models or technologies different from ours or requirements limiting our ability to discontinue 
service to customers could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our businesses, impose 
additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us 
and our customers. 
• Privacy and data protection - We are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. Europe's 
General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went 
into effect in January 2020, both include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, other states and countries have 
continued to adopt new privacy laws that apply to us. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at 
all levels of government globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. 
These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. 
• Regulation of broadband internet access services - In its 2015 Title II Order, the FCC nullified its longstanding "light touch" 
approach to regulating broadband internet access services and "reclassified" these services as telecommunications services subject 
to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The FCC repealed the 2015 Title II Order in December 2017, and returned to its 
traditional light-touch approach for these services. The 2017 order has been affirmed in part by the D.C. Circuit but may be 
revisited by the FCC or by Congress. Several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that
16
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our services (in some cases different from the FCC’s 2015 rules). 
Although some of these have been challenged in court, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. 
• "Open Access" - We hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulations, which 
generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, 
certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could 
significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. 
• Climate-Related Regulation and Policy – Due to the nature of our operations, we may be impacted by regulatory developments 
related to climate change, including, for example, the direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could 
result in a tax on such emissions. In addition, policy-driven changes in the prices of fuel or energy in geographies in which we 
operate could make it more expensive for us to purchase energy to power our networks and data centers, and any increase in taxes 
on fuel could increase our costs associated with operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels. 
These developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions could result in 
significant increases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past 
and future investments in our networks. 
We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. 
We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, 
antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, 
billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged 
health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, 
we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. 
Financial Risks 
Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not 
retire existing debt. 
As of December 31, 2021, Verizon had approximately $136.7 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, $9.4 billion of unused borrowing 
capacity under our existing revolving credit facility and $14.2 billion of outstanding secured indebtedness. Verizon’s debt level and related 
debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: 
• requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable 
on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, 
dividend payments and acquisitions; 
• making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, 
debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; 
• reducing Verizon’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market conditions; 
• making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and 
• exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates. 
Adverse changes in the credit markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of 
financing. 
We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the 
public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of 
borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our 
ability to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets 
eligible to be securitized. Our borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating 
agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would 
likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial 
markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to 
financing. 
Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and 
increase our funding commitments. 
With approximately 118,400 employees, including approximately 800 Tracfone employees, and approximately 187,000 retirees as of 
December 31, 2021 eligible to participate in Verizon’s benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits 
17
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are 
affected by several factors, including increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other 
benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If 
we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding 
commitments. 
Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments   
None. 
Item 2.  Properties   
Our principal properties do not lend themselves to simple description by character and location. Our total gross investment in property, plant 
and equipment was approximately $290 billion at December 31, 2021 and $280 billion at December 31, 2020, including the effect of 
retirements, but before deducting accumulated depreciation. Our gross investment in property, plant and equipment consisted of the 
following: 
At December 31, 2021 2020 
Network equipment 76.9% 77.6% 
Land, buildings and building equipment 11.7% 12.0% 
Furniture and other  
   
  
  
  11.4% 10.4% 
100.0% 100.0% 
Network equipment consists primarily of cable (aerial, buried, underground or undersea) and the related support structures of poles and 
conduit, wireless plant, switching equipment, network software, transmission equipment and related facilities. Land, buildings and building 
equipment consists of land and land improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that house network equipment, and 
buildings that are used for administrative and other purposes. Substantially all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we 
own due to their critical role in the networks and high set-up and relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the U.S. comprised 
of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, garage work centers, switching centers, cell sites and data 
centers. Furniture and other consists of telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office equipment, motor vehicles, 
construction in process, and leasehold improvements. 
Item 3.    Legal Proceedings 
Verizon is not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding arising under any Federal, State or local provisions that have been enacted 
or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment that is likely 
to result in monetary sanctions of $1 million or more. 
Item 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures 
None.

PART II 
  Item 5.  Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
The principal market for trading in the common stock of Verizon is the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "VZ". As of 
December 31, 2021, there were 484,764 shareholders of record. 
Stock Repurchases 
In February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Verizon's 
common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase 
plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated 
transactions, on the open market, or otherwise, including through plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The timing and 
number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Company's capital allocation priorities. 
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’s common stock under our current or 
previously authorized share buyback programs. At December 31, 2021, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on 
behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.

  Item 6. [Reserved] 
Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
Overview 
Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s 
leading providers of communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and 
government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms 
that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. 
19
To compete effectively in today’s dynamic marketplace, we are focused on the capabilities of our high-performing networks to drive growth 
based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. During 2021, we focused on leveraging our network leadership; 
retaining and growing our high-quality customer base while balancing profitability; enhancing ecosystems in growth businesses; and driving 
monetization of our networks, platforms and solutions. We are creating business value by earning customers', employees' and shareholders' 
trust, limiting our environmental impact and continuing our customer base growth while creating social benefit through our products and 
services. Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide 
additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop 
and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities. We believe that steady and consistent 
investments in our networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth. 
We are consistently deploying new network architecture and technologies to secure our leadership in both fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-
generation (5G) wireless networks. We expect that our next-generation multi-use platform, which we call the Intelligent Edge Network, will 
simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in 
the business market in a cost efficient manner. Our network leadership is the hallmark of our brand and the foundation for the connectivity, 
platforms and solutions upon which we build our competitive advantage.

Verizon Consumer Group 
Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are 
provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and 
other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are 
provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through 
our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer 
segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network 
access from us on a wholesale basis. 
Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a 
monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and 
enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. The Consumer segment also 
offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet 
devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches. On November 23, 2021, we completed the 
acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), a provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. Additional information is 
included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries. 
In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Consumer sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, 
video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis. The Consumer segment's operating revenues for the 
year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $95.3 billion, an increase of $6.8 billion, or 7.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. See 
"Segment Results of Operations" for additional information regarding our Consumer segment’s operating performance and selected operating 
statistics. 
Verizon Business Group 
Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, 
corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver 
various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products, including solutions that support fleet tracking management, compliance management, 
field service management, asset tracking and other types of mobile resource management. We also provide FWA broadband through our 
wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the 
U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. The Business segment's operating revenues for the year ended 
December 31, 2021 totaled $31.0 billion, an increase of $80 million, or 0.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. See "Segment 
Results of Operations" for additional information regarding our Business segment’s operating performance and selected operating statistics. 
Corporate and Other 
Corporate and other primarily includes insurance captives, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that 
support our strategic initiatives, as well as unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee benefit related costs and 
interest and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses including Verizon Media Group 
(Verizon Media), and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their nature. 
Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and 
losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief 
operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance. 
On May 2, 2021, Verizon entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Apollo Global Management Inc. (the Apollo Affiliate) 
pursuant to which we agreed to sell Verizon Media to the affiliate. The transaction closed on September 1, 2021. See Note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements for additional information. Under our ownership, Verizon Media's total operating revenues were $5.3 billion 
for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Capital Expenditures and Investments 
We continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth 
trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2021, these investments included $20.3 billion for capital expenditures, inclusive of 
approximately $2.1 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See "Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities" and "Liquidity and Capital 
Resources" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide 
our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy. 
Global Network and Technology 
We are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also building our 
next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna 
systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT 
products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless 
technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. We expect that 5G technology will provide 
higher throughput and lower latency than the current 4G LTE technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of 
internet-connected devices grows. As of December 31, 2021, 5G Ultra Wideband is available in parts of 87 U.S. cities and 5G Home is 
available in parts of 65 U.S. cities. 5G Nationwide uses low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, which 
allows 5G service to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s 
high-band Ultra Wideband coverage area, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum bands where the 
5G Nationwide network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4G and 
5G customers. 
To compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks supporting data, 
video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We are transforming the 
architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and virtualization, increased automation and 
opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. We expect that this new 
architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new 
opportunities in the business market in a cost-efficient manner. 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 
The impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations were significant during 2020, which affects the comparability of the results 
from 2021 to 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain, including the 
recent surge of new virus variants across the U.S. We remain committed to caring for the health and safety of our employees and our 
customers through this challenge while supporting the communities in which we operate. While we have not experienced a material impact on 
our business from these new variants thus far, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impact they may have on our results of operations 
in the future, and will continue to monitor their daily evolution. For a discussion of the risks to our business from COVID-19, refer to Item 1A 
Risk Factors. 
Recent Development 
In January 2022, we successfully deployed C-Band spectrum, reaching approximately 100 million people in the U.S. as of February 2022. 
Consolidated Results of Operations 
In this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment results. In

outsourcing contracts and technical facilities and traffic acquisition costs. Aggregate customer service costs, which include billing and service 
provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense. 
Cost of services decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• a decrease of $576 million in traffic acquisition primarily related to the sale of Verizon Media; 
• a decrease of $294 million in personnel costs primarily related to the sale of Verizon Media; 
• a decrease of $220 million in access costs primarily related to a decline in voice services offset by the inclusion of Tracfone results 
since the acquisition date; 
• an increase of $349 million in rent expense related to both adding capacity to the networks to support demand and lease 
modifications for certain existing cell towers to support the build out of our 5G wireless network; 
• an increase of $205 million related to the device protection offerings to our wireless retail postpaid customers; 
• an increase of $185 million in buildings and facilities costs primarily driven by higher utility rates; and 
• an increase of $164 million in regulatory fees related to a higher Federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF) rate. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media.  
Cost of Wireless Equipment 
Cost of wireless equipment increased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• an increase of $3.6 billion related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold, partly driven by the 
increased demand for 5G enabled devices; and 
• an increase of $1.3 billion driven by a higher volume of wireless devices and accessories sold. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
Selling, general and administrative expense includes salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product, the 
provision for credit losses, taxes other than income taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, call center and information technology 
23
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
costs, regulatory fees, professional service fees and rent and utilities for administrative space. Also included is a portion of the aggregate 
customer care costs as discussed above in "Cost of Services." 
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• the $651 million net gain related to the sale of Verizon Media in 2021, compared to the $126 million loss related to the sale of 
Huffington Post in 2020. In 2021, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $1.0 billion and $346 million of various 
costs associated with the sale of Verizon Media; 
• the $1.2 billion loss during 2020 resulting from the exchange of spectrum licenses in connection with Auction 103, compared to the 
$223 million loss recognized during 2021 resulting from agreements we entered into to sell certain wireless licenses; 
• a decrease of $857 million in personnel expense primarily related to the sale of Verizon Media in 2021 and additional sales 
commission expense resulting from actions taken in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 
• a decrease of $591 million in provision for credit losses related to both improvement in payment trends in 2021 as well as actions 
taken in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
• an increase of $364 million in advertising and promotion costs related to brand messaging in 2021 as well as lower expenses in 
2020 related to customer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on both the sale of Verizon Media and loss on spectrum 
licenses. 
Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2021 compared to 2020, primarily as a result of the Verizon Media sale. See Note 3 
to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

non-operating asset dispositions, debt extinguishment costs, components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost and income 
and foreign exchange gains and losses. 
Other income (expense), net changed during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• a net pension and postretirement benefits remeasurement gain of $2.4 billion recorded during 2021, compared with a net pension 
and postretirement benefits remeasurement loss of $1.6 billion recorded during 2020; and 
• an increase of $3.4 billion in early debt redemption costs driven by tender offers, the redemptions of securities issued by Verizon 
and open market repurchases of Verizon and subsidiary notes in 2021.

Effective interest rate (2) (3) 3.6 %  4.1 % 
nm - not meaningful 
(1) The average debt outstanding is a financial measure and is calculated by applying a simple average of prior thirteen-month end balances of 
total short-term and long-term debt, net of discounts, premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs. 
(2) The effective interest rate is the rate of actual interest incurred on debt. It is calculated by dividing the total interest costs on debt balances 
by the average debt outstanding. 
(3) We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our debt 
financing cost and trends in our debt leverage management. 
Total interest expense decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• an increase in capitalized interest costs as a result of qualifying activities performed on C-Band licenses won; and 
• an increase in interest costs on debt balances as a result of higher average debt balances, partially offset by lower average interest 
rates as a result of our continuing focus on optimizing our debt footprint and total borrowing costs. 
See Note 4 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on spectrum licenses and debt transactions, 
respectively. 
Provision for Income Taxes 
(dollars in millions) 
Increase/(Decrease) 
Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 
Provision for income taxes $ 6,802 $ 5,619 $ 1,183  21.1 % 
Effective income tax rate  23.1 %  23.4 % 
The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The 
decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media in the current period, partially offset by the non-
recurring tax benefit recognized in 2020 from a series of legal entity restructurings. The increase in the provision for income taxes was 
primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes in the current period. 
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 
Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted 
EBITDA, which are presented below, are non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures that we believe are useful to 
management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they 
exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as 
well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon’s competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses to net income. 
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: 
equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, as well as the effect of special items. We 
believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our 
operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. We believe 
that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by 
minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of 
non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. See "Special Items" for 
additional information. 
It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’s GAAP financial 
information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with 
GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis 
25
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows 
management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment 
performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be 
directly comparable to that of other companies.

The changes in Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the table above during 2021 
compared to 2020, were primarily a result of the factors described in connection with operating revenues and operating expenses. 
Segment Results of Operations 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. We measure and evaluate 
our segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief operating decision 
maker’s assessment of segment performance. 
To aid in the understanding of segment performance as it relates to segment operating income, management uses the following operating 
statistics to evaluate the overall effectiveness of our segments. We believe these operating statistics are useful to investors and other users of 
our financial information because they provide additional insight into drivers of our segments’ operating results, key trends and performance 
relative to our peers. These operating statistics may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly 
comparable to those statistics of other companies. 
Wireless retail connections are retail customer device postpaid and prepaid connections as of the end of the period. Retail connections under 
an account may include those from smartphones and basic phones (collectively, phones), as well as tablets and other internet devices, 
including wearables and retail IoT devices. Wireless retail connections are calculated by adding total retail postpaid and prepaid new 
connections in the period to prior period retail connections, and subtracting total retail postpaid and prepaid disconnects in the period. 
Wireless retail postpaid connections are retail postpaid customer device connections as of the end of the period. Retail connections under an 
account may include those from phones, as well as tablets and other internet devices, including wearables and retail IoT devices. Wireless 
retail postpaid connections are calculated by adding retail postpaid new connections in the period to prior period retail postpaid connections, 
and subtracting retail postpaid disconnects in the period. 
Fios internet connections are the total number of connections to the internet using Fios internet services as of the end of the period. Fios 
internet connections are calculated by adding Fios internet new connections in the period to prior period Fios internet connections, and 
subtracting Fios internet disconnects in the period. 
Fios video connections are the total number of connections to traditional linear video programming using Fios video services as of the end of 
the period. Fios video connections are calculated by adding Fios video net additions in the period to prior period Fios video connections. Fios 
video net additions are calculated by subtracting the Fios video disconnects from the Fios video new connections. 
Wireline broadband connections are the total number of connections to the internet using Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Fios internet 
services as of the end of the period. Wireline broadband connections are calculated by adding wireline broadband net additions in the period 
to prior period wireline broadband connections. Wireline broadband net additions are calculated by subtracting the wireline broadband 
disconnects from the wireline broadband new connections.
26
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Wireless retail connections, net additions are the total number of additional retail customer device postpaid and prepaid connections, less the 
number of device disconnects in the period. Wireless retail connections, net additions in each period presented are calculated by subtracting 
the total retail postpaid and prepaid disconnects, net of certain adjustments, from the total retail postpaid and prepaid new connections in the 
period. 
Wireless retail postpaid connections, net additions are the total number of additional retail customer device postpaid connections, less the 
number of device disconnects in the period. Wireless retail postpaid connections, net additions in each period presented are calculated by 
subtracting the retail postpaid disconnects, net of certain adjustments, from the retail postpaid new connections in the period. 
Wireless retail postpaid phone connections, net additions are the total number of additional retail customer postpaid phone connections, less 
the number of phone disconnects in the period. Wireless retail postpaid phone connections, net additions in each period presented are 
calculated by subtracting the retail postpaid phone disconnects, net of certain adjustments, from the retail postpaid phone new connections in 
the period. 
Wireless Churn is the rate at which service to retail, retail postpaid, or retail postpaid phone connections is terminated on average in the 
period. The churn rate in each period presented is calculated by dividing retail disconnections, retail postpaid disconnections, or retail 
postpaid phone disconnections by the average retail connections, average retail postpaid connections, or average retail postpaid phone 
connections, respectively, in the period. 
Wireless retail postpaid ARPA is the calculated average retail postpaid service revenue per account (ARPA) from retail postpaid accounts in 
the period. Wireless retail postpaid service revenue does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device 
payment program, plan billings related to device warranty and insurance or regulatory fees. Wireless retail postpaid ARPA in each period 
presented is calculated by dividing retail postpaid service revenue by the average retail postpaid accounts in the period.    
Wireless retail postpaid accounts are wireless retail customers that are directly served and managed under the Verizon brand and use its 
services as of the end of the period. Accounts include unlimited plans, shared data plans and corporate accounts, as well as legacy single 
connection plans and multi-connection family plans. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected 
devices. Wireless retail postpaid accounts are calculated by adding retail postpaid new accounts to the prior period retail postpaid accounts.  
Wireless retail postpaid connections per account is the calculated average number of retail postpaid connections per retail postpaid account as 
of the end of the period. Wireless retail postpaid connections per account is calculated by dividing the total number of retail postpaid 
connections by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. 
Segment operating income margin reflects the profitability of the segment as a percentage of revenue. Segment operating income margin is 
calculated by dividing total segment operating income by total segment operating revenues. 
Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA), which is presented below, is a non-GAAP 
measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure 
is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost 
basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior 
years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back 
depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income (loss). Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Segment 
EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Consumer's total operating revenues increased during 2021 compared to 2020, as a result of increases in Service and Wireless equipment 
revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Other revenue. The increase in Consumer total operating revenues includes the net impact of 
approximately $680 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 as a result of our acquisition of Tracfone. 
Service Revenue 
Service revenue increased during 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by increases in wireless and Fios service revenues. 
Wireless service revenue increased $2.5 billion during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• an increase of $1.3 billion in access revenues related to our postpaid plans driven by additional subscribers and migrations to higher 
priced plans as well as growth related to content offerings, cloud services and mobile security products included in certain 
protection packages; 
• an increase of $544 million, representing the net impact as a result of the acquisition of Tracfone in the fourth quarter of 2021; and 
• an increase of $464 million related to growth in non-retail service revenue. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Fios service revenue totaled $10.8 billion, representing an increase of $462 million compared to 2020 
primarily resulting from an increase in Fios internet connections, reflecting increased demand for higher broadband speeds, partially offset by 
a decrease in Fios voice revenues. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition of Tracfone. 
Wireless Equipment Revenue 
Wireless equipment revenue increased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• an increase of $2.6 billion related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold, partly driven by the 
increased demand for 5G enabled devices; and
28
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
• an increase of $1.6 billion driven by a higher volume of wireless devices and accessories sold, partially offset by related 
promotions. 
Other Revenue 
Other revenue includes non-service revenues such as regulatory fees, cost recovery surcharges, revenues associated with certain products 
included in our device protection offerings, leasing and interest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to 
the customer by an authorized agent. 
Other revenue decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• a decrease of $462 million that resulted from an update to our device protection offering which increased the price of the bundled 
offering and changed the product mix within the offering such that a smaller amount of the overall device protection revenue is 
recognized in Other revenue; and 
• an increase of $128 million related to cost recovery surcharges.

Cost of Services 
Cost of services increased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• an increase in rent expense of $323 million related to adding capacity to the networks to support demand and lease modifications for 
certain existing cell towers to support the build out of our 5G wireless network; 
• an increase in digital content costs of $209 million driven by additional streaming service subscriptions, partially offset by a decline 
in traditional linear content costs; 
• an increase of $197 million related to the device protection offerings to our wireless retail postpaid customers; and 
• an increase of $133 million in network access costs primarily driven by the inclusion of Tracfone results since acquisition date. 
Cost of Wireless Equipment 
Cost of wireless equipment increased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• an increase of $2.3 billion driven by a higher volume of wireless devices and accessories sold; and 
• an increase of $2.2 billion related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold, partly driven by the 
increased demand for 5G enabled devices. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• a decrease in provision for credit losses of $564 million related to both improvement in payment trends in 2021 as well as actions 
taken in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 
• a decrease in personnel expense of $237 million primarily driven by additional sales commission expense related to actions taken in 
2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 
• an increase in advertising expenses of $390 million related to brand messaging in 2021 as well as lower expenses in 2020 related to 
customer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
• an increase in building and facilities of $121 million primarily driven by higher utility rates. 
Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2021 compared to 2020, driven by the change in the mix of total Verizon depreciable 
assets and Consumer's usage of those assets.

Small and Medium Business offers wireless services and equipment, conferencing services, tailored voice and networking products, Fios 
services, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, advanced voice solutions and security and managed information technology services to our U.S.-
based small and medium businesses that do not meet the requirements to be categorized as Global Enterprise, as described below.
30
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
Small and Medium Business revenues increased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• an increase in wireless equipment revenue of $392 million driven by a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of devices sold 
and higher volumes, partially offset by an increase in promotions; 
• an increase in wireless service revenue of $331 million driven by an increase in the amount of wireless retail postpaid connections, 
as well as increases in usage and non-recurring fees related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year; and 
• a decrease of $127 million related to the loss of voice and DSL service connections. 
Fios revenues totaled $984 million, which represents an increase of $58 million during 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily 
related to increases in total connections, as well as increased demand for higher broadband speeds. 
Global Enterprise 
Global Enterprise offers services to large businesses, which are identified based on their size and volume of business with Verizon, as well as 
non-U.S. public sector customers. 
Global Enterprise revenues decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• a decrease of $467 million in traditional data and voice communication services related to secular pressures in the marketplace; 
• an increase of $106 million in wireless equipment revenue driven by a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of devices sold 
and higher volumes; 
• an increase of $90 million in customer premise equipment related to increased volumes; and 
• an increase of $58 million related to professional services revenue. 
Public Sector and Other 
Public Sector and Other offers wireless products and services as well as wireline connectivity and managed solutions to U.S. federal, state and 
local governments and educational institutions. These services include business services and connectivity similar to the products and services 
offered by Global Enterprise, in each case, with features and pricing designed to address the needs of governments and educational 
institutions. 
Public Sector and Other revenues decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• a decrease of $248 million due to customers migrating to new solutions, customer premise equipment volumes and other 
miscellaneous activity; 
• a decrease of $42 million in wireless equipment revenue primarily driven by a decrease in the number of wireless devices sold as a 
result of a reduction in activations partly related to COVID-19 impacts in the prior year. The decrease is partially offset by a shift to 
higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold; 
• an increase in wireless service revenue of $217 million primarily related to a higher volume of wireless connections driven by 
shifting technology needs in remote business environments, particularly in education; and 
• an increase of $52 million in professional services revenue. 
Wholesale 
Wholesale offers wireline communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long 
distance, and wireless carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. 
Wholesale revenues decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to: 
• a decrease of $338 million related to declines in traditional voice communication and network connectivity as a result of technology 
substitution.

Severance, Pension and Benefits Charges (Credits) 
During 2021, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur, we recorded 
net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.4 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The credits were recorded in Other 
income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a credit of $1.1 billion due to an increase in our 
discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-
average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020 to a weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021, a credit of $847 million due to the difference 
between our estimated and our actual return on assets and a credit of $453 million due to other actuarial assumption adjustments. During 
2021, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $209 million related to voluntary separations under our existing plans in Selling, 
general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. 
During 2020, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur, we recorded 
net pre-tax pension and benefits charges of $1.6 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The charges were recorded in Other 
income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income and were primarily driven by a charge of $3.2 billion due to a decrease in our 
discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-
average of 3.3% at December 31, 2019 to a weighted-average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020, partially offset by a credit of $1.6 billion due to 
the difference between our estimated and our actual return on assets. During 2020, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $221 
million related to a voluntary offer under our existing separation plans in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated 
statements of income. 
Due to the presentation of the other components of net periodic benefit cost, we recognize a portion of the pension and benefits charges 
(credits) in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. 
See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to severance, pension and benefits charges (credits). 
Loss on Spectrum Licenses 
During 2021, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $223 million as a result of signing two agreements to sell certain wireless licenses. 
During 2020, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $1.2 billion as a result of the conclusion of the FCC incentive auction, Auction 103, for 
spectrum licenses in the upper 37 Gigahertz (GHz), 39 GHz and 47 GHz bands. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for 
additional information. 
Net Early Debt Redemption Costs 
During 2021, we recorded pre-tax early debt redemption costs of $3.5 billion in connection with tender offers, the redemptions of securities 
issued by Verizon and open market repurchases of various Verizon and subsidiary notes. 
During 2020, we recorded net pre-tax early debt redemption costs of $102 million in connection with the redemptions of securities issued by 
Verizon and open market repurchases. 
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our early debt redemptions. 
Net (Gain) Loss from Dispositions of Assets and Businesses 
During 2021, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $837 million, primarily in connection with the sales of Verizon Media and our investment in 
the Complex Media business. During 2020, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $119 million, primarily in connection with the sale of our 
Huffington Post business. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to dispositions of assets and businesses. 
Operating Environment and Trends 
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional 
participants seek increased market share. Our high-quality customer base and networks differentiate us from our competitors and give us the 
ability to plan and manage through changing economic and competitive conditions. We remain focused on executing on the fundamentals of 
the business: maintaining a high-quality customer base, delivering strong financial and operating results and strengthening our balance sheet. 
33
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
We will continue to invest for growth, which we believe is the key to creating value for our shareholders. We continue to lead in 4G LTE 
performance while building momentum for our 5G network. Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our 
Intelligent Edge Network that enable efficiencies throughout our core infrastructure and deliver flexibility to meet customer requirements. 
The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth 
for the industry. We expect future revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer relationships, increasing the 
number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and services and increasing the penetration of other connected devices 
including wearables, tablets and IoT devices. We expect 5G technology will provide a significant opportunity for growth in the industry in 
2022 and beyond. With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service 
providers, including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail 
activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. 
Resellers include cable companies and others. We face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to 
increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to 
non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are 
offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s 
voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. 
With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. We compete in this 
area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price. As the demand 
for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices. These service 
offerings will vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard 
plans or as part of limited time promotional offers. 
We expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customers shift to higher access plans, 
driven in part by attractive bundled content with premium brands, as well as from increased connections per account. Future service revenue 
growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services, increasing the number of ways that our customers can 
connect with our networks and services and the development of new ecosystems. We and other wireless service providers, as well as 
equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of 
time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. 
Current and potential competitors in the wireline service market include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign 
telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service providers, over-the-top providers and other companies that offer 
network services and managed enterprise solutions. 
In addition, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our wireline services. A relatively small number of 
telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser 
extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises 
and government customers. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all 
of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. 
Despite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our wireline services. We continue to provide 
network reliability and offer products, which include fiber-optic internet access, several video services, and voice services. Further, we will 
continue to offer our business and government customers more robust IP products and services, and advance our IoT strategies by leveraging 
business models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. 
We will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to ensure we have the maximum flexibility to adjust to changes in the competitive and 
economic environments and maximize returns to shareholders. 
2022 Connection Trends 
In our Consumer segment, we expect to continue to attract new customers and maintain high-quality retail postpaid customers, capitalizing on 
demand for data services and providing our customers new ways of using wireless services in their daily lives. We expect that future 
connection growth will be driven by smartphones, tablets and other connected devices such as wearables. We believe the combination of our 
wireless network performance and Mix & Match unlimited plans provides a superior customer experience, supporting increased penetration 
of data services and the continued attraction and retention of higher valued retail postpaid connections. We anticipate continued pressure in 
2022 related to Tracfone subscribers as we seek to improve the customer retention rate that has declined over the prior two years, however 
expect to grow the Tracfone customer base over time by furthering our investment and increasing our product and service offerings within the 
business. We expect to manage churn by providing a consistent, reliable experience on our wireless service and focusing on improving the 
customer experience through simplified pricing and continued focus in our distribution channels. We expect to continue to grow our Fios 
internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas, further supported by the demand for higher 
speed internet connections. At the same time, we expect accelerating fixed wireless access connections to complement strong Fios results as 
demand for services continues to grow. In Fios video, the business continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear 
television market. We expect to manage market pressure by offering customers a choice of video service, including options such as Mix & 
Match on Fios and other offerings. We have experienced continuing access line and DSL losses as customers have disconnected both primary 
34
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and secondary lines and switched to alternative technologies such as wireless, Voice over Internet Protocol, and cable for voice and data 
services. 
In our Business segment, we offer wireless products and services to business and government customers across the U.S. We continue to grow 
our retail connections while operating in a competitive environment. We expect that this connection growth, combined with our industry-
leading network assets, will provide additional opportunities to sell solutions, such as those around security, advanced communications and 
professional services. We also expect to expand our existing services offered to business customers through our Intelligent Edge Network, our 
multi-use platform. 
In addition, in both our Consumer and our Business segments, we expect to support connection growth in part by adding capacity and density 
to our 4G LTE network, and by leading the build-out of our 5G network. We also anticipate the continued migration of 3G connections onto 
4G and 5G technologies with the expected cessation of 3G services. 
2022 Operating Revenue Trends 
In our Consumer segment, we expect to see a continuation of service revenue growth in 2022 as customers shift to higher access plans with 
additional services and increase the number of devices they connect with our networks and services. We expect continued growth in wireless 
service revenue, driven by Tracfone contributions, migrations to higher priced plans and increases in fixed wireless access connections. We 
expect Fios revenue to benefit in 2022 as growth in our broadband customer base and increases in demand for higher speed internet 
connections offsets the impact of the shift from the triple-play bundle to standalone service. 
In our Business segment, we expect wireless revenue to expand, driven by growth from increases in wireless volumes and fixed wireless 
access contributions. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth. Legacy traditional wireline 
services will continue to face secular pressures. 
On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. We expect to see a decrease in operating revenues as a result of this 
divestiture. 
2022 Operating Expense and Cash Flow from Operations Trends 
We expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin to remain strong as we continue to drive 
revenue growth and undertake initiatives to reduce our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our 
operations throughout the business in 2022 and beyond. Business Excellence initiatives include zero-based budgeting methodology, driving 
capital efficiencies from the architecture of the networks and evolving our Information Technology strategy. We believe our additional 
investments in our Business segment in both product simplification and continued focus on process improvements and new work tools will 
drive cost savings and create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5G and One Fiber. 
We create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support 
continued profitable growth, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In addition, we have used our 
cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to shareholders. Verizon’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly 
dividend by 2.0% during 2021, making this the fifteenth consecutive year in which we have raised our dividend. 
Our goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help 
us to grow the business, strengthen our balance sheet, acquire spectrum licenses (see "Cash Flows from Investing Activities"), pay dividends 
to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock (see "Cash Flows from Financing Activities"). 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
We use the net cash generated from our operations to fund expansion and modernization of our networks, service and repay external 
financing, pay dividends, invest in new businesses and spectrum and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. 
Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet 
ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. 
Our cash and cash equivalents balance is $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2021, consistent with historical pre-pandemic levels. Our cash and 
cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally, and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity. See "Market 
Risk" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies. 
We expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity 
financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, such as the completion of business acquisitions, the 
acquisition of additional wireless spectrum, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility. Our available 
external financing arrangements include an active commercial paper program, credit available under credit facilities and other bank lines of 
credit, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other capital 
market securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize our device payment plan agreement receivables 
through asset-backed debt transactions.
35
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Capital Expenditures 
Our 2022 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding our core networks, adding capacity 
and density to our 5G network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and deploying C-Band, transforming our 
structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network while reducing the cost to deliver services to our customers, and pursuing other opportunities 
to drive operating efficiencies. We expect that the new network architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, 
improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology, and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market. We 
anticipate cash requirements for our 2022 capital program to be between $16.5 billion and $17.5 billion. Furthermore, we expect an additional 
$5.0 billion to $6.0 billion in capital expenditures related to C-Band, as we continue to build out the initial markets and begin preparations for 
deploying phase two spectrum. 
Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
We have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known 
contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021: 
• Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $150.2 billion and related interest payments of $78.0 billion, of 
which $7.1 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in long-term 
debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial 
statements. 
• Operating lease obligations of $31.5 billion and Finance lease obligations of $1.4 billion, of which $4.4 billion and $402 million, 
respectively, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. In addition, the Company has an obligation of $969 million 
representing future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement for our cell towers, of which $292 million is expected to be 
due within the next twelve months. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
• Unconditional purchase obligations, with terms in excess of one year, amount to $29.8 billion, of which $10.2 billion is expected to 
be due within the next twelve months. Items included in unconditional purchase obligations are primarily commitments to purchase 
network equipment, software and services, content, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary 
course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that 
are the subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. See Note 16 
to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
• Other long-term liabilities, including current maturities, of $4.2 billion, of which $864 million is expected to be due within the next 
twelve months. Other long-term liabilities represent estimated postretirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions. 
Qualified pension plan contributions include estimated minimum funding contributions. We expect that there will be no required 
pension funding through 2031, subject to changes in market conditions. Postretirement benefit payments include estimated future 
postretirement benefit payments. These estimated amounts: (1) are subject to change based on changes to assumptions and future 
plan performance, which could impact the timing and/or amounts of these payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years 
due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
• We are not able to make a reasonable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $3.1 billion and related interest and 
penalties will be settled with the respective taxing authorities until the related tax audits are further developed or resolved. See Note 
12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities 
Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 
$2.2 billion during 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to changes in working capital, which includes higher wireless volumes, and slightly 
higher cash taxes in 2021. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in earnings of $4.3 billion. As a result of prior years' 
discretionary contributions and the fact that actual asset returns have been higher than expected, we expect that there will be no required 
pension funding through 2031, subject to changes in market conditions. 
Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities 
Capital Expenditures 
Capital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to increase the operating efficiency and productivity of our 
networks, maintain our existing infrastructure, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and enhance responsiveness to 
competitive challenges.
36
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were $20.3 billion and $18.2 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Capital 
expenditures increased approximately $2.1 billion, or 11.5%, during 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased focus on 5G 
technology deployment. 
Acquisitions of Wireless Licenses 
In February 2021, the FCC completed an auction, Auction 107, for mid-band spectrum known as C-Band. During 2021, we paid 
approximately $45.9 billion for spectrum licenses in connection with this auction and related costs, of which $1.3 billion was primarily paid 
for certain obligations related to projected clearing costs associated with this auction. 
During 2020, we paid approximately $3.9 billion in acquisitions of wireless licenses. In March 2020, the FCC completed an incentive auction, 
Auction 103, for spectrum licenses. Through December 31, 2020, we paid approximately $1.6 billion, including $101 million paid in 
December 2019. In September 2020, the FCC completed Auction 105 for Priority Access Licenses. Through December 31, 2020, we paid 
approximately $1.9 billion for the licenses. 
During 2021 and 2020, we recorded capitalized interest related to wireless licenses of $1.6 billion and $242 million, respectively. 
During 2021 and 2020, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash consideration of $95 million and 
$360 million, respectively. 
Acquisitions of Businesses, Net of Cash Acquired 
During 2021 and 2020, we invested $4.1 billion and $520 million, respectively, in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired. 
In September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Tracfone, a provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. 
The transaction closed in November 2021. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the transaction was 
approximately $3.6 billion, net of cash acquired, subject to customary closing adjustments, approximately 57.6 million shares of Verizon 
common stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future cash contingent consideration. 
In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass Cellular (Bluegrass), a rural wireless operator 
serving central Kentucky. The transaction closed in March 2021. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the 
transaction was approximately $412 million, net of cash acquired, which is subject to customary closing adjustments. 
In April 2020, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Blue Jeans Network, Inc. (BlueJeans), an enterprise-grade video 
conferencing and event platform, whose services are sold to Business customers globally. The transaction closed in May 2020. The aggregate 
cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately $397 million, net of cash acquired. 
During 2021 and 2020, we completed various other acquisitions for cash consideration of approximately $51 million and $127 million, 
respectively. 
See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for information on our acquisitions. 
Disposition of Business 
During 2021, we received cash proceeds in connection with the sale of Verizon Media of $4.1 billion, net of cash transferred, subject to 
customary adjustments, $750 million in non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate and 10% of the fully-
diluted common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional 
information. 
Other, Net 
During 2021, we received cash of $321 million in connection with the settlement of a note receivable related to Tracfone and net cash 
proceeds of $98 million in connection with the sale of our investment in the Complex Media business. 
Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against 
earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. During 2021 and 2020, net cash provided by financing 
activities was $8.3 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. 
2021 
During 2021, our net cash provided by financing activities of $8.3 billion was primarily driven by $41.4 billion provided by proceeds from 
long-term borrowings, which included $8.4 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions. These cash flows provided by 
financing activities were partially offset by $18.9 billion used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings (secured 
and unsecured) as well as finance lease obligations, $10.4 billion used for dividend payments and $3.8 billion used for other financing 
activities. 
37
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings 
At December 31, 2021, our total debt increased to $150.9 billion as compared to $129.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Our effective interest  
rate was 3.6% and 4.1% during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio  
consists of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest rates do not have a material effect on our interest payments. See also "Market  
Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
At  December  31,  2021,  approximately  $33.5  billion,  or  22.2%,  of  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  our  total  debt  portfolio  consisted  of  
foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on our foreign denominated  
debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or  
losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information. 
Verizon may acquire debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates through open market purchases, redemptions, privately negotiated  
transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as Verizon may from time to time determine, for  
cash or other consideration. 
Other, Net 
Other,  net  financing  activities  during  2021  includes  $320  million  in  payments  related  to  vendor  financing  arrangements,  $161  million  in  
postings  of  derivative  collateral  and  early  debt  redemption  costs.  See  Note  15  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional  
information on the early debt redemption costs. 
Dividends 
The Verizon Board of Directors assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such factors as long-term  
growth  opportunities,  internal  cash  requirements  and  the  expectations  of  our  shareholders.  During  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  the  Board  
increased  our  quarterly  dividend  payment  by  2.0%  to  $0.6400  from  $0.6275  per  share  from  the  previous  quarter.  This  is  the  fifteenth  
consecutive year that Verizon's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend increase. 
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2021, we paid $10.4 billion in dividends. 
2020 
During 2020, our net cash provided by financing activities of $1.3 billion was primarily driven by $31.5 billion provided by proceeds from  
long-term  borrowings,  which  included  $5.6  billion  of  proceeds  from  our  asset-backed  debt  transactions.  These  cash  flows  provided  by  
financing activities were partially offset by $17.2 billion used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings (secured  
and  unsecured)  as  well  as  finance  lease  obligations,  $10.2  billion  used  for  dividend  payments  and  $2.7  billion  used  for  other  financing  
activities. 
  
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings 
At December 31, 2020, our total debt was $129.1 billion, and during the year ended December 31, 2020, our effective interest rate was 4.1%.  
The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest rates did not have a  
material effect on our interest payments. See "Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
At  December  31,  2020,  approximately  $29.0  billion,  or  22.5%,  of  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  our  total  debt  portfolio  consisted  of  
foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on substantially all of our  
foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency  
transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information. 
Other, Net 
Other, net financing activities during 2020 includes $827 million in payments related to vendor financing arrangements and $748 million in  
cash paid on debt exchanges. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Dividends 
During the third quarter of 2020, the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment by 2.0% to $0.6275 per share. 
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2020, we paid $10.2 billion in dividends. 
Asset-Backed Debt 
As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $14.2 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes Asset-Backed Notes  
(ABS Notes) issued to third-party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities  
(collectively, the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively, the ABS  
Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under  
the terms of our asset-backed debt, Cellco Partnership (Cellco), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon, and certain other affiliates of Verizon  
(collectively, the Originators) transfer device payment plan agreement receivables to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such 
38
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon entities retain the equity interests and residual interests, as applicable, in the 
ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related 
payments and expenses. 
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. 
The device payment plan agreement receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will 
only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers 
of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed debt transactions, and will not be available 
to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied. The 
Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any 
recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, Verizon has agreed to 
guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the ABS Entities. 
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain 
specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in 
Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash 
flows. The asset-backed debt issued and the assets securing this debt are included in our consolidated balance sheets. 
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
In December 2021, we entered into an ABS financing facility with a number of financial institutions (2021 ABS Financing Facility). Two 
loan agreements were entered into in connection with the 2021 ABS Financing Facility in December 2021. Under the terms of the 2021 ABS 
Financing Facility, the financial institutions make advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement receivables 
of both Consumer customers and Business customers. Two loan agreements are outstanding in connection with the 2021 ABS Financing 
Facility, one with a final maturity date in December 2025 and the other in December 2026, and each loan agreement bears interest at floating 
rates. There is a one or two year revolving period, as set forth in the applicable loan agreement, which may be extended with the approval of 
the financial institutions. Under the loan agreements, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time without penalty, 
but in certain cases, with breakage costs. Subject to certain conditions, we may also remove receivables from the ABS Entity. In December 
2021, we borrowed $4.3 billion under the loan agreements. The aggregate outstanding balance under the 2021 ABS Financing Facility was 
$4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. 
Long-Term Credit Facilities

Total $ 16,500 $ 9,418 $ 4,676 
N/A - not applicable 
(1) The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to 
borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of 
credit. 
(2) During both 2021 and 2020, we drew down $1.0 billion from these facilities, respectively. These credit facilities are used to finance 
equipment-related purchases. Borrowings under certain of these facilities amortize semi-annually in equal installments up to the applicable 
maturity dates. Maturities reflect maturity dates of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and 
subsequently repaid cannot be reborrowed. 
In November 2021, we repaid $500 million under an export credit facility entered into in July 2017. 
Common Stock 
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the 
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we issued 2.1 million and 2.3 million common shares from treasury stock, respectively, which had 
an insignificant aggregate value. 
In connection with our acquisition of Tracfone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6 million shares of Verizon common shares 
from treasury stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
In February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Verizon's 
common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase 
plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the 
39
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. There were no repurchases of common stock during 
2021 and 2020 under our current or previously authorized share buyback program. 
Credit Ratings 
Verizon’s credit ratings did not change in 2021 or 2020. 
Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A 
securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated 
independently of any other rating. 
Covenants 
Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay 
interest and principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies, preserve our 
corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain our properties, provide financial and other reports 
to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and consolidations, and other similar covenants. 
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements. 
Change In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 totaled $2.9 billion, a $19.3 billion decrease compared to December 31, 2020, primarily 
as a result of the factors discussed above. 
Restricted cash at December 31, 2021 totaled $1.2 billion, an $87 million decrease compared to restricted cash at December 31, 2020, 
primarily related to cash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed 
into segregated accounts. 
Free Cash Flow 
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, we believe, when viewed with 
our GAAP results, provides management, investors and other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of 
factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) 
from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets are 
necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for 
discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments 
for business acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire 
consolidated statements of cash flows. 
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: 
(dollars in millions) 
Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 39,539 $ 41,768 
Less Capital expenditures (including capitalized software) 20,286 18,192 
Free cash flow $ 19,253 $ 23,576 
The decrease in free cash flow during 2021 is a reflection of the decrease in operating cash flows, as well as the increase in capital 
expenditures discussed above. 
Employee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions 
Employer Contributions 
We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our 
domestic business units. We made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in either 2021 or 2020. During 2021 and 2020 
we made contributions of $58 million and $57 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively. 
The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into 
consideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a 
liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets with the interest rate 
sensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase 
(referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries; however, 
we also expect the strategy to result in lower asset returns. Nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately $60 million 
in 2022.
40
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since these other 
postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $885 million and $709 million to 
our other postretirement benefit plans in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to 
be approximately $860 million in 2022. 
Leasing Arrangements 
See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to leasing arrangements. 
Guarantees 
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for 
additional information. 
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and 
warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial 
losses. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
As of December 31, 2021, letters of credit totaling approximately $674 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and 
support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial 
statements for additional information. 
Other Future Obligations 
During 2021, Verizon entered into seven renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 13 signed in 
previous years. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Under the REPAs, we plan to purchase up to 
an aggregate of approximately 2.6 gigawatts of capacity across multiple states, including Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, New 
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia. 
Critical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
Critical Accounting Estimates 
A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements are as follows: 
Wireless Licenses and Goodwill 
Wireless licenses and Goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as 
indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, 
unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim period suggesting impairment indicators 
are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation 
date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in 
our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is 
possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, 
margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which 
could result in different fair value estimates. Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and 
assumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units. 
Wireless Licenses 
The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $147.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. We aggregate our wireless licenses 
into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our 
wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. 
There are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. 
We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to 
first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect 
to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to 
perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative 
impairment assessment according to the policy. 
Our quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated 
carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the 
Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash 
flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A 
discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless 
licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were required to make significant estimates about future cash flows and profitability 
specifically associated with our wireless licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows 
41
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and assumed terminal value and growth rates. We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and expected 
availability of wireless network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in 
estimating future cash flows and profitability. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or 
expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our 
consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date. Accordingly, our discount rate 
incorporated our estimate of the expected return a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date, including the risk 
premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation date. The terminal value growth rate represented 
our estimate of the marketplace’s long-term growth rate. 
The quantitative impairment assessment we performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses 
is substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value 
of our wireless licenses, the fair value would have still exceeded their carrying value. We do not believe reasonable changes in significant 
estimates would change the outcome to this quantitative assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 basis 
points (bps) or if the WACC increased by 50 bps, the fair value of wireless licenses would still exceed its carrying value. 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine whether it is 
more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered 
several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including 
changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, 
projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a 
whole, as well as other factors. Our annual impairment tests in 2020 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless 
licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. 
Goodwill 
To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely 
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we elect not to conduct the qualitative assessment or if 
indications of a potential impairment exist, the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires the determination of the fair 
value of each reporting unit being assessed. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessments at least every three years. During 
the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed quantitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business reporting units according to the 
policy. 
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the 
last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest 
rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent 
merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors. 
Under our quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a discounted cash flow 
method, as a form of the income approach. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash 
flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-projected cash flows and a terminal value. 
The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete 
projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete 
period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital 
(WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill 
impairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on 
discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA 
growth relative to history and market trends and expectations. The market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in 
the selection comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies was influenced by differences in growth and 
profitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse change in 
one or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future. 
A projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and may 
result in impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) more than anticipated increase in promotional 
activity, decreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to 
achieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases to long-
term interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit. 
At December 31, 2021, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $28.6 billion, of which $21.0 billion was in our Consumer reporting 
unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit. At the goodwill impairment measurement date of October 31, 2021, our quantitative 
assessments indicate that the fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units are substantially in excess of their carrying values and 
therefore did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units, the fair value of each of 
our reporting units would have still exceeded their book values. We do not anticipate reasonable changes in significant estimates to change 
the outcomes to these quantitative impairment assessments. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 bps, or if the 
WACC increased by 50 bps, the fair values of our reporting units would still exceed their respective carrying values. 
At December 31, 2020, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $24.8 billion, of which $17.2 billion was in our Consumer reporting 
unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit. We performed qualitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business 
42
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2020. Our qualitative assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair values of 
our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. 
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
We maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 
Benefit plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the determination of the substantive 
plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income, expense, assets and obligations. 
Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. 
In determining pension and other postretirement obligations, the weighted-average discount rate was selected to approximate the composite 
interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2021. The bonds selected had maturities 
that coincided with the time periods during which benefit payments are expected to occur, were non-callable and available in sufficient 
quantities to ensure marketability (at least $300 million par outstanding). Bond yields are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons 
including corporate performance, credit rating downgrades and upgrades, government fiscal policy decisions, and general market volatility. 
The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets used in determining the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations are 
based on expectations for future investment returns for the plans’ asset allocation. The rates are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons 
including corporate performance, credit ratings, monetary policy, inflation, exchange rates, investor behavior and general market volatility. 
A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets on the benefit obligations 
and expense (income) recorded, as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan 
assets as of December 31, 2021 and for the year then ended pertaining to Verizon’s pension and postretirement benefit plans, is provided in 
the table below. 
(dollars in millions) Percentage point 
change Increase/(decrease) at 
December 31, 2021 
Pension plans discount rate +0.50 $ (1,125) 
-0.50 1,249 
Rate of return on pension plan assets +1.00 (189) 
-1.00 189 
Postretirement plans discount rate +0.50 (810) 
-0.50 896 
Rate of return on postretirement plan assets +1.00 (5) 
-1.00 5 
The annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. We use the full yield curve approach to 
estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. The full yield curve approach 
refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several 
hundred high-quality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of 
each future cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost. 
See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Income Taxes 
Our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal 
course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and 
dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items. As a global commercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the classification of income 
taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing and 
amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the 
accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring 
tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best 
judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of these tax 
positions is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any 
interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may materially differ from 
estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances. See Note 12 
to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
Our Property, plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record Property, plant and 
equipment at cost. We depreciate Property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The 
estimated useful life is subject to change due to a variety of factors such as change in asset capacity or performance, technical obsolescence, 
market expectations and competition impacts. In connection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and 
equipment during 2021, we determined that the estimated useful life of our Property, plant and equipment would remain unchanged. We 
expect that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our Property, plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2021 
depreciation expense of $2.2 billion and that a one year decrease would result in an increase of approximately $3.5 billion in our 2021 
depreciation expense.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Accounts Receivable 
Prior to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable were recorded at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The gross amount of accounts 
receivable and corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts were presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintained 
allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated 
losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment receivables are 
considered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses were recorded as incurred. 
However, receivable balances were assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered 
impaired. Subsequent to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not 
expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in 
the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to 
make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management’s expectation 
of the asset’s collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the 
customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as 
management’s expectations of conditions in the future, if applicable. The impact of these factors on the allowance involves significant level of 
estimation and is subject to uncertainty. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets 
pooled together with similar risk characteristics. 
We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement 
receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is 
determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer 
by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the 
weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. The weighted-average expected loss rate decreased 0.81% at 
December 31, 2021 as compared to at December 31, 2020. We expect that an increase or decrease of 0.25% in the weighted-average loss rate 
would result in a change of $94 million in the allowance. 
We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and 
pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless 
service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month 
rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over 
the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s 
qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on 
historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as 
discussed above. 
If there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those 
currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are 
made. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Acquisitions and Divestitures 
Spectrum License Transactions 
From time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have 
allowed us to continue to enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. 
In March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands concluded. 
Verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940 licenses, which primarily consisted of 37 GHz and, to a lesser 
extent, 39 GHz spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our 39 GHz licenses provided us with incentive payments that were applied towards the 
purchase price of spectrum in the auction. The value of the licenses won by Verizon amounted to $3.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion was 
settled with the relinquished 39 GHz licenses. The new reconfigured licenses were received in the second quarter 2020 and are included in 
Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets. 
In September 2020, the FCC completed Auction 105 for Priority Access Licenses. Verizon participated in the auction and was the high bidder 
on 557 licenses in the 3.5 GHz band valued at approximately $1.9 billion. Verizon made payments for these licenses in 2020 and received 
them from the FCC in March 2021. The purchase cost for these licenses and related capitalized interest, based on qualifying activities that 
occurred, are included in Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets. 
In February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon was the winning bidder on 3,511 licenses, 
consisting of contiguous C-Band spectrum bands ranging between 140 and 200 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in all 406 markets available in 
the auction. Verizon paid $45.5 billion for the licenses it won, of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with 
the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments are for our 
allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which 
are estimated to be $7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3 billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing 
costs. In January 2022, we made additional payments of $1.4 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives. We expect to 
continue to make payments related to clearing cost and incentive payment obligations through 2024. These payments are dependent on the 
44
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
incumbent license holders accelerated clearing of the spectrum for Verizon’s use and, therefore, the final timing and amounts could differ 
based on the incumbent holders’ execution of their clearing process. In accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by 
December 2025. The carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 will consist of all payments required to participate and 
purchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon’s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the 
incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses. Carrying value will also 
include capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred. The licenses were received from the FCC in July 2021 and are 
included within Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheet. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our spectrum license transactions. 
TracFone Wireless, Inc. 
In September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (Tracfone Purchase Agreement) with América Móvil to acquire TracFone Wireless, 
Inc. (Tracfone), a leading provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. The transaction closed on November 23, 2021 (the 
Acquisition Date). In accordance with the terms of the Tracfone Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired all of Tracfone's outstanding stock in 
exchange for approximately $3.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital and other adjustments, subject to customary 
adjustments, 57,596,544 shares of Verizon common stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future 
cash contingent consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value 
of the Verizon common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the 
contingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $542 million calculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash 
flow model and significant unobservable inputs, thus representing a Level 3 measurement. The contingent consideration payable is based on 
the achievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-year earn out period, as defined in the Tracfone Purchase 
Agreement. Payments related to the contingent consideration are expected to begin in 2022 and continue through 2024. See Note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Bluegrass Cellular 
In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass, a rural wireless operator serving central 
Kentucky. Bluegrass provides wireless service to 210,000 customers in 34 counties in rural service areas 3, 4, and 5 in Central Kentucky. The 
transaction closed in March 2021. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately $412 
million, net of cash acquired, which is subject to customary closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for 
additional information. 
Blue Jeans Network, Inc. 
In April 2020, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire BlueJeans, an enterprise-grade video conferencing and event 
platform, whose services are sold to Business customers globally. The transaction closed in May 2020. The aggregate cash consideration paid 
by Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately $397 million, net of cash acquired. 
Verizon Media Divestiture 
On May 2, 2021, Verizon entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Apollo Global Management Inc. (the Apollo Affiliate) 
pursuant to which we agreed to sell Verizon Media in return for consideration of $4.3 billion in cash, subject to customary adjustments, 
$750 million in non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate, and 10% of the fully-diluted common limited 
partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate. 
On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. As of the close of the transaction, cash proceeds, the fair value of the non-
convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate, and the fair value of 10% of the fully-diluted common limited 
partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate were $4.3 billion, $496 million, and $124 million, respectively. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of 
approximately $1.0 billion (after-tax $1.0 billion) in Selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for 
the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we incurred $346 million of various costs associated with this disposition which are primarily 
recorded in Selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. See 
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Other 
From time to time, we enter into strategic agreements to acquire various other businesses and investments. See Note 3 to the consolidated 
financial statements for additional information. 
In December 2021, we completed the sale of our investment in the Complex Media business. In connection with this transaction, we recorded 
a pre-tax gain of $131 million in Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated statement of income for the year 
ended December 31, 2021. 
In November 2020, Verizon entered into an agreement to sell our Huffington Post business. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a 
pre-tax loss of $126 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended 
December 31, 2020. The transaction closed in February 2021.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign 
currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk 
management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate 
swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, treasury rate locks and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading 
purposes. 
It is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our 
desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to 
lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in 
market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest 
rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings. 
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA 
master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. The CSA agreements contain 
rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding 
positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative 
instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from 
derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December 31, 2021, we held and posted $0.1 billion and an insignificant amount, 
respectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange agreements, which were recorded as Other current 
liabilities and Prepaid expenses and other, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, we held $0.2 billion of 
collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Other current liabilities in our 
consolidated balance sheet. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk 
remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
due to our diversified pool of counterparties. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 
derivative portfolio. 
Interest Rate Risk 
We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest 
rates. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 81% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed-rate 
indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest 
rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, including our interest rate swap agreements that are 
designated as hedges, of approximately $288 million. The interest rates on our existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by changes 
to our credit ratings. 
Certain of our floating rate debt and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the London Inter-
Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent U.S. and international regulatory guidance for reform. The 
one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates ceased publication after December 31, 2021, and other U.S. dollar LIBOR rates will cease 
publication after June 30, 2023. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the 
cost of our floating rate debt or exposure under our interest rate derivative transactions. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our 
financial position given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt, taking into account the impact of our interest rate hedging. The 
floating rate senior unsecured notes issued in March 2021 and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are 
linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the benchmark rate. 
The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and interest rate swap derivatives as of 
December 31, 2021 and 2020. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments 
assuming 100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield curve. Our sensitivity analysis does not include the fair values of our 
commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates.

Interest Rate Swaps 
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable 
rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest 
rate risk exposure of designated debt issuances. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was 
$473 million and $666 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was 
$787 million and $303 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was 
$19.8 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps 
We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to interest rate 
changes on future forecasted transactions. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $302 million 
and $797 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of the forward starting interest rate swaps was 
$1.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. 
Treasury Rate Locks 
We enter into treasury rate locks to mitigate our interest rate risk. We recognize gains and losses resulting from interest rate movements in 
Other comprehensive income (loss). There was no outstanding notional amount for treasury rate locks at December 31, 2021 or 2020. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency. The translation of income statement and balance sheet 
amounts of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated 
other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recorded in the 
consolidated statements of income in Other income (expense), net. At December 31, 2021, our primary translation exposure was to the British 
Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Japanese Yen. 
Cross Currency Swaps 
We have entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, 
Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to 
mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. The fair value of the asset of these contracts was $589 million and 
$1.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of the liability of these contracts 
was $1.6 billion and $196 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of the cross currency swaps was 
$32.5 billion and $26.3 billion, respectively. 
Foreign Exchange Forwards 
We also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. 
We enter into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional 
currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of the asset of these 
contracts was insignificant and there is no amount related to the liability of these contracts. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of the asset 
and liability of these contracts was insignificant. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of the foreign exchange forwards 
was $932 million and $1.4 billion, respectively.

  Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.: 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, 
based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Verizon maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. 
As indicated in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of 
and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of TracFone Wireless, Inc. 
(Tracfone), which is included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of Verizon and constituted approximately 3% of total assets, as of 
December 31, 2021 and less than 1% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the 
Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Tracfone. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 
consolidated balance sheets of Verizon as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive 
income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and 
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 11, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion 
thereon. 
Basis for Opinion 
Verizon’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We 
are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Verizon in accordance with the 
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other 
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Reporting of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.: 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries (Verizon) as of 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at 
Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Verizon at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), 
Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated 
February 11, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of Verizon’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon’s financial 
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect 
to Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits 
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was 
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the 
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit 
matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the 
critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of Employee Benefit Obligations 
Description of the Matter The Company sponsors several pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans. At December 31, 2021, 
the Company’s aggregate defined benefit pension obligation was $20.2 billion and exceeded the fair value of 
pension plan assets of $20.1 billion, resulting in an unfunded defined benefit pension obligation of $0.1 billion. 
Also, at December 31, 2021, the other postretirement benefits obligation was approximately $14.7 billion. As 
explained in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to 
measure employee benefit obligations and plan assets in the fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to 
reflect the actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. 
Auditing the employee benefit obligations was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial 
assumptions (e.g., discount rate, health care cost trends, per capita claims cost trends and mortality rates) used in 
the measurement process. These assumptions had a significant effect on the projected benefit obligation. 
How We Addressed the 
Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the 
employee benefits obligation valuation process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of 
the employee benefit obligation calculations, the significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided 
to the actuary. 
To test the employee benefit obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the 
methodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the 
Company. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends, current economic 
factors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from prior year due to the change in service 
cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we 
involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount 
rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit 
obligations. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and 
compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. To evaluate the health care cost 
trends, per capita claims cost trends and the mortality rates, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in 
evaluating the assumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available 
information, and whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied. We also tested 
the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to management’s 
actuarial specialists.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Description of Business 
Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s 
leading providers of communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and 
government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms 
that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon 
Business Group (Business). 
Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are 
provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and 
other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are 
provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through 
our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer 
segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network 
access from us on a wholesale basis. 
Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, 
corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver 
various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these 
products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services 
to customers around the world. 
Consolidation 
The method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity, involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the 
investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial 
statements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. 
For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and Total equity. Investments 
in businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted 
for using the equity method. Equity method investments are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance 
sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
Basis of Presentation 
We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. 
Use of Estimates 
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and 
forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from COVID-19 
pandemic and public and private sector policies and initiatives aimed at reducing its transmission. As the extent and duration of the impacts 
from COVID-19 remain unclear, the Company’s estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change. Actual results could differ 
significantly from those estimates. 
Examples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and 
equipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, including those related 
to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in 
connection with business combinations. 
Revenue Recognition 
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the 
sale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business 
customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated managed 
services for our large enterprises and government customers. We account for these revenues under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 
2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606).
56
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), 
captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device 
payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent.  
Nature of Products and Services 
Telecommunications 
Service 
We offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an 
output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our 
performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a 
contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage 
represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the 
option (typically on a month-to-month basis). 
For our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month 
in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is 
rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While 
substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not 
fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs. 
Equipment 
We sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the 
products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of 
equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a 
service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans. 
Under a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering 
into a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less). 
Under a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid 
by the customer, typically over a 24 or 30-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may 
offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The 
credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are 
recognized when earned. 
A financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which 
occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of 
the device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-
term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations related to our customer classes. These 
considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing 
in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current 
facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold 
through the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately. See Note 8 for additional information on the interest 
on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel. 
Wireless Contracts 
For our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is 
allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price 
of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price 
of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty 
(i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we 
also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as 
penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month 
wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our 
determination of the transaction price and related disclosures. 
From time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new 
device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We 
account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability 
and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The guarantee liability was $77 million and insignificant at 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total transaction price is reduced by the guarantee, which is accounted for outside the scope 
of Topic 606, and the remaining transaction price is allocated between the performance obligations within the contract.
57
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Our fixed-term plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at subsidized prices. This results in the creation of a contract asset at the 
time of sale, which represents the recognition of equipment revenue in excess of amounts billed. 
For our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination 
of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability. 
We may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable 
consideration when determining the transaction price, and accordingly we recognize revenue based on the estimated amount to which we 
expect to be entitled after considering expected returns. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each 
reporting period as additional information becomes available. We also may provide credits or incentives on our products and services for 
contracts with resellers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. 
Wireline Contracts 
Total consideration for wireline services that are bundled in a single contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on our 
standalone selling price for each service. While many contracts include one or more service performance obligations, the revenue recognition 
pattern is generally not impacted by the allocation since the services are generally satisfied over the same period of time. We estimate the 
standalone selling price to be the price of the services when sold on a standalone basis without any promotional discount. In addition, we also 
assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers such as 
penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and 
obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of transaction price and related disclosures. 
We may provide performance-based credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with our Business customers, which are 
accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the transaction price. Credits are estimated at contract inception and are updated at 
the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. 
Wireless and Wireline Contracts 
For offers that include third-party providers, we evaluate whether we are acting as the principal or as the agent with respect to the goods or 
services provided to the customer. This principal-versus-agent assessment involves judgment and focuses on whether the facts and 
circumstances of the arrangement indicate that the goods or services were controlled by us prior to transferring them to the customer. To 
evaluate if we have control, we consider various factors including whether we are primarily responsible for fulfillment, bear risk of loss and 
have discretion over pricing. 
Other 
Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising revenue is generated by the 
display of graphical advertisements and other performance-based advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated when a consumer clicks 
on a text-based advertisement on the search results page. The divested Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media), primarily earned revenue 
through display advertising on Verizon Media properties, as well as on third-party properties through our advertising platforms, search 
advertising, and subscription arrangements. Revenue for display and search advertising contracts is recognized as ads are delivered, while 
subscription contracts are recognized over time. We are generally the principal in transactions carried out through our advertising platforms, 
and therefore report gross revenue based on the amount billed to our customers. The control and transfer of digital advertising inventory 
occurs in a rapid, real-time environment, where our proprietary technology enables us to identify, enhance, verify and solely control digital 
advertising inventory that we then sell to our customers. Our control is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers 
for fulfillment and the fact that we can exercise a level of discretion over pricing. We completed the sale of Verizon Media on September 1, 
2021. See Note 3 for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media. 
We offer telematics services including smart fleet management and optimization software. Telematics service revenue is generated primarily 
through subscription contracts. We recognize revenue over time for our subscription contracts. 
We report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions on a net basis. 
Maintenance and Repairs 
We charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, 
principally to Cost of services as these costs are incurred. 
Advertising Costs 
Costs for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general and 
administrative expense in the periods in which they are incurred. See Note 15 for additional information. 
Earnings Per Common Share 
Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, 
diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans.
58
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
There were a total of approximately 2 million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the 
computation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash 
equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates quoted market value and includes amounts held in money market funds. 
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables collateralizing asset-backed debt securities are required at certain 
specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in 
Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in the following line items in the consolidated balance sheets: 
(dollars in millions) 
At December 31, 2021 2020 Increase / 
(Decrease) 
Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,921 $ 22,171 $ (19,250) 
Restricted cash: 
Prepaid expenses and other 1,094 1,195 (101) 
Other assets 146 132 14 
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 4,161 $ 23,498 $ (19,337) 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities 
Investments in equity securities that are not accounted for under equity method accounting or result in consolidation are to be measured at fair 
value. For investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, Verizon elects the measurement alternative permitted 
under GAAP to measure these investments at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in 
orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. For investments in debt securities without quoted prices, Verizon 
uses an alternative matrix pricing method. Investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation of the investee are included in 
Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt securities are included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Allowance for Credit Losses 
Prior to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable were recorded at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The gross amount of accounts 
receivable and corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts were presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintained 
allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated 
losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment receivables are 
considered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses were recorded as incurred. 
However, receivable balances were assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered 
impaired. Subsequent to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not 
expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in 
the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to 
make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management’s expectation 
of the asset’s collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the 
customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as 
management’s expectations of conditions in the future, if applicable. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of 
the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics. 
We pool our device payment plan agreement receivables based on the credit quality indicators and shared risk characteristics of "new 
customers" and "existing customers." New customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for less than 210 days. Existing 
customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for 210 days or more. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to 
the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default 
and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other 
qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then 
aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance 
balance. 
We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and 
pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless 
service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month 
rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over 
the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s 
qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on 
historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as 
discussed above.

Inventories 
Inventory consists of wireless and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost (determined principally on either an 
average cost or first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. 
Plant and Depreciation 
We record property, plant and equipment at cost. Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis. 
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, 
calculated from the time the asset was placed in service. 
When depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the property, 
plant and equipment accounts and any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense. 
We capitalize and depreciate network software purchased or developed within property, plant and equipment assets. We also capitalize 
interest associated with the acquisition or construction of network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest 
expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-related assets. 
Computer Software and Cloud Computing Costs 
We capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software and defer the costs associated with cloud computing arrangements 
that have a useful life and term in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use network and non-
network software are capitalized only to the extent that they add significant new functionality. Planning, software maintenance and training 
costs for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. We capitalize 
interest associated with the development of internal-use network and non-network software. Capitalized non-network internal-use software 
costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 5 to 7 years and are included in Other intangible assets, net in our 
consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred in implementing a cloud computing arrangement are deferred during the application-development 
stage and recorded as Prepaid expense and Other in our consolidated balance sheets. Once a project is substantially complete and ready for its 
intended use, we stop deferring the related cloud computing arrangement costs. 
For a discussion of our impairment policy for capitalized software costs, see "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" below. Also, see Note 4 
for additional information of internal-use non-network software reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Similar to capitalized software 
costs, deferred costs associated with cloud computing arrangements are subject to impairment testing. 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Impairment testing for 
goodwill is performed annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. 
To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment. However, we may elect to bypass 
the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist. It is our policy to 
perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. 
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the 
last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest 
rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization (EBITDA) margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance 
of the reporting unit, as well as other factors. 
The quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level and compares the fair value of the reporting unit 
(calculated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach) to its carrying 
value. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy, see "Fair Value Measurements" discussion 
below for additional information. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to corroborate 
discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components, projected cash flows and a 
terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the 
discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the 
discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, 
or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an 
impairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. 
During the fourth quarter each year, we update our five-year strategic planning review for each of our reporting units. Those plans consider 
current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our view of growth-rates and anticipated future economic and 
regulatory conditions. 
See Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization 
A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize 
designated radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally 
ten years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely 
and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other 
factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We 
re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an 
indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an 
integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. 
We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to 
first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect 
to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to 
perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. 
As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, 
macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry 
revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance 
of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests. 
Our quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated 
carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the 
Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash 
flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A 
discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless 
licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of 
the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized. 
Interest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of 
wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for 
its intended use. 
Wireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and 
purchase licenses are recorded within Deposits for wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are 
received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets 
Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over 
their estimated useful lives. All of our intangible assets subject to amortization and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of 
impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash 
flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would 
perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate the useful life 
determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining 
useful lives. 
See Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major 
components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets. 
Leases 
We lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark 
fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an 
arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for 
separately, we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement 
date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use. 
For both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease 
term, and a lease liability, which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present 
value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing 
rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to 
the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Management uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to 
approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis. 
61
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
In those circumstances where the Company is the lessee, we account for non-lease components associated with our leases (e.g., common area 
maintenance costs) and lease components as a single lease component for substantially all of our asset classes. Additionally, in arrangements 
where we are the lessor, we have customer premise equipment for which we account for non-lease components (e.g., service revenue) and 
lease components as combined components under the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606 as the service revenues are the predominant 
components in the arrangements. 
Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in either Cost of services or 
Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income, based on the use of the facility or equipment on which 
rent is being paid. Variable rent payments related to both operating and finance leases are expensed in the period incurred. Our variable lease 
payments consist of payments dependent on various external indicators, including real estate taxes, common area maintenance charges and 
utility usage. 
Operating leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets; we recognize rent expense for these 
leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
We recognize the amortization of the right-of-use asset for our finance leases on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the 
useful life of the right-of-use asset in Depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of income. The interest expense 
related to finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method based on the discount rate determined at lease commencement and is 
included within Interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. 
See Note 6 for additional information related to leases, including disclosure required under ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). 
Fair Value Measurements 
Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in 
measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows: 
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
Level 3 — Unobservable pricing inputs in the market 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value 
measurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the 
valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy. 
Income Taxes 
Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the 
various jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. 
Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be 
realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is 
recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of 
any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the 
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full 
knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition 
threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest 
amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in 
a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability 
for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax 
liability. 
Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on 
estimated fair values. See Note 10 for additional information. 
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions 
The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency. For these foreign entities, we translate their financial 
statements into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period for income statement amounts and using end-of-period exchange rates 
62
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
for assets and liabilities. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of Equity, 
in our consolidated balance sheets. We record exchange gains and losses resulting from the conversion of transaction currency to functional 
currency as a component of Other income (expense), net. 
Employee Benefit Plans 
Pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year, as well as interest on projected benefit obligations, 
are accrued. Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service 
period of the employees expected to receive benefits. Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the return on assets 
assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net in the year in 
which they occur. These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management 
employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the Company retiree medical subsidy. See Note 11 for additional 
information. 
We recognize a pension or a postretirement plan’s funded status as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we 
measure any unrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive 
income, net of applicable income tax. 
Derivative Instruments 
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward 
starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold 
derivatives for trading purposes. 
We measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative 
instruments are valued primarily using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative 
contracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments applied as economic hedges are recognized in 
earnings in the current period. For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings, along 
with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is 
reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net 
investment hedges of certain of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is reported in Other 
comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially offsets the impact of foreign currency changes on 
the value of our net investment. 
Cash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges or applied as economic hedges, are presented consistently with the 
cash flow classification of the related hedged items. See Note 9 for additional information. 
Variable Interest Entities 
VIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from 
other parties, have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting 
rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. We 
consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party that has 
the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or 
the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
The following ASU was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and has been recently adopted by Verizon. 
DescriptionDate of 
AdoptionEffect on Financial Statements 
ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with 
Customers 
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08. The guidance 
requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and 
contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in 
accordance with Topic 606. The standard is effective for fiscal 
years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim 
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, 
including adoption in an interim period. The guidance is applied 
retrospectively to all business combinations for which the 
acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year 
of adoption. 11/1/2021 Verizon has elected to early adopt this Topic effective 
November 1, 2021, and has retroactively applied this 
guidance to all business combinations that took place on 
or after January 1, 2021. The adoption resulted in the 
recognition of contract liabilities at amounts consistent 
with those recorded by TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone) 
immediately before the acquisition date. The adoption had 
no impact on other business combinations in 2021. 
See Note 3 for additional information on the acquisition of 
Tracfone. 
ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) 
Topic 848 provides temporary optional guidance to ease the 
potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. Topic 
848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying 
U.S. GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate reform if 
certain criteria are met. 03/12/2020 Topic 848 was effective for the Company beginning on 
March 12, 2020, and we will apply the amendments 
prospectively through December 31, 2022. There was no 
impact to our consolidated financial statements for the 
current period as a result of adopting this standard update. 
On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) using the modified retrospective approach. 
The cumulative after-tax effect of the changes made to our consolidated financial statements for the adoption of Topic 326 was as follows: 
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 
2019 Adjustments due to 
Topic 326 At January 1, 2020 
Retained earnings 53,147 (200) 52,947 
See Note 8 for additional information related to credit losses, including disclosures required under Topic 326. 
On January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842 using the modified retrospective approach. The cumulative after-tax effect of the changes made to 
our consolidated financial statements for the adoption of Topic 842 was as follows: 
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 
2018 Adjustments due 
to Topic 842 At January 1, 2019 
Retained earnings $ 43,542 $ 410 $ 43,952 
Noncontrolling interests 1,565 1 1,566 
Note 2. Revenue and Contract Costs 
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the 
sale of wireless equipment. 
Revenue by Category 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units, Consumer and Business. Revenue is disaggregated 
by products and services within Consumer, and customer groups (Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, 
and Wholesale) within Business. See Note 13 for additional information on revenue by segment. 
Corporate and other primarily includes insurance captives as well as the historical results of the divested Verizon Media. On September 1, 
2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media to an affiliate of Apollo Global Management Inc. Under our ownership, Verizon Media 
generated revenues from contracts with customers under Topic 606 of approximately $5.3 billion, $7.0 billion and $7.5 billion for the years 
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 3 for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media. 
We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), 
captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device 
payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent. As allowed by the practical expedient within Topic 842, we have 
elected to combine the lease and non-lease components for those arrangements of customer premise equipment where we are the 
lessor as components accounted for under Topic 606. Revenues from arrangements that were not accounted for under Topic 606 were 
approximately $3.1 billion, $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
64
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Remaining Performance Obligations 
When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price may relate to 
service performance obligations which were not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period. Below we disclose 
information relating to these unsatisfied performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient available under Topic 606 that provides 
the option to exclude the expected revenues arising from unsatisfied performance obligations related to contracts that have an original 
expected duration of one year or less. This situation primarily arises with respect to certain month-to-month service contracts. At 
December 31, 2021, month-to-month service contracts represented approximately 93% of our wireless postpaid contracts and 86% of our 
wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts, compared to December 31, 2020, for which month-to-month service contracts 
represented approximately 90% of our wireless postpaid contracts and 75% of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business 
contracts. 
Additionally, certain contracts provide customers the option to purchase additional services. The fees related to these additional services are 
recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis). 
Contracts for wireless services, with or without promotional credits that require maintenance of service, are generally either month-to-month 
and cancellable at any time (typically under a device payment plan) or considered to contain terms ranging from greater than one month to up 
to thirty months (typically under a fixed-term plan). Additionally, customers may incur charges based on usage or additional optional services 
purchased in conjunction with entering into a contract that can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not included in the transaction price. 
The transaction price allocated to service performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the 
reporting period, are generally related to contracts that are not accounted for as month-to-month contracts. 
Our Consumer group customers also include traditional wholesale resellers that purchase and resell wireless service under their own brands to 
their respective customers. Reseller arrangements generally include a stated contract term, which typically extends longer than two years and, 
in some cases, include a periodic minimum revenue commitment over the contract term for which revenues will be recognized in future 
periods. 
Consumer customer contracts for wireline services are generally month-to-month; however, they may have a service term of two years or 
shorter than twelve months. Certain contracts with Business customers for wireline services extend into future periods, contain fixed monthly 
fees and usage-based fees, and can include annual commitments in each year of the contract or commitments over the entire specified contract 
term; however, a significant number of contracts for wireline services with our Business customers have a contract term that is twelve months 
or less. 
Additionally, there are certain contracts with Business customers for wireline and telematics services that have a contractual minimum fee 
over the total contract term. We cannot predict the time period when revenue will be recognized related to those contracts; thus, they are 
excluded from the time bands below. These contracts have varying terms spanning over approximately nine years ending in August 2031 and 
have aggregate contract minimum payments totaling $2.4 billion. 
At December 31, 2021, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations for total Verizon that is expected to be recognized 
for 2022, 2023 and thereafter was $17.0 billion, $8.3 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Remaining performance obligation estimates are 
subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations and changes in the timing and scope of contracts, arising from 
contract modifications. 
Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances 
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our customers. Receivables presented in our consolidated balance 
sheets represent an unconditional right to consideration. Contract balances represent amounts from an arrangement when either Verizon has 
performed, by transferring goods or services to the customer in advance of receiving all or partial consideration for such goods and services 
from the customer, or the customer has made payment to Verizon in advance of obtaining control of the goods and/or services promised to the 
customer in the contract. 
The following table presents information about receivables from contracts with customers: 
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 
2021 At December 31, 
2020 At January 1, 
2020 
Receivables(1) $ 10,758 $ 12,029 $ 12,078 
Device payment plan agreement receivables(2) 12,888 10,358 11,741 
(1) Balances do not include receivables related to the following contracts: leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), 
captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device 
payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent. 
(2) Included in device payment plan agreement receivables presented in Note 8. Receivables derived from the sale of equipment on a device 
payment plan through an authorized agent.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
The following table presents information about contract balances: 
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 
2021 At December 31, 
2020 At January 1, 
2020 
Contract asset $ 934 $ 937 $ 1,150 
Contract liability 7,229 5,598 5,307 
Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for goods or services provided to customers but for which we do not have an 
unconditional right at the reporting date. Under a fixed-term plan, total contract revenue is allocated between wireless service and equipment 
revenues. In conjunction with these arrangements, a contract asset is created, which represents the difference between the amount of 
equipment revenue recognized upon sale and the amount of consideration received from the customer when the performance obligation 
related to the transfer of control of the equipment is satisfied. The contract asset is reclassified to accounts receivable as wireless services are 
provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as service is provided over time, which results in our right to the payment being 
unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. 
We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's expectation of the asset's 
collectability. 
Contract assets remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2021. Contract assets decreased $213 million during the year 
ended December 31, 2020 and was primarily due to reclassifications to accounts receivable due to billings on existing contracts and 
impairment charges of $75 million, partially offset by new contracts driven by customer activity related to wireless. 
Contract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive consideration in advance of providing the goods or services promised in the 
contract. We typically bill service one month in advance, which is the primary component of the contract liability balance. Contract liabilities 
are recognized as revenue when services are provided to the customer. The contract liability balances are presented in our consolidated 
balance sheets as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities. 
Contract liabilities increased $1.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in contract liabilities was primarily due to 
increases in sales promotions recognized over time and upfront fees, increases in deferred revenue related to advanced billings, as well as the 
acquisition of Tracfone, partially offset by the satisfaction of performance obligations related to wireless and Fios services, as well as the sale 
of Verizon Media. Contract liabilities increased $291 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in contract liabilities was 
primarily due to increases in sales promotions recognized over time and upfront fees, as well as increases in deferred revenue related to 
advanced billings, partially offset by the satisfaction of performance obligations related to wireless and Fios services. 
Revenue recognized during both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 related to contract liabilities existing at January 1, 2021 and 
2020 were $4.3 billion, respectively, as performance obligations related to services were satisfied. 
The balance of contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows: 
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 
2021 At December 31, 
2020 
Assets 
Prepaid expenses and other $ 739 $ 733 
Other assets 195 204

Other liabilities 1,176 755 
Total $ 7,229 $ 5,598 
Contract Costs 
As discussed in Note 1, Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, which are then 
amortized to expense over the respective periods of expected benefit. We recognize an asset for incremental commission expenses paid to 
internal and external sales personnel and agents in conjunction with obtaining customer contracts. We only defer these costs when we have 
determined the commissions are incremental costs that would not have been incurred absent the customer contract and are expected to be 
recoverable. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as commission expense over the period representing the transfer of 
goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain wireless contracts are amortized over both of our Consumer and Business 
customers' estimated device upgrade cycles, as such costs are typically incurred each time a customer upgrades. Costs to obtain wireline 
contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer relationship period for our Consumer customers. Incremental costs to obtain 
wireline contracts for our Business customers are insignificant. Costs to obtain contracts are recorded in Selling, general and administrative 
expense.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
We also defer costs incurred to fulfill contracts that: (1) relate directly to the contract; (2) are expected to generate resources that will be used 
to satisfy our performance obligation under the contract; and (3) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. 
Contract fulfillment costs are expensed as we satisfy our performance obligations and recorded in Cost of services. These costs principally 
relate to direct costs that enhance our wireline business resources, such as costs incurred to install circuits. 
We determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract at a portfolio level due to the similarities 
within these customer contract portfolios. 
Other costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as incurred. 
Collectively, costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as deferred contract costs, and amortized over a two-to six-
year period. Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets, respectively. 
The balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows: 
(dollars in millions) At December 31, 
2021 At December 31, 
2020 
Assets 
Prepaid expenses and other $ 2,432 $ 2,472 
Other assets 2,259 2,070 
Total $ 4,691 $ 4,542 
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized expense of $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, associated with the 
amortization of deferred contract costs, primarily within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of 
income. 
We assess our deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying 
amount of a deferred cost exceeds the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services related 
to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those goods and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. There 
have been no impairment charges recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures 
Spectrum License Transactions 
In March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands concluded. 
Verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940 licenses, which primarily consisted of 37 GHz and, to a lesser 
extent, 39 GHz spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our 39 GHz licenses provided us with incentive payments that were applied towards the 
purchase price of spectrum in the auction. The value of the licenses won by Verizon amounted to $3.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion was 
settled with the relinquished 39 GHz licenses. The remaining balance was settled in cash of $1.6 billion, of which $101 million was paid 
during the fourth quarter in 2019. In connection with the incentive auction, a pre-tax net loss of $1.2 billion ($914 million after-tax) was 
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income during 2020 because the exchange of the 
previously held licenses for new licenses had commercial substance. See Note 4 for additional information. The new reconfigured licenses 
were received in the second quarter 2020 and are included in Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets. 
In September 2020, the FCC completed Auction 105 for Priority Access Licenses. Verizon participated in the auction and was the high bidder 
on 557 licenses in the 3.5 GHz band valued at approximately $1.9 billion for the licenses. Verizon made payments for these licenses in 2020 
and received them from the FCC in March 2021. Upon receiving, these wireless licenses, including capitalized interest, based on qualifying 
activities that occurred, were reclassified from Deposits for wireless licenses to Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheet. 
In February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon was the winning bidder on 3,511 licenses, 
consisting of contiguous C-Band spectrum bands ranging between 140 and 200 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in all 406 markets available in 
the auction. Verizon paid $45.5 billion for the licenses it won, of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with 
the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments are for our  
allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which 
are estimated to be $7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3 billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing 
costs. In January 2022, we made additional payments of $1.4 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives, which were 
accrued as of December 31, 2021 in our consolidated balance sheet. We expect to continue to make payments related to clearing cost and 
incentive payment obligations through 2024. These payments are dependent on the incumbent license holders accelerated clearing of the 
spectrum for Verizon’s use and, therefore, the final timing and amounts could differ based on the incumbent holders’ execution of their 
clearing process. In accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by December 2025. 
The carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 will consist of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in 
the auction, including Verizon’s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders 
associated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses. The licenses were received from the FCC in July

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
2021. Upon receiving, these wireless licenses, including capitalized interest, based on qualifying activities that occurred, were reclassified 
from Deposits for wireless licenses to Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheet. The average remaining renewal period for these 
acquired licenses was 15 years. 
See Note 7 for additional information on significant debt transactions. 
During 2021 and 2020, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash consideration of $95 million and 
$360 million, respectively. During 2021, we recognized a pre-tax loss in connection with the sale of certain wireless licenses of $223 million 
($167 million after tax). 
Business Acquisitions 
In 2021, we completed the acquisitions of Tracfone and Bluegrass Cellular (Bluegrass). The aggregate impact to total operating revenues 
arising from these acquisitions amounted to less than 1% for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
TracFone Wireless, Inc. 
In September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (Tracfone Purchase Agreement) with América Móvil to acquire Tracfone, a leading 
provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. The transaction closed on November 23, 2021 (the Acquisition Date). The 
acquisition positions Verizon as the leading prepaid, value and premium wireless carrier by expanding Verizon’s portfolio, bringing enhanced 
access of our wireless network and comprehensive suite of mobility products and services to a new customer base. 
In accordance with the terms of the Tracfone Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired all of Tracfone's outstanding stock in exchange for  
approximately $3.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital and other adjustments, subject to customary adjustments, 
57,596,544 shares of Verizon common stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future cash 
contingent consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value of 
the Verizon common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the 
contingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $542 million and represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in 
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. See Note 9 for additional information. The contingent consideration payable is based on 
the achievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-year earn out period, as defined in the Tracfone Purchase 
Agreement. Payments related to the contingent consideration are expected to begin in 2022 and continue through 2024. 
Tracfone's financial results are included in the consolidated results of Verizon from the Acquisition Date. 
The Tracfone acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. We are currently assessing, as of the Acquisition Date, the 
identification and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values, which are determined using a 
combination of the income and market approaches, including market based assumptions. The purchase consideration was preliminarily 
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the Acquisition Date. 
The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the consideration paid and payable to the identified assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed as of the Acquisition Date. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and is subject to revision as additional information 
about the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including related deferred income taxes, become available.

Other intangible assets include $2.3 billion related to customer relationships, with a weighted-average amortization period of 6 years, 
$1.3 billion related to distribution relationships, with a weighted-average amortization period of 5 years, $744 million related to trade names 
with a weighted-average amortization period of 16.5 years and $110 million related to acquired technology, with a weighted-average 
amortization period of 10 years. The intangible assets were assigned preliminary estimated fair values using an income approach. The 
valuations are considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant inputs not observable in the market, which include the 
discount rate, royalty rate and amount and timing of future cash flows. 
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the Acquisition Date fair value of the consideration paid and payable and the fair value of the 
net assets acquired, representing future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. None of the goodwill 
resulting from the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill related to this acquisition is included within the Consumer 
segment. 
Pursuant to the Tracfone Purchase Agreement, América Móvil agreed to indemnify Verizon against pre-acquisition tax matters. As of the 
Acquisition Date, we have recorded uncertain tax liabilities and offsetting indemnification assets of $730 million, for the expected 
reimbursement of tax related matters that had not been resolved as of the Acquisition Date. The liabilities are presented in Other liabilities, 
and the indemnification assets are presented in Other assets, within our consolidated balance sheets. We expect that any additional liabilities 
that may arise related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by América Móvil. 
Pro forma financial information has not been disclosed for the acquisition of Tracfone as the impacts to both revenue and earnings would not 
have been significant to our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. 
Bluegrass Cellular 
In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass Cellular, a rural wireless operator serving 
central Kentucky. Bluegrass provides wireless service to 210,000 customers in 34 counties in rural service areas 3, 4, and 5 in Central 
Kentucky. The transaction closed in March 2021. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the transaction was 
approximately $412 million, net of cash acquired, which is subject to customary closing adjustments. 
The financial results of Bluegrass are included in the consolidated results of Verizon from the date of acquisition. 
The acquisition of Bluegrass was accounted for as a business combination. We are currently assessing the identification and measurement of 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the close of the acquisition. Preliminarily, we recorded 
approximately $141 million of plant, property and equipment, $135 million of intangible assets and $92 million of goodwill. Goodwill is 
calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets 
acquired. The goodwill represents future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill related to 
this acquisition is included within the Consumer segment.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Blue Jeans Network, Inc. 
In April 2020, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Blue Jeans Network, Inc. (BlueJeans), an enterprise-grade video 
conferencing and event platform, whose services are sold to Business customers globally. The transaction closed in May 2020. The aggregate 
cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately $397 million, net of cash acquired. 
The acquisition of BlueJeans was accounted for as a business combination. The consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the close of the acquisition. We recorded approximately $246 million of goodwill and 
$190 million of other intangible assets, which primarily consisted of customer lists and internally developed technology. Goodwill is 
calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets 
acquired. The goodwill represents future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill related to 
this acquisition is included within the Business segment. 
Verizon Media Divestiture 
On May 2, 2021, Verizon entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Apollo Global Management Inc. (the Apollo Affiliate) 
pursuant to which we agreed to sell Verizon Media in return for consideration of $4.3 billion in cash, subject to customary adjustments, 
$750 million in non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate and 10% of the fully-diluted common limited 
partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate. 
On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. As of the close of the transaction, cash proceeds, the fair value of the non-
convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate and the fair value of 10% of the fully-diluted common limited 
partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate were $4.3 billion, $496 million, and $124 million, respectively. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of 
approximately $1.0 billion (after-tax $1.0 billion) in Selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for 
the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we incurred $346 million of various costs associated with this disposition which are primarily 
recorded in Selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Upon the closing of the transaction, Verizon’s preferred limited partnership interest in the Apollo Affiliate and 10% common interest in the 
Apollo Affiliate were recognized at their initial fair value of $496 million and $124 million, respectively. The fair values were both estimated 
using a combination of the market approach and the income approach. The valuations are both considered Level 3 fair value measurements 
due to the use of significant judgment and unobservable inputs, which include the amount and timing of future cash flows, and a discount rate 
reflecting risks inherent in the future cash flows and market prices. Verizon’s preferred limited partnership interest is accounted for at cost, 
and is subject to impairment and other changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar 
investments of the issuer. On September 28, 2021, the Apollo Affiliate redeemed $100 million of Verizon’s preferred limited partnership 
interest reducing the carrying value of our preferred interest as of December 31, 2021 to $396 million. The redemption is reflected within Net 
cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021. Verizon’s 10% common 
interest in the Apollo Affiliate is accounted for as an equity method investment. The post-sale results of Verizon’s common ownership interest 
in the Apollo Affiliate are recorded through the equity method of accounting, within Corporate and other. 
The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities which were disposed as a result of the closing of the transaction: 
(dollars in millions) September 1,

In connection with the closing of the transaction, we entered into Transition Services Agreements with the Apollo Affiliate, under which 
Verizon will continue to provide and receive specified administrative and technical services to support operations for up to 12 months and 18 
months, respectively.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Other 
During 2021 and 2020, we completed various other acquisitions for cash consideration of approximately $51 million and $127 million, 
respectively. 
In December 2021, we completed the sale of our investment in the Complex Media business. In connection with this transaction, we recorded 
a pre-tax gain of $131 million in Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated statement of income for the year 
ended December 31, 2021. 
In November 2020, Verizon entered into an agreement to sell our Huffington Post business. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a 
pre-tax loss of $126 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended 
December 31, 2020. The transaction closed in February 2021. 
Note 4. Wireless Licenses, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
Wireless Licenses 
The carrying amounts of Wireless licenses, as well as wireless spectrum for which licenses had not yet been received, are as follows: 
(dollars in millions) 
At December 31, 2021 2020 
Wireless licenses $ 147,619 $ 96,097 
Deposits for wireless licenses — 2,772 
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately $54.9 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, of wireless licenses were under development for 
commercial service for which we were capitalizing interest costs. We recorded approximately $1.6 billion and $242 million of capitalized 
interest on wireless licenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
In July 2021, we received the wireless licenses won in connection with the FCC's auction for C-Band wireless spectrum, Auction 107. As a 
result, these wireless licenses, including capitalized interest, based on qualifying activities that occurred, were reclassified from Deposits for 
wireless licenses to Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 3 for additional information regarding spectrum license 
transactions. 
In the first quarter of 2020, we reclassified substantially all of our 39 GHz wireless licenses, including capitalized interest, with a carrying 
value of $2.8 billion to assets held for sale in connection with the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103. As a result, these wireless licenses 
were adjusted down to their fair value of $1.6 billion resulting in a pre-tax loss of $1.2 billion ($914 million after-tax) in 2020. The new 
reconfigured licenses were received in the second quarter 2020 and had a value of $3.4 billion. See Note 3 for additional information 
regarding spectrum license transactions. 
During 2021 and 2020, we renewed various wireless licenses in accordance with FCC regulations with an average renewal period of 11 years 
and 10 years, respectively. See Note 1 for additional information. 
As discussed in Note 1, we test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are 
present. In 2021, our quantitative impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses estimated 
using the Greenfield approach to the aggregated carrying amount of the licenses as of the test date. In 2020 and 2019, we performed a 
qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying 
amount. Our annual assessments in 2021, 2020 and 2019 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the carrying value and, 
therefore, did not result in impairment. 
Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional 
capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and 
maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities.

(1) Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment charges of $4.8 billion, related to our historical Media reporting unit, which included Verizon 
Media. On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. See Note 3 for additional information. 
(2) Changes in goodwill due to acquisitions is related to BlueJeans and an other insignificant transaction. See Note 3 for additional information. 
(3) Changes in goodwill due to acquisitions is related to Tracfone, Bluegrass and other insignificant transactions. See Note 3 for additional 
information. 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed quantitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business reporting units. Our 2021 
quantitative impairment assessments indicate that the fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their carrying 
values and therefore did not result in an impairment. We performed qualitative impairment assessments for our Consumer and Business 
reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our 
Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore did not result in impairment. 
We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our historical Media reporting unit in 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019, 
consistent with our accounting policy, we applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current 
assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that 
the fair value of the historical Media reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill 
impairment charge of approximately $186 million ($176 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019 in our consolidated statement of 
income. The goodwill balance of the historical Media reporting unit had been fully written off as a result of this impairment charge.

Note 6. Leasing Arrangements 
We enter into various lease arrangements for network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate and 
connectivity mediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our leases have remaining 
lease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to 25 years, and 
some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered into during the current period, we have concluded it 
is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease 
commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably 
certain that we will exercise that option. 
During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower 
acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We 
have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates in 2015, with options to 
renew. We continue to include the towers in Property, plant and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them 
accordingly. In addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, American Tower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases 
related to these towers. While American Tower can renegotiate the terms of and is responsible for paying the ground leases, we are still the 
primary obligor for these leases and accordingly, the present value of these ground leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use 
assets and operating lease liabilities. We do not expect to be required to make ground lease payments unless American Tower defaults, which 
we determined to be remote.

leases and small cell colocation and fiber operating leases that have not yet commenced. We have legally obligated lease payments for various 
other operating leases that have not yet commenced for which the total obligation was not significant. We have certain rights and obligations 
for these leases, but have not recognized an operating lease right-of-use asset or an operating lease liability since they have not yet 
commenced. 
Real Estate Transaction 
On July 23, 2019, Verizon completed a sale-leaseback transaction for buildings and real estate. We received total gross proceeds of 
approximately $1.0 billion. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction were classified in Other, net within Cash Flows from 
Investing Activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net gain as a result of this 
transaction is included in the components of net lease cost table above. This lease was included as part of the Media sale and has been 
assigned to the Apollo Affiliate.

debt obligations bore interest at a floating rate based on the Compounded Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for the interest 
period or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable interest margin per annum, as applicable. Compounded SOFR is 
calculated using the SOFR Index published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in accordance with the terms of the notes. The 
Compounded SOFR for the interest period ending in December 2021 was 0.049%. The one-month and three-month LIBOR at 
December 31, 2021 was 0.101% and 0.209%, respectively. 
(2) In November 2021, $141 million of 8.750% GTE LLC notes matured and were repaid. In November 2021, GTE LLC distributed its assets 
and liabilities to Verizon Communications and was dissolved. Verizon Communications is now the successor obligor on the remaining 
outstanding balance of $250 million.

During 
2021, we received $41.4 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $8.4 billion of proceeds from asset-backed 
debt transactions. The net proceeds were primarily used to finance the purchase of wireless licenses won in connection with the FCC's auction 
for C-Band wireless spectrum, Auction 107, and fund certain renewable energy projects. We used $18.9 billion of cash to repay, redeem and 
repurchase long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations, including $4.8 billion to prepay and repay asset-backed, long-term 
borrowings. The net proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion from the green bond issued in 2021 are expected to be used to fund certain 
renewable energy projects. 
During 2020, we received $31.5 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $5.6 billion of proceeds from asset-backed 
debt transactions. The net proceeds were a result of the liquidity strategy that we pursued at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to 
maintain a higher cash balance in order to further protect the Company against the economic uncertainties associated with the COVID-19

pandemic and to opportunistically raise cash to finance future obligations at a time when we believed that market conditions were favorable. 
We used $17.2 billion of cash to repay, redeem and repurchase long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations, including $7.4 billion to 
prepay and repay asset-backed, long-term borrowings. The net proceeds from the green bond issued in 2020 have been fully allocated to 
certain renewable energy projects.

the U.S. dollar, net proceeds are shown on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis. 
(2) An amount equal to the net proceeds from this green bond is expected to be used to fund, in whole or in part, certain renewable energy 
projects, including new and existing investments made by us during the period from December 1, 2020 through the maturity date of the 
green bond. 
(3) See Note 9 for additional information on derivative transactions related to the issuances. 
Commercial Paper Program 
In 2021, we issued and repaid $3.4 billion in commercial paper. As of December 31, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding. These 
transactions were recorded within Other, net cash flow from financing in our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Asset-Backed Debt 
As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $14.2 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes Asset-Backed Notes 
(ABS Notes) issued to third-party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities 
(collectively, the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively, the ABS 
Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under 
the terms of our asset-backed debt, Cellco Partnership (Cellco), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon, and certain other affiliates of Verizon 
(collectively, the Originators) transfer device payment plan agreement receivables to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such 
receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon entities retain the equity interests and residual interests, as applicable, in the 
ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related 
payments and expenses. 
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. 
The device payment plan agreement receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will 
only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers 
of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed debt transactions, and will not be available 
to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied. The 
Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any 
recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, Verizon has agreed to 
guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the ABS Entities. 
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain 
specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in 
Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash 
flows. The asset-backed debt issued and the assets securing this debt are included in our consolidated balance sheets.

Total $ 3,100 
Under the terms of each series of ABS Notes, there is a revolving period that is two years or up to three years, as applicable, during which we 
may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we made aggregate principal repayments of 
$3.3 billion on ABS Notes that have entered the amortization period, including principal payments made in connection with clean-up 
redemptions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we made aggregate principal repayments of $3.4 billion on ABS Notes that had 
entered the amortization period, including principal payments made in connection with clean-up redemptions. In January 2022, we made a 
principal payment of $179 million in connection with a clean-up redemption. 
In January 2022, we issued $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior and junior ABS Notes through an ABS Entity. 
ABS Financing Facilities 
In March 2021, we borrowed an additional $1.0 billion under the loan agreement outstanding in connection with the ABS Financing Facility 
that we originally entered into in 2016 and previously amended and restated in 2019 and 2020 (2020 ABS Financing Facility). In May 2021, 
the aggregate outstanding balance of $1.5 billion was fully repaid and there was no outstanding balance under the 2020 ABS Financing 
Facility as of December 31, 2021. 
In December 2021, we entered into an ABS financing facility with a number of financial institutions (2021 ABS Financing Facility). Two 
loan agreements were entered into in connection with the 2021 ABS Financing Facility in December 2021. Under the terms of the 2021 ABS 
Financing Facility, the financial institutions make advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement receivables 
of both Consumer customers and Business customers. Two loan agreements are outstanding in connection with the 2021 ABS Financing 
Facility, one with a final maturity date in December 2025 and the other in December 2026, and each loan agreement bears interest at floating 
rates. There is a one or two year revolving period, as set forth in the applicable loan agreement, which may be extended with the approval of 
the financial institutions. Under the loan agreements, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time without penalty, 
but in certain cases, with breakage costs. Subject to certain conditions, we may also remove receivables from the ABS Entity. In December 
2021, we borrowed $4.3 billion under the loan agreements. The aggregate outstanding balance under the 2021 ABS Financing Facility was 
$4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. In January 2022, we prepaid an aggregate of $515 million of the two loans outstanding under the 2021 
loan agreement. 
Variable Interest Entities 
The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary as we have both the power 
to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to 
receive benefits of the entity. Therefore, the assets, liabilities and activities of the ABS Entities are consolidated in our financial results and 
are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated balance sheets.

(1) The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to 
borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of 
credit. 
(2) During both 2021 and 2020, we drew down $1.0 billion from these facilities, respectively. These credit facilities are used to finance 
equipment-related purchases. Borrowings under certain of these facilities amortize semi-annually in equal installments up to the applicable 
maturity dates. Maturities reflect maturity dates of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and 
subsequently repaid cannot be reborrowed. 
In November 2021, we repaid $500 million under an export credit facility entered into in July 2017. 
Non-Cash Transactions 
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we financed, primarily through alternative financing arrangements, the purchase 
of approximately $461 million, $1.7 billion, and $563 million, respectively, of long-lived assets consisting primarily of network equipment. 
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, relating to these financing arrangements, including those 
entered into in prior years and liabilities assumed through acquisitions, remained outstanding. These purchases are non-cash financing 
activities and therefore are not reflected within Capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Debt Extinguishment Losses 
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded debt extinguishment losses of $3.6 billion, $121 million and 
$3.7 billion, respectively. The losses are recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. The total losses 
are reflected as an adjustment to reconcile net income to Net cash used in operating activities and the portion of the losses representing cash 
payments are reflected within Net cash used in financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Guarantees 
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, $765 million aggregate principal 
amount of these obligations remained outstanding. Each guarantee will remain in place for the life of the obligation unless terminated 
pursuant to its terms, including the operating telephone company no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. 
Debt Covenants 
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.

Accounts receivable, net of allowance $ 12,783 $ 4,742 $ 6,321 $ 23,846 
(1) Other receivables primarily include wireline receivables and other receivables, the allowances for which are individually insignificant. 
Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan 
agreement. Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program pay lower service fees as compared to 
those under our fixed-term service plans, and their device payment plan charge is included on their wireless monthly bill. We no longer offer 
Consumer customers new fixed-term, subsidized service plans for devices; however, we continue to offer subsidized plans to our Business 
customers. We also continue to service existing plans for customers who have not yet purchased and activated devices under the Verizon 
device payment program. 
Wireless Device Payment Plan Agreement Receivables

Device payment plan agreement receivables, net $ 20,186 $ 16,566 
(1) Includes allowance for both short-term and long-term device payment plan agreement receivables. 
Included in our device payment plan agreement receivables, net at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, are net device payment plan 
agreement receivables of $16.0 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, which have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be 
reported in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 for additional information. We believe the carrying value of these receivables 
approximate their fair value using a Level 3 expected cash flow model. 
For indirect channel wireless contracts with customers, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement receivables. 
We record the imputed interest as a reduction to the related accounts receivable. Interest income, which is included within Service revenues 
and other in our consolidated statements of income, is recognized over the financed device payment term. 
Promotions 
In connection with certain device payment plan agreements, we may offer a promotion to allow our customers to upgrade to a new device 
after paying down a certain specified portion of the required device payment plan agreement amount as well as trading in their device in good 
working order. When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to upgrade to a new device, we account for this 
trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. We recognize a liability measured at fair value for the customer’s right to trade in the device which is 
determined by considering several factors, including the weighted-average selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices eligible 
for trade-in. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the amount of the guarantee liability was $77 million and insignificant, 
respectively. 
We may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the purchase of a new device. Under 
these types of promotions, the customer receives a credit for the value of the trade-in device. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, 
the amount of trade-in liability was $366 million and $70 million, respectively. 
In addition, we may provide the customer with additional future billing credits that will be applied against the customer’s monthly bill as long 
as service is maintained. These future billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the 
determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability.

Origination of Device Payment Plan Agreements 
When originating device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk score to measure the credit 
quality of a customer and to determine eligibility for the device payment program. Verizon’s experience has been that the payment attributes 
of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future payments. Customers with longer tenures tend 
to exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and receivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to 
perform better than receivables from customers that have not previously been Verizon customers. As a result of this experience, we make 
initial lending decisions based upon whether the customers are "established customers" or "short-tenured customers." If a Consumer customer 
has been a customer for 45 days or more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12 months or more, the customer is considered an 
"established customer." For established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring processes rely on a combination of 
internal and external data sources. If a Consumer customer has been a customer less than 45 days, or a Business customer has been a customer 
for less than 12 months, the customer is considered a "short-tenured customer." For short-tenured customers, the credit decision and credit 
monitoring processes rely more heavily on external data sources. 
Internal data and/or external credit data are obtained from the credit reporting agencies, if available, to create a custom credit risk score for 
Consumer customers. The custom credit risk score is generated automatically from the applicant’s credit data using proprietary custom credit 
models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely delinquent and be disconnected for 
non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit report is not available from one of the national 
credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient credit history. In those instances, alternative credit data is 
used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify the existence of the business with external data sources. 
Based on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit. This includes an 
account level spending limit and a maximum amount of credit allowed per device for Consumer customers or a required down payment 
percentage for Business customers. 
Credit Quality Information 
Subsequent to origination, we assess indicators for the quality of our wireless device payment plan agreement portfolio using two models, one 
for new customers and one for existing customers. The model for new customers pools all Consumer and Business wireless customers based 
on less than 210 days as "new customers." The model for existing customers pools all Consumer and Business wireless customers based on 
210 days or more as "existing customers." 
The following table presents device payment plan agreement receivables, at amortized cost, as of December 31, 2021, by credit quality 
indicator and year of origination:

The data presented in the table above was last updated on December 31, 2021. 
We assess indicators for the quality of our wireless service receivables portfolio as one overall pool. As of December 31, 2021, wireless 
service receivables, at amortized cost, originating in 2021 and 2020 were $4.8 billion and an insignificant amount, respectively. 
Allowance for Credit Losses 
The credit quality indicators are used in determining the estimated amount and the timing of expected credit losses for the device payment 
plan agreement and wireless service receivables portfolios. 
For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss 
model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is 
assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary 
loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. 
We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and 
pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless 
service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month 
rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over 
the contractual life of the receivables and is adjusted based on the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on 
management’s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit 
losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable.

We monitor delinquency and write-off experience based on the quality of our device payment plan agreement and wireless service receivables 
portfolios. The extent of our collection efforts with respect to a particular customer are based on the results of our proprietary custom internal 
scoring models that analyze the customer’s past performance to predict the likelihood of the customer falling further delinquent. These 
custom scoring models assess a number of variables, including origination characteristics, customer account history and payment patterns. 
Since our customers’ behaviors may be impacted by general economic conditions, we analyzed whether changes in macroeconomic 
conditions impact our credit loss experience and have concluded that our credit loss estimates are generally not materially impacted by 
reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Based on the score derived from these models, accounts are grouped by 
risk category to determine the collection strategy to be applied to such accounts. For device payment plan agreement receivables and wireless 
service receivables, we consider an account to be delinquent and in default status if there are unpaid charges remaining on the account on the 
day after the bill’s due date. The risk class determines the speed and severity of the collections effort including initiatives taken to facilitate 
customer payment.

Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Certain of our equity investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are excluded from the tables above. Such investments are 
measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical 
or similar investment of the same issuer and are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. As 
of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values were 
$808 million and $402 million, respectively. During 2021, there were approximately $66 million of adjustments due to observable price 
changes and insignificant impairment charges. Cumulative adjustments due to observable price changes and impairment charges were 
approximately $143 million and $63 million, respectively. 
Verizon has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of Tracfone, completed in November 2021. The fair value is 
calculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model and represents a Level 3 measurement. Level 3 instruments include 
valuation based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other 
market participants. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting date, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair 
value with changes recorded within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. 
Fixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. The valuation of the fixed income securities are based on the 
quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or identical assets in inactive markets or models that apply inputs from observable market 
data. The valuation determines that these securities are classified as Level 2. 
Derivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative 
contracts and thus are classified within Level 2. We use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our 
derivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis. 
We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. 
Fair Value of Short-term and Long-term Debt 
The fair value of our debt is determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical debt instruments, which is a Level 1 
measurement, as well as quoted prices for similar debt instruments with comparable terms and maturities, which is a Level 2 measurement. 
The fair value of our short-term and long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was as follows:

Derivative Instruments 
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency 
swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold 
derivatives for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Swaps 
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable 
rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest 
rate risk exposure of designated debt issuances. We record the interest rate swaps at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and 
liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded to Interest expense, which are offset by changes in the fair value of 
the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates. 
In January 2022, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $500 million. 
The following amounts were recorded in Long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair 
value hedges:

Cross Currency Swaps 
We have entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, 
Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to 
mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A portion of the gains recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) 
was reclassified to Other income (expense), net to offset the related pre-tax foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying hedged 
item. See Note 14 for additional information. 
Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps 
We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to interest rate 
changes on future forecasted transactions. We hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows based on the expected maturities of 
the related forecasted debt issuance. We recognize gains and losses resulting from interest rate movements in Other comprehensive income 
(loss). 
86
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
Treasury Rate Locks 
We enter into treasury rate locks to mitigate our interest rate risk. We recognize gains and losses resulting from interest rate movements in 
Other comprehensive income (loss). 
Net Investment Hedges 
We have designated certain foreign currency debt instruments as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-
U.S. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. In March 2021, we de-designated the 
existing net investment hedge and designated a new net investment hedge using a different Euro-denominated note. The notional amount of 
Euro-denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge was €750 million as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
Undesignated Derivatives 
We also have the following derivative contracts which we use as economic hedges but for which we have elected not to apply hedge 
accounting.

Treasury Rate Locks 
We enter into treasury rate locks to mitigate our interest rate risk. 
Swaptions 
We enter into swaptions to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. 
In January 2022, we sold payer swaptions with a notional amount of $1.0 billion to enter into future pay-floating interest rate swaps indexed 
to SOFR that were not designated in hedging relationships. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, short-term and long-
term investments, trade receivables, including device payment plan agreement receivables, certain notes receivable, including lease 
receivables, and derivative contracts. 
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA 
master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. The CSA agreements contain 
rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding 
positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative 
instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from 
derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December 31, 2021, we held and posted $0.1 billion and an insignificant amount, 
respectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange agreements, which were recorded as Other current 
liabilities and Prepaid expenses and other, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, we held $0.2 billion of 
collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Other current liabilities in our 
consolidated balance sheet. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk 
87
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
due to our diversified pool of counterparties. 
Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation 
Verizon Long-Term Incentive Plan 
In May 2017, Verizon’s shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated Verizon's authority to 
grant new awards under the Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants 
to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted 
stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, Verizon reserved for issuance 
under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under 
the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 
2021, 76 million shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan. 
Restricted Stock Units 
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. 
The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon 
common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as liability awards 
and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend 
equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time 
the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In 2020, Verizon announced a broad-based program that provides for 
the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan to all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements on the 
annual grant date. 
We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 
We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated 
forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
Performance Stock Units 
The 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As 
defined by the 2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns 
based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs that 
are paid in stock upon vesting and are classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and 
are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The PSUs that are settled in cash and are classified as liability awards are measured at 
its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Verizon common stock as well as 
performance relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to 
participants if, and only to the extent the applicable PSU award vests, and is paid at the time that PSU award is paid, and in the same 
proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance goals achieved. 
The following table summarizes Verizon’s Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Stock Unit activity:

As of December 31, 2021, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’s RSUs and PSUs was 
approximately $773 million and is expected to be recognized over approximately 2 years. 
The equity awards granted in 2021 and 2020 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $55.39 and $57.38 per unit, respectively. During 
2021, 2020 and 2019, we paid $986 million, $961 million and $737 million, respectively, to settle RSUs and PSUs classified as liability 
awards.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
After-tax compensation expense for stock-based compensation related to RSUs and PSUs described above included in Net income attributable 
to Verizon was $625 million, $780 million and $872 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Note 11. Employee Benefits 
We maintain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans for certain employees. In addition, we maintain postretirement health care and 
life insurance plans for certain retirees and their dependents, which are both contributory and non-contributory, and include a limit on our 
share of the cost for certain current and future retirees. In accordance with our accounting policy for pension and other postretirement 
benefits, operating expenses include service costs associated with pension and other postretirement benefits while other credits and/or charges 
based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates, an estimated return on plan assets, and impact from health care trend rates 
are reported in Other income (expense), net. These estimates are updated in the fourth quarter to reflect actual return on plan assets and 
updated actuarial assumptions or upon a remeasurement event. The adjustment is recognized in the income statement during the fourth quarter 
or upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses. 
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
Pension and other postretirement benefits for certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Modifications in benefits 
have been bargained from time to time, and we may also periodically amend the benefits in the management plans. The following tables 
summarize benefit costs, as well as the benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status and rate assumptions associated with pension and 
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $20.1 billion and $22.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively. 
Actuarial gain/loss, Net 
The net actuarial gain in 2021 is primarily the result of a $1.1 billion gain due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine 
the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020 to a 
weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021. 
The net actuarial loss in 2020 is primarily the result of a $3.2 billion loss due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine 
the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 3.3% at December 31, 2019 to a 
weighted-average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020. 
Plan Amendments 
The reclassifications from the amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a result of collective bargaining 
agreements and plan amendments made in 2016, 2017 and 2018 resulted in a net decrease to net periodic benefit cost and net increase to pre-
tax income of approximately $708 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019.

In determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 2.9% in 2021. The rates 
were selected to approximate the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at 
December 31, 2021. The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the time periods during which benefits payments are expected to 
occur, were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $300 million par outstanding). 
In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each major asset 
class over the subsequent 10-year period. Those estimates are based on a combination of factors including the current market interest rates 
and valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and historical long-term risk premiums. To determine the aggregate return for the 
pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset class is then weighted according to the allocation to that investment area in the 
trust’s long-term asset allocation policy. 
The assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows: 
Health Care and Life 
At December 31, 2021 2020 2019 
Weighted-average healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year  6.20 %  6.20 %  6.30 % 
Rate to which cost trend rate gradually declines  4.50  4.50  4.50 
Year the rate reaches the level it is assumed to remain thereafter 2029 2029 2027 
Plan Assets 
The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into 
consideration risk and return. While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed 
so that 45% to 55% of the assets have the objective of achieving a return in excess of the growth in liabilities (comprised of public equities, 
private equities, real estate, hedge funds, high yield bonds and emerging market debt) and 44% to 54% of the assets are invested as liability 
hedging assets (where interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability) and a 
maximum of 10% is in cash. This allocation will shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target 
policies will be revisited periodically to ensure they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used 
depending on perceived market efficiencies and various other factors. Due to our diversification and risk control processes, there are no 
significant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector, industry, geography or company names.

The following are general descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies and inputs used to determine the fair value 
of each major category of assets. 
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds (less than 90 days to maturity), primarily in diversified portfolios of 
investment grade money market instruments and are valued using quoted market prices or other valuation methods. The carrying value of 
cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. 
Investments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the 
last business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds, 
international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-
counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published 
sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes. 
Commingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). 
Commingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund 
managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan. 
The investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership investments. Real 
estate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment 
manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance 
or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are based upon available and current market 
information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, 
estimated fair values might differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These 
differences could be material. 
Forward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last 
business day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified 
by the asset class of the underlying holdings. 
Hedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager. These funds are valued in 
accordance with the terms of their corresponding offering or private placement memoranda. 
Commingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate limited partnership investments for which
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
fair value is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy but are included in total 
investments. 
Employer Contributions 
In 2021, we made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans, $58 million of contributions to our nonqualified pension plans 
and $885 million of contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans. No qualified pension plans contributions are expected to be made 
in 2022. Nonqualified pension plans contributions are estimated to be approximately $60 million and contributions to our other postretirement 
benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $860 million in 2022. 
Estimated Future Benefit Payments 
The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows: 
(dollars in millions) 
Year Pension Benefits Health Care and Life 
2022 $ 2,049 $ 906 
2023 1,648 883 
2024 1,097 862 
2025 1,066 850 
2026 1,034 840 
2027 to 2031 5,097 4,139 
Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans 
We maintain four leveraged employee stock ownership plans (ESOP). We match a certain percentage of eligible employee contributions to 
certain savings plans with shares of our common stock from this ESOP. At December 31, 2021, the number of allocated shares of common 
stock in this ESOP was 44 million. There were no unallocated shares of common stock in this ESOP at December 31, 2021. All leveraged 
ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations. 
Total savings plan costs were $690 million in 2021, $730 million in 2020 and $897 million in 2019.

Severance, Pension and Benefits (Credits) Charges 
During 2021, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur, we recorded 
net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.4 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The credits were recorded in Other 
income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a credit of $1.1 billion due to an increase in our 
discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-
average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020 to a weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021, a credit of $847 million due to the difference 
between our estimated and our actual return on assets and a credit of $453 million due to other actuarial assumption adjustments. During 
2021, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $233 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated 
statements of income. 
During 2020, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits charges of $1.6 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The 
charges were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a charge of 
$3.2 billion due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and 
postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 3.3% at December 31, 2019 to a weighted-average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020, 
partially offset by a credit of $1.6 billion due to the difference between our estimated and our actual return on assets. During 2020, we also 
recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $309 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of 
income. 
During 2019, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits charges of $126 million in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The 
charges were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a charge of 
$4.3 billion due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and 
postretirement benefits plans from a weighted-average of 4.4% at December 31, 2018 to a weighted-average of 3.3% at December 31, 2019, 
partially offset by a credit of $2.3 billion due to the difference between our estimated return on assets and our actual return on assets and a 
94
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
credit of $1.9 billion due to other assumption adjustments, of which $1.6 billion related to healthcare claims experience. During 2019, we also 
recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $260 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of 
income.

Other, net  (0.2)  (0.3)  0.1 
Effective income tax rate  23.1 %  23.4 %  13.0 % 
The effective income tax rate for 2021 was 23.1% compared to 23.4% for 2020. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily 
due to the sale of Verizon Media in the current period, partially offset by the non-recurring tax benefit recognized in 2020 from a series of 
legal entity restructurings. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes in 
the current period. 
The effective income tax rate for 2020 was 23.4% compared to 13.0% for 2019. The increase in the effective income tax rate and the 
provision for income taxes was primarily due to the recognition of a $2.2 billion tax benefit in connection with the disposition of preferred 
stock representing a minority interest in a foreign affiliate in 2019 that did not reoccur in 2020. 
The amounts of cash taxes paid by Verizon are as follows:

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 
Deferred taxes arise because of differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Significant components of deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are as follows:

Other - liabilities 8,041 6,867 
Deferred tax liabilities 52,869 47,602 
Net deferred tax liability $ 40,517 $ 35,623 
At December 31, 2021, undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. amounted to approximately 
$5.5 billion. The majority of Verizon's cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent on foreign cash or earnings 
to meet our funding requirements, nor do we intend to repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations. Furthermore, a 
portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that legally must be kept in reserve in accordance with certain foreign 
jurisdictional requirements and are unavailable for distribution or repatriation. As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on these 
undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and therefore unavailable for use in 
funding U.S. operations. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not 
practicable. 
At December 31, 2021, we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $2.2 billion that 
primarily relate to state and foreign taxes. Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $1.7 billion will expire between 
2022 and 2041 and approximately $554 million may be carried forward indefinitely. 
During 2021, the valuation allowance decreased approximately $609 million primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media. The $1.6 billion 
valuation allowance at December 31, 2021, is primarily related to state and foreign net operating losses and credits.

The increase in unrecognized tax benefits was primarily related to the acquisition of Tracfone, and was partially offset by the resolution of 
issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) involving tax years 2013-2014 as well as lapses of statutes of limitations in various 
jurisdictions. The uncertain tax benefits related to the acquisition of Tracfone involve pre-acquisition tax matters and are the subject of an 
indemnity from América Móvil for which a corresponding indemnity asset has been established. 
Verizon and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a 
large taxpayer, we are under audit by the IRS and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years. The IRS is currently 
examining the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2015-2018 and Cellco's U.S. income tax return for tax years 2017-2018. Tax 
controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2006. The amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 
twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that various current tax 
examinations will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the 
possible change cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved. 
Note 13. Segment Information 
Reportable Segments 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. We measure and evaluate 
our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment 
performance. 
Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following: 
Segment Description 
Verizon 
Consumer Group Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. 
Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. under the Verizon 
brand and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband 
through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern 
U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and 
over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. 
Verizon 
Business Group Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video 
and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long 
distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We also provide FWA 
broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government 
customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the 
world. 
Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase 
wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by 
the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings: Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and 
Wholesale. 
Corporate and other primarily includes insurance captives, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that 
support our strategic initiatives, as well as unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee benefit related costs and 
interest and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses including Verizon Media, and 
other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions 
are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions 
that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker’s 
assessment of segment performance. 
We completed the sale of Verizon Media on September 1, 2021. See Note 3 for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media. 
The reconciliation of segment operating revenues and expenses to consolidated operating revenues and expenses below includes the effects of 
special items that the chief operating decision maker does not consider in assessing segment performance, primarily because of their nature.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
International operating revenues were not significant during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2021 
and 2020, international long-lived assets were not significant. 
The chief operating decision maker does not review disaggregated assets on a segment basis; therefore, such information is not presented. 
Depreciation included in the measure of segment profitability is primarily allocated based on proportional usage. 
Note 14. Equity and Comprehensive Income 
Equity 
In December 2019, 46,100 preferred shares of a foreign affiliate of Verizon was sold for cash consideration of $51 million and is reflected in 
non-controlling interests. The preferred shares pay cumulative dividends of 8.25% per annum. 
Common Stock 
In February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Verizon's 
common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase 
plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Verizon did 
not repurchase any shares of Verizon’s common stock under our current or previously authorized share buyback programs. At December 31, 
2021, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million. 
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the 
years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we issued 2.1 million, 2.3 million and 3.8 million common shares from treasury stock, 
respectively, which had an insignificant aggregate value. 
In connection with our acquisition of Tracfone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6 million shares of Verizon common shares 
from treasury stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion. See Note 3 for additional information. 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net 
income. Significant changes in the components of Other comprehensive loss, net of provision for income taxes are described below.

Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies 
In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal 
level. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a 
given matter, the Company establishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of 
the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors 
typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; 
(3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party 
and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not
102
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on our financial 
condition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations for a given reporting period. 
Verizon is currently involved in approximately 20 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. Most of 
these cases are brought by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary damages; a small number are brought by companies that 
have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well. These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial 
in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. 
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and 
warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as 
indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and Verizon will seek to 
defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business. 
Subsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was 
issued when the directory business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensions). The preexisting guarantee continues, 
without modification, despite the subsequent sale of Verizon Information Services Canada and the spin-off of our domestic print and internet 
yellow pages directories business. The possible financial impact of the guarantee, which is not expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably 
estimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may offset each 
other. We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely. 
As of December 31, 2021, letters of credit totaling approximately $674 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and 
support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. 
During 2021, Verizon entered into seven renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 13 signed in 
previous years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term of 
12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation, which is expected to occur through 2024, as 
applicable. The REPAs generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the 
facilities. 
We have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and 
legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of one year, total $29.8 billion, 
and primarily represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, content, marketing services and other items 
which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $10.2 billion is attributable to 
2022, $8.7 billion is attributable to 2023, $5.6 billion is attributable to 2024, $4.2 billion is attributable to 2025, $482 million is attributable to 
2026 and $641 million is attributable to years thereafter. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but 
represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the 
noncancelable quantities to which we are contractually obliged. Since the commitments to purchase programming services from television 
networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at 
December 31, 2021, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed 
with no firm commitment. 
Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
None. 
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this 
Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, 
summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal control established in Internal Control– 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, 
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective 
as of December 31, 2021. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our 
systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, we began a multi-
year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of our existing core financial 
systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data analysis and accelerate information 
reporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.
103
Verizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
As the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, 
could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such 
changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2021 that have materially affected, 
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
The management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial 
reporting of the company. Management has evaluated internal control over financial reporting of the company using the criteria for effective 
internal control established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission in 2013. 
In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their 
first assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition. Based on those guidelines, management's 
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), which 
the Company acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 
Company's acquisition of Tracfone. We have included the financial results of this acquisition in the consolidated financial statements from the 
date of acquisition. Tracfone represented approximately 3% of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2021, and less than 1% of 
consolidated total revenues for the year then ended. 
Management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Based on this 
assessment, management believes that the internal control over financial reporting of the company is effective as of December 31, 2021. In 
connection with this assessment, there were no material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting identified by 
management. The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has provided an attestation report on the 
company’s internal control over financial reporting and is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
