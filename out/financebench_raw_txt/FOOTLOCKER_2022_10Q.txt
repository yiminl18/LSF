CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts. They often include words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipate s,” “estimates,” “intends,”
“plans,” “seeks,” “continues,” “feels,” “forecasts,”  or words of similar meaning, or future or condit ional verbs, such as “will,”
“should,” “could,” “may ,” “aims,” “intends,” or “projects.” Statements may be forward looking even in the absence of these
particular words.
Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regardi ng our financial position,
business strategy , and other plans and objecti ves for our future operations, and generation of free cash flow. These
forward-looking stateme nts are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their
potential effect on us. The forward-looking statements contained herein are largely based on our expectations for the
future, which reflect certain estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and assumptions
reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions, operating trends, and other factors. Although we
believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and
uncertainties that are beyond our control. As such, management’ s assumptions about future events may prove to be
inaccurate.
We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events,
changes in circumstances, or otherwise. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to
us, or persons acting on our behalf. Management cautions you that the forward-looking statements contained herein are
not guarante es of future performance, and we cannot assure you that such statements will be realized or that the events
and circumstances they describe will occur . Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements herein include, but are not limited to, a change in the relationship
with any of our key suppliers, including the unavailability of premium products at competitive prices, volume discounts,
cooperative advertising, markdown allowances, or ability to cancel orders and return merchandise; our ability to fund our
planned capital investments; volatility in the financial markets or other global economic factors; difficulties in appropriately
allocating capital and resources among our strategic opportunities; our ability to realize the expected benefits from
acquisitions; business opportunities and expansion; investments; expenses; dividends; share repurchases; liquidity; cash
flow from operations; use of cash and cash requirements; borrowing capacity; repatriation of cash to the United States;
supply chain issues, including delays in merchandise receipts and increasing cost pressure caused by higher oceanic
shipping and freight costs; labor shortages; expectations regarding increased wages; inflation; consumer spending levels;
the effect of governmental assistance programs; social unrest; continuing risks relating to the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, including vaccines and safety protocols; expectations regarding increasing global taxes; the effect of increased
government regulation and changes in law; the effect of the adverse outcome of any material litigation against us or judicial
decisions that affect us or our industry generally; the effects of weather; climate change; ESG risks; increased competition;
geopolitical events; the financial effect of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; credit risk relating to the
risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties; and any other factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk
Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary
statement. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those
future events or circumstances may not occur . You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which
speak to our views only as of the date of this filing. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about
or that we currently consider to be insignificant may also af fect our business operations and financial performance.
Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission for a discussion of certain risks relating to our business and any investme nt in our securities. Given
these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of actual results. Any or all
of the forward-looking statements contained in this report, or any other public statement made by us, including by our
management, may turn out to be incorrect. We are including this cautionary note to make applica ble and take advantage of
the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. We
expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events, or otherwise.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 6
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited. In the
opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal, recurring
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. As used in these
Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the terms “Foot Locker,” “Company,”
“we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Foot Locker, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes and related disclosures. Actual
results may differ from those estimates. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily
indicative of the results expected for the year.
The results of operations for the period ended October 29, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for the full fiscal year due to the continued uncertainty of general economic conditions that may
affect us for the remainder of 2022.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2021 Form 10-K.
There were no significant changes to the policies disclosed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies of our 2021 Form 10-K.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material
effect on our present or future consolidated financial statements.
2. Acquisitions
In 2021, we acquired WSS and atmos, two businesses that will allow us to further differentiate our product
offerings, as well as our customer base, and diversify our retail store and omnichannel portfolio.
WSS
During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, we paid an additional $4 million upon the finalization of
the value of net assets acquired, with a corresponding increase to goodwill as compared with the amounts
presented in the most recent annual report. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition has increased to
$811 million ($741 million, net of cash acquired). During the third quarter of 2022, we recorded changes to the
value of net assets acquired related to income tax balances.

atmos
During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, we paid an additional $6 million and
$14 million, respectively, in connection with the finalization of certain post-closing conditions. The aggregate
purchase price for the acquisition has increased to $374 million, subject to additional adjustments for the
finalization of the value of net assets acquired and other post-closing matters. The preliminary purchase price
includes contingent consideration initially measured at $35 million, which can reach up to $111 million based on
achieving certain revenue growth and EBITDA performance targets. The fair value of the contingent
consideration has not changed from the initial measurement. The preliminary purchase price does not yet
reflect the finalization of the net working capital provisions and other post-closing adjustments. At closing, we
placed $30 million in escrow, of which $10 million related to net working capital adjustments and $20 million
related to certain indemnifications. The net working capital adjustment will be finalized during the fourth quarter
and the indemnification escrow will be released in May 2023, unless there is a pending claim.
The following table represents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for atmos and includes fair value
adjustments to certain assets and liabilities since our most recent annual report. Changes to amounts reported
at year end included a $14 million increase in goodwill due to the additional purchase price, a $5 million
downward valuation of intangible assets, and other changes of $2 million. These adjustments did not have a
significant effect on the consolidated results of operations. We determined that the atmos tradenames will have
an indefinite life and will not be amortized.
We are assessing the tax deductibility of the goodwill related to the acquisition.

Contract Liabilities
We sell gift cards, which do not have expiration dates. Revenue from gift card sales is recorded when the gift
cards are redeemed by customers. Breakage income is recognized as revenue in proportion to the pattern of
rights exercised by the customer. The table below presents the activity of our gift card liability balance.

4. Segment Information
We have integrated all available shopping channels including stores, websites, apps, and social channels. Store
sales are primarily fulfilled from the store’s inventory, but may also be shipped from any of our distribution
centers or from a different store location if an item is not available at the original store. Direct-to-customer
orders are generally shipped to our customers through our distribution centers but may also be shipped from
any store or a combination of our distribution centers and stores depending on availability.
We evaluate performance based on several factors, primarily the banner’s financial results, referred to as
division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other charges, corporate
expense, non-operating income, and net interest expense.

Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $5 million related to long-lived assets and right-of-use assets,
as well as accelerated tenancy charges for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022.
For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021 we recorded $13 million and $52 million of
impairment charges related to the decision to exit the Footaction banner, respectively. Impairment of
investments was $30 million and $32 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021,
respectively, due to continued losses and updated estimates of value. In connection with the acquisitions, we
recorded costs of $14 million, for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021. We recorded
charges of $4 million in lease-related termination costs, and a severance charge of $2 million in connection with
the reorganization of certain support functions, offset by $7 million of insurance recovery income related to 2020
social unrest losses for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021.
6. Other Income / (Expense), net
Effective June 27, 2022, the Company reached a definitive agreement to sell all assets related to the Eastbay
Team Sales business, consisting primarily of inventory and accounts receivable. During the second quarter, we
received proceeds of $47 million from the transaction. During the third quarter we finalized the net assets sold
to purchasers increasing the gain to $19 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022.

7. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash (continued)
Amounts included in restricted cash primarily relate to amounts held in escrow in connection with various
leasing arrangements in Europe and deposits held in insurance trusts to satisfy the requirement to collateralize
part of the self-insured workers’ compensation and liability claims.
8. Goodwill
See footnote 2, Acquisitions, for additional information on our recent acquisitions.
In conjunction with the sale of the Eastbay Team Sales business, we allocated $6 million of goodwill to the
assets sold, representing the allocable share of the fair value of the reporting unit disposed of.
We review goodwill for impairment annually during the first quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if
impairment indicators arise. The review of impairment consists of either using a qualitative approach to
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying
values or a one-step quantitative impairment test. The results of the first quarter analysis did not result in an
impairment since the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

(2)During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge related to the Footaction tradename.  
In connection with the acquisitions of WSS and atmos, we recognized indefinite life intangible assets of
$296 million for WSS related tradenames and $130 million for atmos related tradenames. Additionally, we
recognized customer list intangible assets of $13 million for WSS and $9 million for atmos, both of which will be
amortized over 3 years. The intangibles related to atmos were originally recorded at the exchange rate in effect
as of the date of acquisition and are presented in the above table at current period exchange rates. Amortizing
intangible assets primarily represent the WSS and atmos customer lists, and lease acquisition costs, which are
amounts that are required to secure prime lease locations and other lease rights, primarily in Europe.

11. Financial Instruments and Risk Management
Fair Value Hedge
On May 6, 2022, we entered into a cross-currency swap contract to reduce the effect of the fluctuating U.S.
Dollar (“USD”) to Japanese Yen (“JPY”) foreign exchange rate on our foreign currency-denominated
intercompany loan between our Japanese and U.S. subsidiary. We expect the gains and losses on this contract
to offset losses and gains on the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from
the remeasurement of the principal and interest accrued on the loan. Though the intercompany loan eliminates
in consolidation, the foreign currency remeasurement of the loan and interest by the U.S. subsidiary is reflected
in the consolidated financial statements.
The cross-currency swap contract has a notional amount of JPY 11 billion and final receipt of $85 million. The
cross-currency swap contract, which matures on November 2, 2031, swaps Yen-denominated interest
payments for U.S. dollar-denominated interest payments, thereby economically converting the JPY 11 billion
fixed-rate 3.51% intercompany loan to a fixed-rate 6.77% USD-denominated receivable for our U.S. subsidiary.
We designated the cross-currency swap contract to hedge the changes in value of the intercompany loan and
its variability on earnings. We will apply fair value hedge accounting, and we will consider market factors other
than the change in the spot exchange rate on the notional amount of the swap to be excluded components. The
foreign currency spot rate fluctuations on the cross-currency swap notional amount and interest accruals are
reported in earnings each period, while all other changes are reported in other comprehensive income. Because
the terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument match and the likelihood of swap counterparty default
is not probable, the hedge is expected to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the foreign currency debt
resulting from to foreign currency fluctuations over the term of the swap.
As of October 29, 2022, the cross-currency swap had a fair value of $4 million and was included in other assets.
We record the changes in the fair value of the contract to AOCL. Each period, we reclassify an amount out of
AOCL equal to the remeasurement gain or loss on the hedged intercompany loan that is recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses. As of October 29, 2022, there was $4 million in AOCL, net of tax, related
to the cross-currency swap. In addition, we recognize swap interest income based on the differential in fixed
interest rates per the contract. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, we recorded
$1 million and $2 million of income in interest expense, net, respectively. Refer to Note 10 for further information
regarding amounts recorded in AOCL.

12. Fair Value Measurements
Our financial assets are recorded at fair value, using a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are categorized as follows:
Level 1 –Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 –Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for
similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or
significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.
Level 3 –Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are
unobservable.
In 2021, we invested $68 million to take a common stock minority stake in a public entity, Retailors, Ltd, which is
traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. This investment is classified as a Level 1 instrument since the fair value
is readily available in an active market.
The fair value of the auction rate security, classified as available-for-sale, is determined by using quoted prices
for similar instruments in active markets and accordingly is classified as a Level 2 instrument.
The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the atmos acquisition is estimated using
an option pricing model simulation that determines an average projected payment value across numerous
iterations.
Our derivative financial instruments are valued using market-based inputs to valuation models. These valuation
models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of
volatility and, therefore, are classified as Level 2 instruments.

12. Fair Value Measurements (continued)
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a
nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets,
goodwill, other intangible assets, and minority investments that are not accounted for under the equity method
of accounting. These assets are measured using Level 3 inputs, if determined to be impaired. Minority
investments measured using the fair value measurement alternative had a carrying value of $579 million and
$618 million as of October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, respectively.
Long-Term Debt
The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs
or significant value drivers are observable in active markets and, therefore, are classified as Level 2. The
balance as of October 29, 2022 includes the $400 million 4% Notes. The carrying value and estimated fair value
of long-term debt were as follows:
($ in millions)     October 29, 2022    October 30, 2021
Carrying value (1) $ 395 $ 492
Fair value $ 308 $ 497
(1)The carrying value of debt as of October 29, 2022 reflects $5 million of issuer’s discount and costs related to the 4% Notes.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, and other current receivables and payables approximate
their fair value.
13. Earnings Per Share
We account for earnings per share (“EPS”) using the treasury stock method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing
net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding at the end of the
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the period used in the basic EPS computation plus dilutive common stock equivalents. The computation of
diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that
would have an anti-dilutive effect on EPS. The computation of basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units
Restricted stock units (“RSU”) are awarded to certain officers, key employees of the Company, and
nonemployee directors. Additionally, performance stock units (“PSU”) are awarded to officers and certain key
employees in connection with our long-term incentive program. Each RSU and PSU represents the right to
receive one share of our common stock provided that the applicable performance and vesting conditions are
satisfied. PSU awards granted in 2022 also include a performance objective based on our relative total
shareholder return over the performance period to a pre-determined peer group, assuming the reinvestment of
dividends. The fair value of these awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the date of the
grant and share-based compensation expense will not be adjusted should the target awards vary from actual
awards.

15. Share-Based Compensation (continued)
Generally, RSU awards fully vest after the passage of time, typically three years for employees and one year for
nonemployee directors, provided there is continued service with the Company until the vesting date, subject to
the terms of the award. PSU awards are earned only after the attainment of performance goals in connection
with the relevant performance period and vest after an additional one-year period. No dividends are paid or
accumulated on any RSU or PSU awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period.
RSU and PSU activity for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022 is summarized as follows:
Weighted-Average
Number Remaining Weighted-Average
of Contractual Grant Date
Shares Life Fair Value
    (in thousands)    (in years)    (per share)
Nonvested at beginning of year  1,391 $ 43.95

Forfeited  (314)  32.89
Nonvested at October 29, 2022  2,146 1.6 $ 37.15
Aggregate value ($ in millions) $ 80    
(1)This represents adjustments made to PSUs reflecting changes in estimates based upon our current performance against predefined
financial targets.  
The total value of RSU and PSU awards that vested during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022 and
October 30, 2021 was $6 million and $23 million, respectively. As of October 29, 2022, there was $37 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards.
16. Legal Proceedings
Legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries consist of ordinary, routine
litigation, including administrative proceedings, incidental to the business of the Company or businesses that
have been sold or discontinued by the Company in past years. These legal proceedings include commercial,
intellectual property, customer, environmental, and employment-related claims. Additionally, the Company is a
defendant in a purported wage/hour and wage statement violation class action in California.
We do not believe that the outcome of any such legal proceedings pending against the Company or its
consolidated subsidiaries, as described above, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole, based upon current knowledge and taking
into consideration current accruals. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Judgments could be rendered or
settlements made that could adversely affect the Company’s operating results or cash flows in a particular
period.
17. Subsequent Events
Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its shares in
Retailors, Ltd. at a discount to the publicly traded value. We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately
$84 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 20Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Business Overview
Foot Locker, Inc. leads the celebration of sneaker and youth culture around the globe through a portfolio of
brands including Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Eastbay, atmos, WSS,
Footaction, and Sidestep. As of October 29, 2022, we operated 2,794 primarily mall-based stores, as well as
stores in high-traffic urban retail areas and high streets, in 28 countries across the United States, Canada,
Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, as well as websites and mobile apps. Our purpose is to inspire and
empower youth culture around the world, by fueling a shared passion for self-expression and creating unrivaled
experiences at the heart of the global sneaker community.
We use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores, including order-in-store,
buy online and pickup-in-store, and buy online and ship-from-store, as well as e-commerce. We operate
websites and mobile apps aligned with the brand names of our store banners including footlocker.com,
kidsfootlocker.com, champssports.com, atmosusa.com, shopwss.com and related e-commerce sites in the
various international countries that we operate. These sites offer some of the largest online product selections
and provide a seamless link between e-commerce and physical stores. We also operate the website for
eastbay.com.
Store Count
At October 29, 2022, we operated 2,794 stores as compared with 2,858 and 2,956 stores at January 29, 2022
and October 30, 2021, respectively.
Franchise Operations
A total of 155 franchised stores were operating at October 29, 2022, as compared with 142 and 136 stores at
January 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, respectively, operating in the Middle East and Asia. Revenue from
franchised stores was not significant for any of the periods presented. These stores are not included in the
operating store count above.
Leadership Transition
As part of a planned succession process, Richard A. Johnson retired as President and Chief Executive Officer,
effective September 1, 2022. Mary N. Dillon, former Executive Chair and CEO of Ulta Beauty, Inc., was
appointed President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Foot Locker Board, also effective
September 1, 2022.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures
In addition to reporting our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”), we report certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. We have presented
certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP, such as sales changes excluding foreign currency
fluctuations, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per
share.
We present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered
non-GAAP measures. Where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations,
such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign
exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables
them to better understand the changes in our business that are not related to currency movements.
Table of Contents
Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 21These non-GAAP measures are presented because we believe they assist investors in comparing our
performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are
indicative of our core business or affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in
assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives. We estimate the tax effect of all non-
GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal tax rate to each item. The income tax items represent the discrete
amount that affected the period. The non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition, and not as an
alternative, to our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Effective with the first quarter of 2022, the calculation for non-GAAP earnings excludes gains and losses from
all minority investments, including the adjustments related to the investment in Retailors, Ltd. We believe this is
a more representative measure of our recurring earnings, assists in the comparability of results, and is
consistent with how management reviews performance. The non-GAAP results for 2021 have been recast, as
applicable, to conform to the current year’s presentation. As we report quarterly results through 2022, we will
provide updated non-GAAP reconciliations for the corresponding prior year’s quarter under this revised
definition.
Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP.

Table of Contents
Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 22The adjustments made to other income / (expense), net reflect gains or losses primarily associated with our
minority investments. See the Other Income / (Expense), net section for further information.
In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded a $5 million charge related to our income tax reserves due to the
resolution of a foreign tax settlement.
Segment Reporting
We have determined that we have three operating segments, North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Our
North America operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in the U.S. and
Canada: Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and Footaction, including
each of their related e-commerce businesses, as well as our Eastbay business. Our EMEA operating segment
includes the results of the following banners operating in Europe: Foot Locker, Sidestep, and Kids Foot Locker,
including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our Asia Pacific operating segment includes the results
of the Foot Locker banner and its related e-commerce business operating in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia,
as well as atmos, which operates primarily in Asia. We have further aggregated these operating segments into
one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.
Results of Operations
We evaluate performance based on several factors, primarily the banner’s financial results, referred to as
division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other charges, corporate
expenses, non-operating income, and net interest expense.
The table below summarizes our results.

Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 23Sales
All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales of stores that were open at the
period-end and had been open for more than one year. The computation of consolidated comparable sales also
includes our direct-to-customers channel. Stores opened or closed during the period are not included in the
comparable-store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Stores
that were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic are also included in the computation of
comparable-store sales. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
Sales from acquired businesses that include inventory are included in the computation of comparable-store
sales after 15 months of operations. Accordingly, sales of WSS and atmos have been excluded from the
computation of comparable-store sales. As a result of the Eastbay Team Sales divestiture, sales from this
business were removed for the computation of comparable sales for all periods.
For the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2022, total sales decreased by $16 million, or 0.7%, to $2,173 million,
as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, total
sales decreased by $204 million, or 3.1%, to $6,413 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year
period. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total sales increased by $72 million, or 3.3%, for the
thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2022, and decreased by $4 million, or 0.1%, for the thirty-nine weeks ended
October 29, 2022. Comparable sales increased by 0.8% and decreased by 3.9% for the thirteen and thirty-nine
weeks ended October 29, 2022, respectively. The information shown below represents certain sales metrics by
sales channel.

Table of Contents
Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 24Despite the decline in sales as compared with our record levels in 2021, sales exceeded the results of 2019.
Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and our acquisitions, sales increased by 4.5% and by
2.2% for the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as compared with the corresponding periods of
2019.
Comparable sales increased in our stores, however sales decreased in our direct-to-customer channel for the
quarter and year-to-date periods of 2022. Our sales in stores increased, driven by strong demand, brand
diversification efforts, and improved access to high-quality inventory. Our direct-to-customer channel continued
to decrease as shoppers navigated back to physical locations.
Our North American operating segment’s sales, excluding WSS, and comparable-store sales for the current
year were negatively affected by the significant fiscal stimulus, which contributed to last year’s growth, as well
as the effects of inflation on customer demand. Additionally, the wind down of the Footaction business
negatively affected sales, last year we operated 161 stores as compared with 11 this quarter. Within EMEA,
sales from the Foot Locker banner increased as tourism returned to more historical levels driving traffic back to
our stores. The overall positive comparable sales for EMEA was partly offset by continued decline in sales from
the Sidestep banner, which generated a negative decline in comparable sales for the quarter. Asia Pacific,
excluding atmos, generated increases from both strong performance in Australia and New Zealand compared to
last year’s COVID-19 related store closures, coupled with growth in Asia, based on expansion in that region.
Asia Pacific’s increases were affected by the increase in operating days, the current year was essentially open
for all days as compared with approximately 56% and 75% for the quarter and year-to-date periods last year,
respectively.
From a product perspective, for the combined channels for the quarter, increased sales from footwear product
was offset by a decline in apparel sales, while sales of accessories were essentially flat.  For the year-to-date
period, the decline in sales was primarily from lower footwear and apparel sales, offset, in part, by higher sales
of accessories. The decline in footwear for the third quarter was primarily due to lower sales from men’s and
kids’ running footwear products, and the decline in sales of apparel represented lower sales of men’s and
performance apparel products. For the year-to-date period, men’s, kids’, and performance footwear decreased,
offset by a small increase in sales of women’s footwear. Apparel sales decreased in the men’s, kids’, and
performance categories, while sales of women’s product increased.

Components of the change:         
Merchandise margin rate decline   (280)    (210)  
Occupancy and buyers’ compensation
expense rate   10    (20)  
Gross margin is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise,
freight, distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers’
compensation. Occupancy costs include rent (including fixed common area maintenance charges and other
fixed non-lease components), real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities.
The gross margin rate decreased to 32.0% for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2022, as compared with
the corresponding prior-year period, reflecting a 280-basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate, and
a 10-basis point leverage in the occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate. For the thirty-nine weeks ended
October 29, 2022, the gross margin rate declined by 230 basis points, reflecting a 210-basis point decrease in
the merchandise margin rate and a 20-basis point deleverage in the occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate.
Table of Contents
Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 25The declines in merchandise margin rate reflected higher markdowns versus historically-low levels last year and
higher supply chain costs. Additionally, merchandise margin is negatively affected by the recent acquisitions
that generate a lower rate, which is offset by lower occupancy costs and therefore does not significantly affect
the overall gross margin rate. The occupancy rate also reflected the effect of prior year rent abatements related
to COVID-19 that represented $3 million and $14 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks of last year,
respectively, as compared with insignificant amounts this year.

SG&A increased by $9 million, or $32 million excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, for the
thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2022, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. For the year-to-
date period SG&A increased by $56 million, or $109 million excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
Our newly acquired businesses contributed $44 million and $116 million for the quarter and year-to-date
periods, respectively, to the overall increase. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased by 60 basis points and
150 basis points for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, respectively, driven by higher
labor costs, information technology and support expenses, and COVID-19 related matters in the prior year,
partially offset by early savings from our cost optimization program.
SG&A for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022 included nominal payroll subsidies from
local governments, compared with $1 million and $15 million for the corresponding prior-year periods,
respectively.

Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, depreciation and amortization increased by $5 million and
$20 million for the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, respectively, as compared
with the corresponding prior-year periods. The increase was primarily related to the acquisitions of WSS and
atmos.
Impairment and Other Charges
Transformation consulting charges were $17 million and $27 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended
October 29, 2022, respectively. Impairment of long-lived assets and right-of-use assets was not significant and
$5 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, respectively, compared to $13 million
and $52 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021, respectively. Acquisition and
integration costs related to WSS and atmos were $1 million and $4 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks
ended October 29, 2022, respectively, compared with $14 million during each of the prior year periods.
Table of Contents
Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 26We recorded reorganization costs, primarily severance, of $2 million for both the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks
ended October 29, 2022.
For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021, impairment of investments was $30 million and
$32 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021, respectively, due to continued losses
and updated estimates of value for the Company’s minority investments. We recorded charges of $4 million in
lease-related termination costs, and a severance charge of $2 million in connection with the reorganization of
certain support functions, offset by $7 million of insurance recovery income related to 2020 social unrest losses
for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021.

Corporate expense increased by $9 million and $18 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended
October 29, 2022, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods. Depreciation and
amortization included in corporate expense was $10 million and $9 million for the thirteen weeks ended
October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, respectively, and $29 million and $25 million for the thirty-nine weeks
ended October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, respectively. Excluding the changes in depreciation and
amortization, corporate expense increased primarily due to higher information technology and support
expenses.

Division profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 9.9% and 10.3% of sales for the thirteen weeks
and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, respectively, with both sales channels experiencing declines in
gross margin and deleveraging expenses. WSS and atmos generated division profit of $8 million and $4 million,
respectively for the third quarter, and $28 million and $21 million for the year-to-date period. WSS’ division
results for the prior year period was not significant as the acquisition occurred during the quarter.
Our Sidestep business has been underperforming and management is currently reviewing strategic actions to
assess this operation. Management will monitor the results of this business during the fourth quarter and will
assess, if necessary, the effect of various initiatives on the projected performance of this division, which may
include an impairment review.

Sales, and a $15 million loss on minority investments, primarily the decline in the fair value of our Retailors, Ltd.
investment. The thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022 reflected the gain from the divestiture of $19 million,
a decline in our Retailors, Ltd. investment of $52 million, partially offset by $1 million of dividend income.
Other income / (expense), net also includes $3 million and $9 million of franchise income for the thirteen and
thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, respectively. The year-to-date period also includes a charge of
$1 million primarily related to our auction rate security.
Other income for the thirteen weeks ended October 30, 2021 primarily consisted of the $26 million increase in
the fair value of our Retailors, Ltd. investment and other minority investment income of $1 million. The amount
for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021 includes a $290 million increase in the fair value of our
minority investment in GOAT, $50 million of income related to Retailors, Ltd., $4 million related to our insurance
recovery from the 2020 social unrest, and other minority investment income of $3 million.
Activity related to our minority investments and the insurance recovery were all considered our non-GAAP
adjustments in all of the periods presented.

Effective tax rate   33.0%    28.8%    32.4%    27.7%
Our current year interim provision for income taxes was measured using an estimated annual effective tax rate,
which represented a blend of federal, state, and foreign taxes and included the effect of certain nondeductible
items as well as changes in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings or losses, adjusted for discrete items that
occurred within the periods presented.
We regularly assess the adequacy of our provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with applicable
authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, we may adjust the reserves for
unrecognized tax benefits considering new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of
relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes
of limitation.
In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded a $5 million charge related to our income tax reserves due to the
resolution of a foreign tax settlement.  Partially offsetting this charge were tax benefits totaling $2 million from
reserves releases due to various statute of limitation lapses. The changes in tax reserves were not significant
for any of the prior-year periods.
We also recorded a tax expense of $6 million in connection with Eastbay Team Sales divestiture, including the
effect of a non-deductible goodwill write-off, that occurred in the second quarter.
During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, we recorded $1 million of expense related to tax
deficiencies from share-based compensation, as compared with an excess tax benefit of $2 million recorded in
the corresponding prior-year period.
Excluding the above-mentioned discrete items, the effective tax rates for the current year periods increased, as
compared with the corresponding prior-year periods, primarily due to the change in the level and mix of
domestic and foreign earnings.
Our effective tax rate will vary due to numerous factors, such as level and geographic mix of income and losses,
acquisitions, investments, intercompany transactions, foreign currency exchange rates, our stock price,
changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations,
administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax
framework and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions.
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) of 2022 into law. The IRA
contains a number of revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1%
excise tax on corporate stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We do not currently
expect the IRA tax provisions will have a significant effect on our overall effective tax rate.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash have been
to fund inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings,
store remodelings, internet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities; make retirement
plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to
support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies, including strategic investments.
Table of Contents
Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 29We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow
from operations, and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund these
requirements.
The Company may also repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through
open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Share repurchases and retirement of
debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, strategic
considerations, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. As of October 29, 2022,
approximately $1,103 million remained available under our current $1.2 billion share repurchase program,
which was approved in February 2022. The new program does not have an expiration date.
Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer
acceptance of our merchandise mix, retail locations and websites, uncertainties related to the effect of
competitive products and pricing, our reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise
purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of
currency fluctuations, continued uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors listed
under the headings “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and “Risk Factors” could affect our
ability to continue to fund our needs from business operations.

$ Change $  (530)
Operating activities reflects net income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Adjustments
to net income for non-cash items include gains, losses, impairment charges, other charges, depreciation and
amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.
The decrease in cash from operating activities reflected higher merchandise purchases and payments of
accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities, as well as lower net income, as compared with the same
period last year. Higher merchandise purchases were necessary as our year-end inventory levels were affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated supply chain challenges.
As of October 29, 2022, we have withheld approximately $5 million of lease and lease-related payments as we
continue to negotiate rent deferrals or abatements with our landlords for the period that our stores were closed
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

$ Change $  801
The change in investing activities primarily reflected the WSS acquisition in the prior year and higher capital
expenditures in the current year, partially offset by divestiture of certain assets. During the third quarter of 2021,
we completed the acquisition of WSS for $737 million, net of cash acquired. During the thirty-nine weeks ended
October 29, 2022, we paid an additional $18 million for the WSS and atmos acquisitions upon the satisfaction of
certain post-closing conditions.
Table of Contents
Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 30For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, capital expenditures increased by $81 million to $218 million,
as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Our full-year capital spending is expected to be
$265 million. The forecast includes $182 million related to the remodeling or relocation of approximately 140
existing stores and the opening of approximately 110 new stores, as well as $83 million for the development of
information systems, websites, and infrastructure, including supply chain initiatives.
We have invested $5 million in minority investments during the current year, including various limited partner
venture capital funds managed by Black fund managers, who are committed to advancing diverse-led
businesses as part of our Leading in Education and Economic Development (LEED) initiative. During the
second quarter of 2022, we sold our position in one of our minority investments receiving proceeds of
$12 million. In the prior-year period, we invested $115 million which was comprised of an additional $33 million
investment in GOAT, a $68 million investment in a public entity (Retailors, Ltd.), and a $14 million investment in
various companies, primarily related to LEED.
Also during the second quarter of 2022, we sold our Eastbay Team Sales business receiving proceeds of
$47 million.
We sold the former Runners Point headquarters in the first quarter of 2021, generating proceeds of $3 million.
Also last year, we received insurance proceeds of $3 million related to property and equipment claims from the
social unrest losses in 2020.

During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, we repurchased 4,050,000 shares of common stock for
$129 million under our share repurchase programs, whereas in the prior year we spent $170 million to
repurchase shares. We also declared and paid $113 million in dividends representing a quarterly rate of $0.40
per share in 2022, as compared with $72 million in dividends representing quarterly rates of $0.20 per share for
the first two quarters of 2021 and $0.30 per share for the third quarter.
We paid $1 million to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the vesting of share-based equity awards
during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, as compared with $11 million in 2021. Offsetting this
amount were proceeds received in connection with employee stock programs of $7 million in the current year,
as compared with $17 million in the prior-year period. Additionally, we paid $5 million of principal on our finance
lease obligations, mainly related to certain WSS stores.
Cash provided by financing activities in the prior-year period consisted primarily of the issuance of the 4% Notes
due 2029, for which we received $395 million in proceeds, net of the initial purchasers’ discount.

Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
 Foot Locker, Inc.:
Results of Review of Interim Financial Information
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheets of Foot Locker, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, and changes in shareholders’ equity for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 29, 2022 and
October 30, 2021, the related condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the thirty-nine week periods ended
October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information).
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim
financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of January 29, 2022, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended
(not presented herein); and in our report dated March 24, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as
of January 29, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has
been derived.
Basis for Review Results
This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.
We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial
and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
