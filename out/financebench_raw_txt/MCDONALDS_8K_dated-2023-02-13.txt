(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On February 13, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of McDonald's Corporation (the “Company”) approved the payout structure for
the 2023 Target Incentive Plan (“TIP”) awards for executives.
The target 2023 TIP awards for the Company’s named executive officers, as reflected in the Company’s 2022 proxy statement, are as shown in the table below.
Name Position Target TIP Award as a Percentage of Base Salary
Christopher Kempczinski President and Chief Executive Officer 200%
Ian Borden Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 125%
Kevin Ozan Senior Executive Vice President, Strategic Initiatives 120%
Joseph Erlinger President, McDonald’s USA 120%
Desiree Ralls-Morrison Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate
Secretary100%
2023 TIP payouts will be primarily determined by the Company's 2023 performance on two key financial performance metrics: operating income (40%) and
Systemwide sales (30%), which include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. In addition to the financial metrics, 2023
TIP payouts to the named executive officers listed above will also include quantitative human capital metrics (15%) and a new metric measuring the number of
new restaurant openings (15%).
Each of these metrics is viewed as a critical driver of the Company’s success.
•Operating income is a key component of the Company’s strategy because it requires the Company to balance increases in revenue with financial
discipline to produce strong margins.
•Systemwide sales is important in our franchise model because income generation is closely correlated to sales growth and is a good measure of
franchisee health given our large percentage of franchised restaurants.
•The quantitative human capital metrics are focused on championing the Company’s core value by improving diversity representation in leadership
roles for women globally and underrepresented groups in the U.S.
•New restaurant openings measures a key component of the Company’s refreshed Accelerating the Arches growth strategy.
The financial metrics and new restaurant openings are measured on a consolidated or business segment level basis, as applicable to each individual. For
Messrs. Borden, Kempczinski and Ozan, and for Ms. Ralls-Morrison, the payout will be based on (i) consolidated financial performance (operating income and
Systemwide sales); (ii) human capital metrics measured on a consolidated basis; and (iii) the number of new restaurant openings for both the McDonald’s USA
and International Operated Markets business segments. For Mr. Erlinger, the payout will be based on (i) a combination of McDonald’s USA and consolidated
financial performance (operating income and Systemwide sales); (ii) human capital metrics measured on a consolidated basis; and (iii) the number of new
restaurant openings for McDonald’s USA.
Further, in order to continue to strengthen our franchisee base, a TIP modifier that measures the number and diversity of new franchisees will apply to Mr.
Erlinger. This modifier can increase or decrease Mr. Erlinger’s 2023 TIP by 15 TIP percentage points.
The maximum 2023 TIP award that any of the above individuals can earn is 200% of the target award.
For compensation purposes, performance results may be adjusted from those reported in our financial statements in order to focus our executives on the
fundamentals of the Company’s underlying business performance. For example, results are expressed in constant currencies to neutralize the impact of foreign
currency translation.
