FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report contains information that may constitute "forward-looking statements." Generally, the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will" and similar
expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not
forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume
growth, share of sales and earnings per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future operating results — are forward-looking statements. Management believes that
these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such
statements speak only as of the date when made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from our Company's historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk
Factors" and elsewhere in this report and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
PART I
 
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
In this report, the terms "The Coca-Cola Company," "Company," "we," "us" and "our" mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.
General
The Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company. We own or license and market more than 
500
 nonalcoholic beverage brands including sparkling beverages and a variety of
still beverages such as waters, flavored waters and enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, sports drinks, dairy, and energy drinks. We own and market 
four
 of
the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886,
are now sold in more than 
200
 countries.
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations as well as
independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for
more than 
1.9 billion
 of the approximately 
59 billion
 servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.
We believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further
depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.
Our goal is to use our Company's assets — our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and
associates — to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners.
We were incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same name that had been organized in 1892.
Operating Segments
The Company's operating structure is the basis for our internal financial reporting. As of 
December 31, 2016
, our operating structure included the following operating segments, the first five of
which are sometimes referred to as "operating groups" or "groups":
•
Europe, Middle East and
Africa
•
Latin
America
•
North
America
•
Asia
Pacific
•
Bottling
Investments
•
Corporate
1
Except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, the description of our business in this report is presented on a
consolidated basis.
For financial information about our operating segments and geographic areas, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, "Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data" of this report, incorporated herein by reference. For certain risks attendant to our non-U.S. operations, refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" below.
Products and Brands
As used in this report:
•
"concentrates" means flavoring ingredients and, depending on the product, sweeteners used to prepare syrups or finished beverages and includes powders for purified water products such
as Dasani;
•
"syrups" means beverage ingredients produced by combining concentrates and, depending on the product, sweeteners and added
water;
•
"fountain syrups" means syrups that are sold to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and convenience stores, which use dispensing equipment to mix the syrups with sparkling or still
water at the time of purchase to produce finished beverages that are served in cups or glasses for immediate consumption;
•
"sparkling beverages" means nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages with carbonation, including carbonated energy drinks and carbonated waters and flavored
waters;
•
"still beverages" means nonalcoholic beverages without carbonation, including noncarbonated waters, flavored waters and enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas
and coffees, sports drinks, dairy, and noncarbonated energy drinks;
•
"Company Trademark Beverages" means beverages bearing our trademarks and certain other beverage products bearing trademarks licensed to us by third parties for which we provide
marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit; and
•
"Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages" or "Trademark Coca-Cola" means beverages bearing the trademark Coca-Cola or any trademark that includes Coca-Cola or Coke (that is, Coca-Cola,
Coca-Cola Life, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light and Coca-Cola Zero and all their variations and any line extensions, including caffeine free Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, etc.). Likewise, when
we use the capitalized word "Trademark" together with the name of one of our other beverage products (such as "Trademark Fanta," "Trademark Sprite" or "Trademark Simply"), we
mean beverages bearing the indicated trademark (that is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its variations and line extensions (such that "Trademark Fanta" includes Fanta
Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Apple, etc.; "Trademark Sprite" includes Sprite, Diet Sprite, Sprite Zero, Sprite Light, etc.; and "Trademark Simply" includes Simply Orange, Simply
Apple, Simply Grapefruit, etc.).
Our Company markets, manufactures and sells:
•
beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as "beverage bases," and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our "concentrate business" or
"concentrate operations"); and
•
finished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our "finished product business" or "finished product
operations").
Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.
In our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our
"bottlers" or our "bottling partners"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or combine the syrups
with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers — such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles —
bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell
concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and
convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to
fountain retailers.
2
Our finished product operations consist primarily of our Company-owned or -controlled bottling, sales and distribution operations, including Coca-Cola Refreshments' ("CCR") bottling and
associated supply chain operations in the United States and Canada, and are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. Our finished product operations generate net operating
revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to
retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers,
such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell
the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment. We authorize these wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through
nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the
United States.
For information about net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading "Our Business — General" set
forth in Part II, "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

•
We and certain of our bottlers distribute certain brands of Monster Beverage Corporation ("Monster"), primarily Monster Energy, in designated territories in the United States, Canada
and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster and related distribution agreements between Monster and
Company-owned or -controlled bottling operations, including CCR, and independent bottling and distribution partners.
•
We produce and/or distribute certain other third-party brands, including brands owned by Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. ("DPSG"), which we produce and distribute in designated
territories in the United States and Canada pursuant to license agreements with DPSG.
•
We have a strategic partnership with Aujan Industries Company J.S.C. ("Aujan"), one of the largest independent beverage companies in the Middle East. We own 50 percent of the
entity that holds the rights in certain territories to brands produced and distributed by Aujan, including Rani, a juice brand, and Barbican, a flavored malt beverage brand.
•
We have a joint venture with Nestlé S.A. ("Nestlé") named Beverage Partners Worldwide ("BPW") which markets and distributes Nestea products in Europe and Canada under
agreements with our bottlers. The Nestea trademark is owned by Société des Produits Nestlé S.A.

Consumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings. Consumer demand can vary from one market to another and can change over time within a single market.
Employing our business strategy, our Company seeks to further build its existing brands and, at the same time, to broaden its portfolio of brands, products and services in order to create and
satisfy consumer demand in every market.
We measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, "unit case" means a unit of
measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), and "unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company
beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners ("Coca-Cola system") to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing
Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our
Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has
an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case
volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of
concentrates and syrups (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case
volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of
price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and
concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to the items mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest but to
which the Company does not sell concentrates or syrups may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.
Distribution System
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations,
independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — the world's largest beverage distribution system. Consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing trademarks owned
by or licensed to us at a rate of more than 
1.9 billion
 servings each day. We continue to expand our marketing presence in an effort to increase our unit case volume and net operating revenues
in developed, developing and emerging markets. Our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us to capture growth by manufacturing, distributing and marketing existing,
enhanced and new innovative products to our consumers throughout the world.
The Coca-Cola system sold 
29.3 billion
, 
29.2 billion
 and 
28.6 billion
 unit cases of our products in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. Sparkling beverages represented 72 percent, 73 percent and
73 percent of our worldwide unit case volume for 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 45 percent, 46 percent and 46 percent of our worldwide unit case
volume for 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively.
In 
2016
, unit case volume in the United States represented 19 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume, 66 percent was attributable to sparkling
beverages and 34 percent to still beverages. Trademark 
Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 
81 percent
 of the
Company's worldwide unit case volume for 
2016
. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and Japan, which together
accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 73 percent was attributable to sparkling beverages and 27 percent to still beverages. Trademark
Coca-Cola accounted for 46 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.
Our five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 
2016
 were:
•
Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Coca-Cola FEMSA"), which has bottling and distribution operations in
 
Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as
well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (Guatemala City and surrounding areas), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most
of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (greater São Paulo, Campiñas, Santos, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paraná, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state
of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goiás, part of the state of Rio de Janeiro and part of the state of Minas Gerais), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding
areas) and the Philippines (nationwide);
•
Coca-Cola European Partners plc ("CCEP"), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Luxembourg, Monaco, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden;
4
•
Coca-Cola HBC AG ("Coca-Cola Hellenic"), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic
of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;
•
Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador and Peru;
and
•
Coca-Cola İçecek A.Ş. ("Coca-Cola İçecek"), which has bottling and distribution operations in Azerbaijan, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey and
Turkmenistan and distribution operations in Syria.
In 
2016
, these five bottling partners combined represented 39 percent of our total unit case volume.
Being a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.
Bottler's Agreements
We have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as "bottler's agreements," with our bottling partners regarding the manufacture and sale of Company products. Subject to specified terms
and conditions and certain variations, the bottler’s agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare specified Company Trademark Beverages, to package the same in authorized
containers, and to distribute and sell the same in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of
concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or
from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers; however, we
typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory, (2) to
prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with
local law), and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).
While under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a
practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the
United States, to competitive market conditions. In addition, in some instances we have agreed or may in the future agree with a bottler with respect to concentrate pricing on a prospective basis
for specified time periods. Also, in some markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned incentives and the flexibility
necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we worked with our bottling partners to develop and implement an incidence-based pricing model for sparkling and still
beverages. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products are
sold and package mix.
As further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.
Bottler's Agreements Outside the United States
Bottler's agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the United States generally are of stated duration, subject in some cases to possible extensions or renewals. Generally, these
bottler's agreements are subject to termination by the Company following the occurrence of certain designated events, including defined events of default and certain changes in ownership or
control of the bottlers. Most of the bottler's agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the United States authorize the bottlers to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups, usually on
a nonexclusive basis.
In certain parts of the world outside the United States, we have not granted comprehensive beverage production rights to the bottlers. In such instances, we or our authorized suppliers sell
Company Trademark Beverages to the bottlers for sale and distribution throughout the designated territory, often on a nonexclusive basis.
Bottler's Agreements Within the United States
During the year ended 
December 31, 2016
, our Company-owned operations manufactured, sold and distributed 
75 percent
 of our U.S. unit case volume. The discussion below relates to bottler's
agreements for territories in the United States that are not covered by Company-owned operations.
In the United States, most bottler’s agreements are of stated duration, subject in most cases to renewal rights of bottlers and in some cases to renewal rights of the Company. Certain bottler's
agreements for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored beverages have no stated expiration date. The bottler's agreements in the United States are subject to termination by
5
the Company for nonperformance or upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to contract.
In conjunction with implementing a new beverage partnership model in North America, the Company granted certain additional exclusive territory rights for the distribution, promotion,
marketing and sale of Company-owned and licensed beverage products (as defined by the comprehensive beverage agreements ("CBAs")) to certain U.S. bottlers. These expanding bottlers
entered into new CBAs, to which we sometimes refer as "expanding bottler CBAs." Under the expanding bottler CBAs, the Company generally retained the rights to produce the applicable
beverage products for territories not covered by specific manufacturing agreements and such bottlers purchase from the Company (or from Company-authorized manufacturing bottlers)
substantially all of the finished beverage products needed in order to service the customers in these territories. The expanding bottler CBA has a term of 10 years and is renewable, in most cases
by the bottler, and in some cases by the Company, indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each, and includes additional requirements that provide for, among other things, a
binding national governance model, mandatory incidence pricing and certain core performance requirements. The Company also entered into, or agreed to enter into, manufacturing agreements
that authorize certain expanding bottlers that have executed expanding bottler CBAs to manufacture certain beverage products for their own account and for supply to other bottlers. Certain
expanding bottlers in the United States also agreed to convert their bottler's agreements for legacy territories and initial CBAs to a single form of expanding bottler CBA, which will provide
consistency across each such bottler's respective territory, and consistency with other U.S. bottlers that have been granted or converted to an expanding bottler CBA. In addition, certain U.S.
bottlers that were not granted additional exclusive territory rights agreed to convert their bottler’s agreements for legacy territories to a form of comprehensive beverage agreement to which we
sometimes refer as "non-expanding bottler CBA." This form of CBA has a term of 10 years and is renewable by the bottler indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each and is
substantially similar in most material respects to the expanding bottler CBA, including with respect to requirements for a binding national governance model and mandatory incidence pricing,
but includes core performance requirements that vary in certain respects from those in the expanding bottler CBA.
Certain of our bottlers continue to operate under bottler's agreements for certain Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages that include pricing
formulas that generally provide for a baseline price. This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company, up to a maximum indexed ceiling price, and is adjusted quarterly based
upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. Certain other bottlers operate under our oldest form of bottler's agreement which provides for a fixed price for Coca-Cola syrup
used in bottles and cans, and this price is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the quoted price of sugar. The U.S. unit case volume manufactured, sold and distributed under
these legacy bottler's agreements is not material.
Under the terms of the bottler's agreements, bottlers in the United States generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups. Rather, the Company manufactures and sells fountain
syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain authorized bottlers) and some fountain retailers. These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups or deliver them on our behalf to
restaurants and other retailers.

In addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing services and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this
on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler's or distribution agreements between our
Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many
instances, we provide promotional and marketing services and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing
agreements. The aggregate amount of funds provided by our Company to bottlers, resellers or other customers of our Company's products, principally for participation in promotional and
marketing programs, was $
6.6 billion
 in 
2016
.
Investments in Bottling Operations
Most of our branded beverage products are manufactured, sold and distributed by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of bottling operations,
often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning such a controlling interest enables us to compensate for limited
local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure
for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a Company-owned or -controlled bottler,
typically by selling our interest in a particular bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell our interest in a bottling operation to one of
our other bottling partners in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method
investee's earnings or losses.
6
In addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of
the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are
intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased concentrate sales for our Company's concentrate and syrup
business. When this occurs, both we and our bottling partners benefit from long-term growth in volume and improved cash flows. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to
exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method, and we sometimes refer to such a bottler as an
"equity method investee bottler" or "equity method investee."
Our equity method investee bottlers include Coca-Cola FEMSA, CCEP, Coca-Cola Hellenic and Coca-Cola İçecek, in which as of 
December 31, 2016
, we had equity ownership interests of 
28
percent
, 
18 percent
, 
23 percent
 and 20 percent, respectively.
Seasonality
Sales of our nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the
beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.
Competition
The nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry is highly competitive, consisting of numerous companies ranging from small or emerging to very large and well
established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products
include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling beverages; various water products, including packaged, flavored and enhanced waters; juices and nectars; fruit drinks and dilutables (including syrups
and powdered drinks); coffees and teas; energy and sports and other performance-enhancing drinks; filtered milk and other dairy-based drinks; functional beverages, including vitamin-based
products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive beverages are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and other than ready-to-drink form. In
many of the countries in which we do business, including the United States, PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo"), is one of our primary competitors. Other significant competitors include, but are not
limited to, Nestlé, DPSG, Groupe Danone, Mondelēz International, Inc. ("Mondelēz"), The Kraft Heinz Company ("Kraft"), Suntory Beverage & Food Limited ("Suntory") and Unilever. In
certain markets, our competition also includes beer companies. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, in some markets, against retailers that have developed
their own store or private label beverage brands.
Competitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs, product innovation, increased efficiency in production techniques, the
introduction of new packaging, new vending and dispensing equipment, and brand and trademark development and protection.
Our competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer acceptance; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing
capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated associates. Our competitive challenges include strong competition in all geographic regions and, in many countries, a concentrated retail sector
with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers' own store or private label beverage brands.
Raw Materials
Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural resource in many parts
of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we operate, as one of the key challenges facing
our business.
In addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, the principal nutritive sweetener is high fructose corn syrup
("HFCS"), which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. HFCS is available from numerous domestic sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. The principal
nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States is sucrose, i.e., table sugar, which is also available from numerous sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in
its market price. Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, we purchase HFCS to meet our and our
bottlers' requirements with the assistance of Coca-Cola Bottlers' Sales & Services Company LLC ("CCBSS"). CCBSS is a limited liability company that is owned by authorized Coca-Cola
bottlers doing business in the United States. Among other things, CCBSS provides procurement services to our Company for the purchase of various goods and services in the United States,
including HFCS.
7
The principal non-nutritive sweeteners we use in our business are aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate and steviol glycoside. Generally, these raw materials are
readily available from numerous sources. However, our Company purchases aspartame, an important non-nutritive sweetener that is used alone or in combination with other important non-
nutritive sweeteners such as saccharin or acesulfame potassium in our low- and no-calorie sparkling beverage products, primarily from Ajinomoto Co., Inc. and SinoSweet Co., Ltd., which we
consider to be our primary sources for the supply of this product. In addition, we purchase sucralose, which we consider a critical raw material, from a limited number of suppliers in the United
States and China. We work closely with our primary sucralose suppliers to maintain continuity of supply. However, global demand for sucralose has increased in recent years as consumer
products companies are reformulating food and beverages to replace high-intensity sweeteners with non-nutritive sweeteners, primarily sucralose. In addition, the Chinese sucralose industry
has been impacted by the imposition of stringent environmental requirements that have reduced or closed production. To mitigate the impact of the increase in demand and tightening of supply
of sucralose, we are working with our existing suppliers to secure additional volume and are expanding our sucralose supplier base as well as assessing additional internal contingency plans to
address any potential shortages. Our Company generally has not experienced major difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non-nutritive sweeteners and we do not anticipate such
difficulties in the future.
Juice and juice concentrate from various fruits, particularly orange juice and orange juice concentrate, are the principal raw materials for our juice and juice drink products. We source our
orange juice and orange juice concentrate primarily from Florida and the Southern Hemisphere (particularly Brazil). We work closely with Cutrale Citrus Juices U.S.A., Inc., our primary
supplier of orange juice from Florida and Brazil, to ensure an adequate supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate that meets our Company's standards. However, the citrus industry is
impacted by greening disease and the variability of weather conditions. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice
and orange juice concentrate throughout the industry. In addition, greening disease is reducing the number of trees and increasing grower costs and prices.
Our Company-owned or consolidated bottling and canning operations and our finished product business also purchase various other raw materials including, but not limited to, polyethylene
terephthalate ("PET") resin, preforms and bottles; glass and aluminum bottles; aluminum and steel cans; plastic closures; aseptic fiber packaging; labels; cartons; cases; postmix packaging; and
carbon dioxide. We generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not experienced significant shortages.
Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
Our Company owns numerous patents, copyrights and trade secrets, as well as substantial know-how and technology, which we collectively refer to in this report as "technology." This
technology generally relates to our Company's products and the processes for their production; the packages used for our products; the design and operation of various processes and equipment
used in our business; and certain quality assurance software. Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties. Our sparkling beverage and other beverage formulae are among
the important trade secrets of our Company.
We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly
maintained. Pursuant to our bottler's agreements, we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their manufacture, sale and distribution of Company
products. In addition, we grant licenses to third parties from time to time to use certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and food products.
Governmental Regulation
Our Company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business. In many jurisdictions,
compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those
jurisdictions.
In the United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and sale of our Company's products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various
federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar
statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements.

Under a California law known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must be provided for any product sold in
the state that exposes consumers to that substance. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. Proposition 65 exposes all food and
beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in California because it does not provide for any generally applicable quantitative threshold below which
the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the
requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily
quantity of a listed substance that is:
•
below a "safe harbor" threshold that may be
established;
•
naturally
occurring;
•
the result of necessary cooking;
or
•
subject to another applicable
exemption.
One or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 lists, or that may be added in the future, can be detected in certain Company products at low levels that are safe. With respect to
substances that have not yet been listed under Proposition 65, the Company takes the position that listing is not scientifically justified. With respect to substances that are already listed, the
Company takes the position that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise
in compliance with Proposition 65. The state of California and other parties, however, have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future.
Bottlers of our beverage products presently offer and use nonrefillable recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around the world. Some of these bottlers also offer
and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be
charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating
to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate that additional such legal
requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.
All of our Company's facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those
relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not
expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our Company's capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.
Employees
As of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, our Company had approximately 
100,300
 and 123,200 employees, respectively, of which approximately 2,900 and 3,300, respectively, were employed by
consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"). The decrease in the total number of employees in 
2016
 was primarily due to the refranchising of certain bottling territories that were previously
managed by CCR to certain of the Company's unconsolidated bottling partners, as well as the deconsolidation of our German and South African bottling operations. For more information about
the North America refranchising transactions and deconsolidation of our German and South African bottling operations, refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth
in Part II, "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report. As of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, our Company had approximately 
51,000
 and 60,900 employees,
respectively, located in the United States, of which approximately 400 and 500, respectively, were employed by consolidated VIEs.
Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. As of 
December 31, 2016
, approximately 
16,300
 employees, excluding seasonal
hires, in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically have terms of 
three years
 to 
five years
. We currently expect that we will be able to
renegotiate such agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.
The Company believes that its relations with its employees are generally satisfactory.

Securities Exchange Act Reports
The Company maintains a website at the following address: www.coca-colacompany.com. The information on the Company's website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.
We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in accordance
with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). These include our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on
Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
 
ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also
may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.
Obesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.
There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. Increasing public concern about obesity;
other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages; possible new or increased taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce
consumption or to raise revenue; additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sugar-sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting
from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce demand for or increase
the cost of our sugar-sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.
Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system's costs and capacity.
Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process. It
also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing demand
for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require water, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change. As the demand for
water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity
constraints that could adversely affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run.
If we do not address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer.
Consumer preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, especially the perceived undesirability of artificial
ingredients and obesity concerns; shifting consumer demographics, including aging populations; changes in consumer tastes and needs; changes in consumer lifestyles; location of origin or
source of products and ingredients; and competitive product and pricing pressures. If we fail to address these changes, or do not successfully anticipate future changes in consumer preferences,
our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.
Increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace could hurt our business.
The nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry is highly competitive. We compete with major international beverage companies that, like our Company, operate in
multiple geographic areas, as well as numerous companies that are primarily regional or local in operation. In many countries in which we do business, including the United States, PepsiCo is a
primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestlé, DPSG, Groupe Danone, Mondelēz, Kraft, Suntory and Unilever. In certain markets, our competition
also includes major beer companies that also distribute nonalcoholic beverages. Our beverage products also compete against private label brands developed by retailers, some of which are
Coca-Cola system customers. Our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the global market or in various local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. If we do not
continue to strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain our brand loyalty and market share while we selectively expand into other profitable categories in the
nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.
10
Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which
we expect our operations as well as our bottling partners to meet. However, we cannot assure you that despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality we or all of our bottling
partners will always meet these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions of products, such as value-added dairy products, that are beyond
our traditional range of beverage products. If we or our bottling partners fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards, or if our beverage products taken to the market are
or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which
could cause our business to suffer.
Public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients, such as non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other
substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products.
Public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived
substances; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole ("4-MEI," a chemical compound that
is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-type beverages); or substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A ("BPA," an odorless,
tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans), may affect consumers' preferences and cause them to
shift away from some of our beverage products. In addition, increasing public concern about actual or perceived health consequences of the presence of such ingredients or substances in our
beverage products or in packaging materials, whether or not justified, could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing, labeling or sale of our beverages; possible
new or increased taxes on our beverages by government entities; and negative publicity, or actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry, all of which could
damage the reputation of, and may reduce demand for, our beverage products.
If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.
Achieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop, introduce and
market new beverage products. The success of our innovation activities in turn depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, obtain, maintain and
enforce necessary intellectual property protections and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, we may not be able to
achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.
Increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity may negatively affect our business.
We and our bottling partners use a number of key ingredients that are derived from agricultural commodities such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea in the manufacture and
packaging of our beverage products. Increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may
limit the availability or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. If we are unable to implement programs focused
on economic opportunity and environmental sustainability to address these agricultural challenges and fail to make a strategic impact on food security through joint efforts with bottlers,
farmers, communities, suppliers and key partners, as well as through our increased and continued investment in sustainable agriculture, the affordability of our products and ultimately our
business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.
Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial performance.
Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the retail channel, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger retailers may seek lower prices from us and our
bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private label brands, any of
which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system's profitability. In addition, in developed markets, discounters and value stores, as well as the volume of transactions through e-commerce,
are growing at a rapid pace. The nonalcoholic beverage retail landscape is also very dynamic and constantly evolving in emerging and developing markets, where modern trade is growing at a
faster pace than traditional trade outlets. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing environment and retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial
results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail and foodservice customers. The loss of one or more of
our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.
11
If we are unable to expand our operations in emerging and developing markets, our growth rate could be negatively affected.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets and on our
ability to work with local bottlers to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Moreover, the supply of our
products in emerging and developing markets must match consumers’ demand for those products. Due to product price, limited purchasing power and cultural differences, there can be no
assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging or developing market.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real and the Mexican
peso. In 2016, we used 72 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived $22.0 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our
consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect
during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and
the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. For information regarding the estimated impact of currency fluctuations on our consolidated and operating segment net
operating revenues for 2016 and 2015, refer to the heading "Operations Review - Net Operating Revenues" set forth in Part II, "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" of this report. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. We
also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, would not materially affect our financial results.
If interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.
We maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital, which
increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our
exposure to interest rate risks. We cannot assure you, however, that our financial risk management program will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate
fluctuations. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. In assessing our credit strength, credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well
as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some credit rating agencies also consider financial information of certain of our major bottlers. It
is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure; our major
bottlers' financial performance; changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength; the credit agencies' perception of the impact of credit market conditions on
our or our major bottlers' current or future financial performance and financial condition; or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if the credit ratings of
certain bottlers in which we have equity method investments were to be downgraded, such bottlers' interest expense could increase, which would reduce our equity income.
We rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners, our business could suffer.
We generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. As independent companies, our bottling partners, some of
which are publicly traded companies, make their own business decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, many of our bottling partners have the right to manufacture or
distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our bottling partners through a combination of
pricing and marketing and advertising support, or if our bottling partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and development efforts, they may take actions that, while maximizing their
own short-term profits, may be detrimental to our Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their energy and resources to business opportunities or products other than those of the
Company. Such actions could, in the long run, have an adverse effect on our profitability.
12
If our bottling partners' financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could be affected.
We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners and, therefore, the success of our business depends on our
bottling partners' financial strength and profitability. While under our agreements with our bottling partners we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our
concentrates and syrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners' financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition,
we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling partners'
income or loss. Our bottling partners' financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including competitive and general market
conditions in the territories in which they operate; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; or disruptions of bottling operations that
may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could
adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups; and, if applicable, could result in a decrease in our equity income and/or result in impairments of our equity
method investments.
Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
We are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates
and the geographic mix of our income before taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates,
geographic mix, or foreign exchange rates could reduce our after-tax income. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries. If our capital or financing needs in the United
States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted.
Our annual tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and
in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our
historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have a material effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable
final determinations are made and for periods for which the statute of limitations is open. For instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") is seeking to increase our U.S.
taxable income for tax years 2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a potential additional U.S. federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for the period, plus interest. The
IRS may add a claim for penalties at a later time. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer pricing matter involving the appropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report
in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to certain related foreign licensees regarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of
products in overseas markets. We are currently contesting the IRS' claims in the U.S. Tax Court. If the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, it would likely also seek transfer pricing adjustments
of a similar nature for subsequent tax years. Consequently, if this dispute were to be ultimately determined adversely to us, the additional tax, interest and any potential penalties could have a
material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The current U.S. administration has listed tax reform among its top policy priorities, and the U.S. Congress is reviewing various legislative tax proposals. Until further details emerge, it is
premature to predict how such proposals ultimately may impact our business. Potential legislation is likely to include provisions that impact our business both favorably and unfavorably as
compared to current law. Pending further development of those provisions and potential legislative enactment, we are unable to determine whether the net impact would produce a positive or
negative impact, and what actions we may take as a consequence.
Increased or new indirect taxes in the United States and throughout the world could negatively affect our business.
Our business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income, sometimes referred to as "indirect taxes," including import duties, excise taxes, sales or value-
added taxes, taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, property taxes and payroll taxes, in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including indirect taxes imposed by state and local
governments. In addition, in the past, the U.S. Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar, HFCS or other nutritive sweeteners and may consider
similar proposals in the future. As federal, state and local governments in the United States and throughout the world experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers have singled out
beverages among a plethora of revenue-raising items and have imposed or increased, or proposed to impose or increase, sales or similar taxes on beverages, particularly sugar-sweetened
beverages. Increases in or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or products would increase the cost of products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make
our products less affordable, which may negatively impact our net operating revenues and profitability.
13
Increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of energy or fuels could affect our profitability.
Our Company-owned or -controlled bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute and deliver beverage products to customers. In addition, we use a significant
amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate our concentrate, syrup and juice production plants and the bottling plants and distribution facilities operated by our
Company-owned or -controlled bottlers. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources in countries in which we have concentrate plants, or in any of
the major markets in which our Company-owned or 
-controlled bottlers operate, that may be caused by increasing demand or by events such as natural disasters, power outages, or the like
could increase our operating costs and negatively impact our profitability.
Our independent bottling partners also operate large fleets of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute and deliver beverage products to their own customers and use a significant amount of
electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate their own bottling plants and distribution facilities. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy
sources in any of the major markets in which our independent bottling partners operate could increase the affected independent bottling partners' operating costs and thus indirectly negatively
impact our results of operations.
Increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of ingredients, other raw materials or packaging materials could harm our business.
We and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business, including HFCS, sucrose, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate, steviol glycosides, ascorbic
acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid, caffeine and caramel color; other raw materials such as orange and other fruit juice and juice concentrates; and packaging materials such as PET for bottles
and aluminum for cans. The prices for these ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. Substantial increases in the prices of our or our
bottling partners' ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials, to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage products, would increase
our and our bottling partners' operating costs and could reduce our profitability. Increases in the prices of our finished products resulting from a higher cost of ingredients, other raw materials
and packaging materials could affect affordability in some markets and reduce Coca-Cola system sales. In addition, some of our ingredients, such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium,
sucralose, saccharin and ascorbic acid, as well as some packaging containers, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers, and certain other ingredients are
available from only one source each. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are located in countries experiencing political or other risks. We cannot assure you that we and our bottling partners
will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages of
any ingredient that is available from a limited number of suppliers or from only one source
.
The citrus industry is impacted by the variability of weather conditions and by greening disease, which affect the supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate, which are important raw
materials for our business. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate throughout the
industry. In addition, greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs and prices. Adverse weather conditions may affect the supply of other agricultural
commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. For example, drought conditions in certain parts of the United States may negatively affect the supply of corn, which in
turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for HFCS
.
An increase in the cost, a sustained interruption in the supply, or a shortage of some of these ingredients, other raw materials, packaging materials or cans and other containers that may be
caused by a deterioration of our or our bottling partners' relationships with suppliers; by supplier quality and reliability issues; or by events such as natural disasters, power outages, labor
strikes, political uncertainties or governmental instability, or the like could negatively impact our net operating revenues and profits.
Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products.
We and our bottlers currently offer nonrefillable recyclable containers in the United States and in various other markets around the world. Legal requirements have been enacted in various
jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. Other
proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotax and/or product stewardship have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas, and we anticipate
that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers' increased concerns and changing
attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the adoption of such legislation or regulations. If these types of requirements are
adopted and implemented on a large scale in any of the major markets in which we operate, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net
operating revenues and profitability.
14
Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products.
Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what they contain or
allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or
regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.
Under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must be provided for any
product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. Proposition 65 exposes all
food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in California because it does not provide for any generally applicable quantitative threshold
below which the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product
to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes
consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is below a "safe harbor" threshold that may be established, is naturally occurring, is the result of necessary cooking or is subject to
another applicable exception. One or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 lists, or that may be added to the lists in the future, can be detected in certain Company products
at low levels that are safe. With respect to substances that have not yet been listed under Proposition 65, the Company takes the position that listing is not scientifically justified. With respect to
substances that are already listed, the Company takes the position that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning
requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. The state of California and other parties, however, have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in
the future. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our beverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the
warnings and possible adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets.
If we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted and our reputation
may be damaged.
We rely on networks and information systems and other technology ("information systems"), including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and
activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, mergers and acquisitions and research and development. We use
information systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements.
In addition, we depend on information systems for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations around the world and between Company personnel and our
bottlers and other customers, suppliers and consumers. Because information systems are critical to many of the Company's operating activities, our business may be impacted by system
shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine operations such as system upgrades or by user errors, as well as network or
hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, cyberattacks by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state
organizations or social-activist (hacktivist) organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events. In
addition, such incidents could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business
continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our
inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments for concentrate or finished products. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data
privacy laws and regulations, damage to the reputation and credibility of the Company, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands and loss of ability to commercialize
products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net operating revenues. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational
damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, or to our bottling partners, other customers, suppliers or consumers, and
may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by
a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems
.
15
Like most major corporations, the Company's information systems are a target of attacks. Although the incidents that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. In order to address risks to our
information systems, we continue to make investments in personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Company personnel. The Company maintains an information risk
management program which is supervised by information technology management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee. As part of this program, reports that include analysis of
emerging risks as well as the Company's plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States could negatively impact our financial performance.
In 2016, our net operating revenues in the United States were $19.9 billion, or 48 percent, of our total net operating revenues. Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or
economic slowdown, in the United States could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages in our flagship market. Under difficult economic conditions,
consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies,
including private label brands. Softer consumer demand for our beverages in the United States could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance.
Unfavorable economic and political conditions in international markets could hurt our business.
We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of our products in international markets. In 2016, our operations outside the United States accounted for $22.0 billion,
or 52 percent, of our total net operating revenues. Unfavorable economic conditions and financial uncertainties in our major international markets, including uncertainties surrounding the
United Kingdom's impending withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit," and unstable political conditions, including civil unrest and governmental changes, in
certain of our other international markets could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers' purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Product boycotts
resulting from political activism could reduce demand for our products, while restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders, price controls, limitation on profits, import
authorization requirements and other restrictions on business activities which have been or may be imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability or otherwise, could
impact our profitability. In addition, U.S. trade sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions
for commerce within such countries could increase significantly, which could make it impossible for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries. The imposition of retaliatory
sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to U.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of our branded products by retailers in various countries in
reaction to U.S. trade sanctions or other governmental action or policy, could also negatively affect our business.
Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.
We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, litigation claims and legal proceedings arising out of our
advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, intellectual property and commercial disputes, and environmental and employment matters. We evaluate these litigation claims
and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish
reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time
and involve a significant amount of management judgment. We caution you that actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and
estimates. In addition, we have bottling and other business operations in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our
associates and agents with all United States and local laws and regulations and consent orders applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to
government officials. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our policies, procedures and related training programs will always ensure full compliance by our associates and agents with all
applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our associates or agents could damage our reputation in the United States and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that
could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits.
16
Failure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks, formulae and other intellectual property rights could harm our business.
Our trademarks, formulae and other intellectual property rights (refer to the heading "Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks" in "Item 1. Business" above) are essential to the
success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal
protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or
remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third
parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.
Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products.
The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a
temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods.
Climate change may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause
significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a
result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are
important sources of ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Climate change may also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further
deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the Coca-Cola system's bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather
conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse
impact on our business and results of operations.
If negative publicity, even if unwarranted, related to product safety or quality, human and workplace rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image and corporate reputation, our
business may suffer.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build up brand image for new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate
reputation. We cannot assure you, however, that our continuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety and quality and human rights will have
the desired impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or
unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or "spurious"
products, which we and our bottling partners may not be able to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and our executives
engage in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the Company. These
engagements in public policy debates can occasionally be the subject of backlash from advocacy groups that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer
reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships could subject us to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities
associated with organizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our bottling system or supply chain, with
human and workplace rights issues could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Furthermore, in June 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council endorsed the Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights, which outlines how businesses should implement the corporate responsibility to respect human rights principles included in the United Nations
"Protect, Respect and Remedy" framework on human rights. Through our Human Rights Policy, Code of Business Conduct and Supplier Guiding Principles, and our participation in the United
Nations Global Compact, as well as our active participation in the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights, we made a number of commitments to respect all human rights. Allegations,
even if untrue, that we are not respecting one or more of the 30 human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers
or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; and adverse
publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could negatively affect our Company's overall
reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers. In addition, if we fail to protect our associates’ and our supply chain
employees’ human rights, or inadvertently discriminate against any group of associates or hiring prospects, our ability to hire and retain the best talent will be diminished, which could have an
adverse impact on our overall business.
17
Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.
Our Company's business is subject to various laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to
competition, product safety, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling and product stewardship, the protection of the environment, and employment and labor practices. In the
United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and sale of our products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the
Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local
environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations,
as well as other legal and regulatory requirements. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, or regulations to limit or eliminate the use of BPA, or regulations to limit or impose additional costs on
commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which
could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. In addition, failure to comply with
environmental, health or safety requirements, U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages, the
imposition of penalties, suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or a cessation or interruption of operations at our or
our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.
Changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results.
New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to our Company from time to time, or changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements, could
have a significant effect on our reported financial results for the affected periods.
If we are not able to achieve our overall long-term growth objectives, the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected.
We have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives. These objectives were based on, among other things, our evaluation of our growth prospects, which are
generally driven by the sales potential of our many beverage products, some of which are more profitable than others, and on an assessment of the potential price and product mix. There can be
no assurance that we will realize the sales potential and the price and product mix necessary to achieve our long-term growth objectives.
If global credit market conditions deteriorate, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
The cost and availability of credit vary by market and are subject to changes in the global or regional economic environment. If conditions in major credit markets deteriorate, our and our
bottling partners' ability to obtain debt financing on favorable terms may be negatively affected, which could affect our and our bottling partners' profitability as well as our share of the income
of bottling partners in which we have equity method investments. A decrease in availability of consumer credit resulting from unfavorable credit market conditions, as well as general
unfavorable economic conditions, may also cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending, which could reduce the demand for our beverages and negatively affect our and our bottling
partners' financial performance.
Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.
As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and
swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial
institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may
be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover
losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws
governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default by or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact
our results of operations and financial condition.
18
If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could
suffer.
Many of our associates at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective
bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with associates and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be
challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our associates. If we are unable to renew collective
bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor
unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations' or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to
supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to
customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity. Restructuring activities and the
announcement of plans for future restructuring activities may result in a general increase in insecurity among some Company associates and some employees in other parts of the Coca-Cola
system, which may have negative implications on employee morale, work performance, escalation of grievances and successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. If these labor
relations are not effectively managed at the local level, they could escalate in the form of corporate campaigns supported by the labor organizations and could negatively affect our Company's
overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products' acceptance by consumers.
We may be required to recognize impairment charges that could materially affect our financial results.
We assess our trademarks, bottler franchise rights, goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our other long-lived assets as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States to determine whether they are impaired and, if they are, we record appropriate impairment charges. Our equity method investees also perform impairment tests, and we
record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by them adjusted, as appropriate, for the impact of items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. It is
possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges or our proportionate share of significant impairment charges recorded by equity method investees in the future and, if
we do so, our operating or equity income could be materially adversely affected.
We may incur multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities in the future, which could negatively impact our financial performance.
We participate in certain multi-employer pension plans in the United States. Our U.S. multi-employer pension plan expense totaled 
$41 million
 in 2016. The U.S. multi-employer pension plans
in which we currently participate have contractual arrangements that extend into 2021. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from any of the multi-employer pension plans in which we
currently participate, we would need to record the appropriate withdrawal liabilities at that time, which could negatively impact our financial performance in the applicable periods.
If we do not successfully integrate and manage our Company-owned or -controlled bottling operations or other acquired businesses or brands, our results could suffer.
From time to time we acquire or take control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. In
addition, we routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in
connection with acquiring, taking control of or managing acquired bottling operations, other businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in restructuring and
integrating them into our Company's operating and internal control structures. We may also experience delays in extending our Company's internal control over financial reporting to newly
acquired or controlled bottling operations or other businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial
statements. Our financial performance depends in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of Company-owned or -controlled bottling operations and other acquired
businesses or brands. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for such bottling operations or other acquisitions. If we are unable to
achieve such objectives, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.
19
If we do not successfully manage our refranchising activities, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
As part of our strategic initiative to refocus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, we are refranchising Company-owned or -controlled bottling
operations in North America and China. In addition, in December 2016, we announced that we reached an agreement regarding the transition of Anheuser-Busch InBev’s ("ABI") controlling
interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited ("CCBA") and our intention to hold CCBA’s territories temporarily until they can be refranchised to other partners. For more
information regarding this transaction, refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report.
Our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may become a distraction for, senior management. In addition, in connection with refranchising
transactions in North America, we recorded, and we expect will continue to record, losses primarily related to the derecognition of intangible assets transferred or that will be transferred to
bottling partners. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete refranchising transactions on our expected timetable and on terms and conditions favorable to us; that our refranchising
bottling or joint venture partners will be efficient and aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system; or that we will be able to maintain good relationships with the refranchised
bottling operations. If we are unable to complete contemplated refranchising transactions timely, on favorable terms and with partners who share our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system,
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
If we do not realize the economic benefits we anticipate from our productivity initiatives or are unable to successfully manage their possible negative consequences, our business
operations could be adversely affected.
We believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement the most effective
and efficient business model possible. For information regarding our productivity initiatives, refer to the heading "Operations Review — Other Operating Charges — Productivity and
Reinvestment Program" set forth in Part II, "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this report. We have incurred, and we expect
will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses with the programs and activities associated with our productivity initiatives. If we are unable to implement some or all of these actions fully
or in the envisioned timeframe, or we otherwise do not timely capture the efficiencies, cost savings and revenue growth opportunities we anticipate from these actions, our results of operations
for future periods could be negatively affected. In addition, some of the actions we are taking in furtherance of our productivity initiatives may become a distraction for our managers and
employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee morale which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and
employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and give rise to negative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation. If we are unable
to successfully manage the possible negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.
If we fail to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our strategic relationship with Monster, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
In August 2014, we entered into definitive agreements with Monster for a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category, and upon the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the agreements in June 2015 we purchased newly issued shares representing approximately 17 percent of Monster’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock (after
giving effect to the issuance). (For more information regarding our agreements with Monster and related transactions, refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in
Part II, "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report.) If we are unable to successfully manage our complex relationship with Monster, or if for any other reason we fail
to realize all or a significant part of the benefits we expect from this strategic relationship and the related investment, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
If we are unable to attract or retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, our business could be negatively affected.
The success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. We may not be able to successfully compete for and attract the
high-quality and diverse employee talent we want and our future business needs may require. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or
relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, the unexpected loss of experienced and highly skilled associates due to
insecurity resulting from our ongoing productivity initiatives, refranchising transactions and organizational changes could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our
competitiveness. Any of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business.
20
Global or regional catastrophic events, including terrorist acts, cyber-strikes and radiological attacks, could impact our operations and financial results.
Because of our global presence and worldwide operations, our business can be affected by large-scale terrorist acts, cyber-strikes and radiological attacks, especially those directed against the
United States or other major industrialized countries; the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; major natural disasters; or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. Such events could
impair our ability to manage our business around the world, could disrupt our supply of raw materials and ingredients, and could impact production, transportation and delivery of concentrates,
syrups and finished products. In addition, such events could cause disruption of regional or global economic activity, which can affect consumers' purchasing power in the affected areas and,
therefore, reduce demand for our products.

Management believes that our Company's facilities for the production of our products are suitable and adequate, that they are being appropriately utilized in line with past experience, and that
they have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes. The extent of utilization of such facilities varies based upon seasonal demand for our products. However,
management believes that additional production can be achieved at the existing facilities by adding personnel and capital equipment and, at some facilities, by adding shifts of personnel or
expanding the facilities. We continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, on the basis of that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or
dispose of existing facilities.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. Management believes that the total liabilities to the Company that may arise as a
result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.
Aqua-Chem Litigation
On December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (
The Coca-Cola Company v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., Civil Action No. 2002CV631-50
) in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia
("Georgia Case"), seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company has no obligation to its former subsidiary, Aqua-Chem, Inc., now known as Cleaver-Brooks, Inc. ("Aqua-Chem"), for any
past, present or future liabilities or expenses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua-Chem. Subsequent to the Company's filing but on the same day, Aqua-Chem filed a lawsuit
(
Aqua-Chem, Inc. v. The Coca-Cola Company, Civil Action No. 02CV012179
) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin ("Wisconsin Case"). In the Wisconsin Case,
Aqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not covered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem's general and
product liability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Company's sale of Aqua-Chem in 1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million for costs incurred
by Aqua-Chem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case initially was stayed, pending final resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without
prejudice by Aqua-Chem.
The Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance coverage, which also insures Aqua-Chem for some of its prior
and future costs for certain product liability and other claims. The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of a stock sale agreement. The 1981
agreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties' rights and obligations concerning past and future claims and lawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a
division of Aqua-Chem, manufactured boilers, some of which contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has
approximately 40,000 active claims pending against it.
The parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-Chem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the coverage action, five
plaintiff insurance companies filed suit (
Century Indemnity Company, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852
) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of
Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the policies that were the subject of the coverage action had been issued to the
Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination of the respective rights and obligations under the insurance policies
issued with regard to asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem. The action also sought a monetary judgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two
of the insurers, one with a $15 million policy limit and one with a $25 million policy limit, asserted cross-claims against the Company, alleging that the Company and/or its insurers are
responsible for Aqua-Chem's asbestos liabilities before any obligation is triggered on the part of the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies.
Aqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the insurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were jointly and severally
liable for coverage amounts, but reserving judgment on other defenses that might apply. During the course of the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation, Aqua-Chem and the Company
reached settlements with several of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who paid funds into escrow accounts for payment of costs arising from the asbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. On July
24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under the insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant
insurers, which judgment was not appealed. The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer whose policy is triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua-Chem's
losses up to policy limits. The court's judgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.
The Company and Aqua-Chem continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem with those insurance companies that did not settle in the
Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. The Company anticipated that a final settlement with three of those insurers ("Chartis insurers") would be finalized in May 2011, but the Chartis
insurers repudiated their settlement commitments and, as a result, Aqua-Chem and the Company filed suit against them in Wisconsin state court to enforce the coverage-in-place settlement or,
in the alternative, to obtain a declaratory judgment validating Aqua-Chem and the Company's interpretation of the court's judgment in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.
22
In February 2012, the parties filed and argued a number of cross-motions for summary judgment related to the issues of the enforceability of the settlement agreement and the exhaustion of
policies underlying those of the Chartis insurers. The court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment that the 2011 Settlement Agreement and 2010 Term Sheet were not binding
contracts, but denied their similar motions related to plaintiffs' claims for promissory and/or equitable estoppel. On or about May 15, 2012, the parties entered into a mutually agreeable
settlement/stipulation resolving two major issues: exhaustion of underlying coverage and control of defense. On or about January 10, 2013, the parties reached a settlement of the estoppel
claims and all of the remaining coverage issues, with the exception of one disputed issue relating to the scope of the Chartis insurers' defense obligations in two policy years. The trial court
granted summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem on that one open issue and entered a final appealable judgment to that effect following the parties' settlement. On January
23, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a notice of appeal of the trial court's summary judgment ruling. On October 29, 2013, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary
judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem. On November 27, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and on December 11, 2013, the
Company filed its opposition to that petition. On April 16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin denied the Chartis insurers' petition for review.
The Georgia Case remains subject to the stay agreed to in 2004.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute
On September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency ("Notice") from the IRS for the tax years 2007 through 2009, after a five-year audit. In the Notice, the IRS
claims that the Company's United States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for the
period, plus interest. No penalties were asserted in the Notice. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer pricing matter involving the appropriate amount of taxable income the Company
should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to certain related foreign licensees regarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and
promotion of products in overseas markets.
The Company has followed the same transfer pricing methodology for these licenses since the methodology was agreed with the IRS in a 1996 closing agreement that applied back to 1987. The
closing agreement provides prospective penalty protection as long as the Company follows the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant Federal tax law have
not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company, without further explanation, that the IRS has determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant Federal tax law
have changed and that it may assert penalties. The Company does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the
IRS in five successive audit cycles covering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.
The Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. To the extent the
matter remains designated, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and Mutual Agreement Program.
The Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To that end, the
Company filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court on December 14, 2015, and the IRS filed its answer on February 12, 2016. A trial date has been set for March 5, 2018. The Company intends to
vigorously defend its position and is confident in its ability to prevail on the merits.

Our Business
General
The Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company. We own or license and market more than 
500
 nonalcoholic beverage brands including sparkling beverages and a variety of
still beverages such as waters, flavored waters and enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, sports drinks, dairy, and energy drinks. We own and market 
four
 of
the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886,
are now sold in more than 
200
 countries.
29
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations, bottling
partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for more than 
1.9 billion
 of
the approximately 
59 billion
 servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.
We believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage choices to meet their desires, needs and lifestyle choices. Our
success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.
Our goal is to use our Company's assets — our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and
associates — to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners.
Our Company markets, manufactures and sells:
•
beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as "beverage bases," and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our "concentrate business" or
"concentrate operations"); and
•
finished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our "finished product business" or "finished product
operations").
Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.
In our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our
"bottlers" or our "bottling partners"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or combine the syrups
with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers — such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles —
bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell
concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and
convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to
fountain retailers.
Our finished product operations consist primarily of Company-owned or -controlled bottling, sales and distribution operations, including CCR's bottling and associated supply chain operations
in the United States and Canada, and are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages
and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers
and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience
stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain
retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment. We authorize these wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through nonexclusive appointments that
neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the United States.

The Nonalcoholic Beverage Segment of the Commercial Beverage Industry
We operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage
companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending,
economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climate, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency fluctuations, fuel prices and
weather patterns.
Our Objective
Our objective is to use our formidable assets — our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and
associates — to achieve long-term sustainable growth. Our vision for sustainable growth includes the following:
•
People: Being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can
be.
•
Portfolio: Bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies people's desires and
needs.
•
Partners: Nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual
loyalty.
•
Planet: Being a responsible global citizen that makes a
difference.
•
Profit: Maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall
responsibilities.
•
Productivity: Managing our people, time and money for greatest
effectiveness.
Strategic Priorities
We have five strategic priorities designed to help us achieve our objective. These strategic priorities are accelerating growth of a consumer-centric brand portfolio; driving revenue growth, led
by sparkling beverages; strengthening the Coca-Cola system; digitizing the enterprise; and unlocking the power of our people. In order to execute on these strategic priorities, we must further
enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing, commercial leadership and franchise leadership.
Core Capabilities
Consumer Marketing
Marketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of, and increase consumer preference for, our brands. Successful marketing investments produce long-term growth in unit
case volume, per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales. Through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the
marketplace, we create and implement integrated marketing programs, both globally and locally, that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands. In
developing a strategy for a Company brand, we conduct product and packaging research, establish brand positioning, develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback.
Our integrated marketing activities include, but are not limited to, advertising, point-of-sale merchandising and sales promotions.
We are focusing on marketing strategies to drive volume growth in emerging markets, increase our brand value in developing markets and grow net revenues and profit in our developed
markets. In emerging markets, we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers. In developing markets, where consumer access has largely
been established, our focus is on differentiating our brands. In our developed markets, we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs but generally at a slower rate than gross
profit growth.
31
Commercial Leadership
The Coca-Cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers. We focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions
to grow their beverage businesses. Our approach includes understanding each customer's business and needs — whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk
owner in an emerging market. We focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves
and the Company. We are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers' outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences, product availability
and delivery systems, and beverage merchandising and displays. We participate in joint brand-building initiatives with our customers in order to drive consumer preference for our brands.
Through our commercial leadership initiatives, we embed ourselves further into our retail customers' businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale.
Franchise Leadership
We must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our Company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values, aligned incentives and a
sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers' always changing needs and tastes. The financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the Company's
success. We work with our bottling partners to identify processes that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies, and we share best practices throughout the bottling system. With our
bottling partners, we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers. We also design business models for sparkling and still
beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these beverages with our bottling partners. We will continue to build a supply chain network that
leverages the size and scale of the Coca-Cola system to gain a competitive advantage.
Challenges and Risks
Being global provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the
attention of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and our Company. Of these, six key challenges and risks are discussed below.
Obesity
The rates of obesity affecting communities, cultures and countries worldwide continue to be too high. There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government
agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. This concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. We understand and recognize that obesity is a complex public health
challenge and are committed to being a part of the solution.
We recognize the uniqueness of consumers' lifestyles and dietary choices. Commercially, we continue to:
•
offer reduced-, low- or no-calorie beverage
options;
•
provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of all of our
packages;
•
provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes;
and
•
market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under
12.
The heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering to find winning solutions in
the area of noncaloric sweeteners. This includes working to reduce sugar and calories in many of our beverages. We want to be a more helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity.
Across the Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action.
Water Quality and Quantity
Water quality and quantity is an issue that requires our Company's sustained attention and collaboration with other companies, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations and
communities where we operate. Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed
in our manufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Water is a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation,
increased food demand, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change.
32
Our Company regularly assesses the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and has implemented a formal water risk management program. Mitigation of
water risk forms the basis of our water stewardship strategic framework. This strategy is executed at the local level where we operate and includes the following elements: water use efficiency
and wastewater treatment in manufacturing operations; shared watershed protection efforts; engaging local communities; and addressing water resource management in our agricultural
ingredient supply chain. Such efforts are conducted in collaboration and partnership with others and are intended to help address local needs. Many of these efforts help us in achieving our goal
of replenishing the water that we and our bottling partners source and use in our finished products. We are also collaborating with other companies, governments, nongovernmental
organizations and communities to advocate for needed water policy reforms and action to protect water availability and quality around the world.
Through these integrated programs, we believe that our Company can leverage the water-related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve — through source water
availability assessments and planning, water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water
and sanitation needs. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect continued action on our part to help with the successful long-term stewardship of this critical
natural resource, both for our business and the communities we serve.
Evolving Consumer Preferences
We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles, aging populations and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence
of these changes, consumers want more choices. We are committed to meeting their needs and to generating new growth through our portfolio of more than 500 brands and nearly 3,900
beverage products, including nearly 1,200 low- and no-calorie products, new product offerings, innovative packaging and ingredient education efforts. We are also committed to continuing to
expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their ever-changing needs, desires and lifestyles.
Increased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace
Our Company is facing strong competition from some well-established global companies and many local participants. We must continue to strengthen our capabilities in marketing and
innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share while we strategically expand into other profitable categories of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial
beverage industry.
Product Safety and Quality
As the world's largest beverage company, we strive to meet the highest of standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative
viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our products. 
The Coca-Cola system works every day to share safe and refreshing beverages with the world. We have rigorous product and
ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage options to meet consumers' evolving
needs and preferences. Across the Coca-Cola system, we take great care in an effort to ensure that every one of our beverages meets the highest standards for safety and quality.
We work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. We stay current with new regulations, industry best
practices and marketplace conditions and engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products according to strict policies,
requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-Cola system against the same stringent
standards. Our quality management system also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality laboratories, we stringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as
well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace.
We perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries where our products are sold. We consistently reassess
the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain.
33
Food Security
Increased demand for commodities and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost
of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important sources of ingredients for our products and could impact the food security of
communities around the world. We are dedicated to implementing our sustainable sourcing commitment, which is founded on principles that protect the environment, uphold workplace rights
and help build more sustainable communities. To support this commitment, our programs focus on economic opportunity, with an emphasis on female farmers, and environmental sustainability
designed to help address these agricultural challenges. Through joint efforts with farmers, communities, bottlers, suppliers and key partners, as well as our increased and continued investment in
sustainable agriculture, we can together help make a positive strategic impact on food security.
All of these challenges and risks — obesity; water quality and quantity; evolving consumer preferences; increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace; product safety and quality;
and food security — have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and on our Company; however, we believe
our Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks.
See also ''Item 1A. Risk Factors'' in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the
following:
•
Principles of
Consolidation
•
Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent
Assets
•
Pension Plan
Valuations
•
Revenue
Recognition
•
Income
Taxes
Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. While our
estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions.
For a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to 
Note 1
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Principles of Consolidation
Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual
condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved
through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and
potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is
referred to as a "VIE." An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of
the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be
significant to the VIE.
Our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests
in these VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to 
Note 11
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial arrangements
resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Our
Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $
3,709 million
 and $
2,687 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively,
34
representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial
statements.
In addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. As a result,
we have consolidated these entities. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $
203 million
 and $
221 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
,
respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated
financial statements.
Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.
We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the
investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity
method investee includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany
transactions.
We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions
with equity method investees.
Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets
Our Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing and
emerging markets. Refer to the heading "Our Business — Challenges and Risks" above and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous
assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in various regions around the world.
We perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets,
recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least
annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.
Our equity method investees also perform such recoverability and/or impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company records its
proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our
proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.
Management's assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment,
include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the
asset, sales volume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from
the sale of assets. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of current and
noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions,
which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The
variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other
assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore,
we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in
future periods, future impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading "Operations Review" below for additional information related to our present business environment. Certain factors
discussed above are impacted by our current business environment and are discussed throughout this report, as appropriate.
35
Investments in Equity and Debt Securities
The carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method, the cost method or the fair value method. We account for investments in companies that we
do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable. Investments in equity securities, other than investments accounted for under
the equity method, are carried at fair value if the fair value of the security is readily determinable. Equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available-for-sale
securities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net
of deferred taxes, on available-for-sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), except for the
change in fair value attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which is included in net income. Trading securities are reported as either marketable securities or other assets in
our consolidated balance sheets. Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the
length of time we intend to hold the investment. Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting or equity method accounting are accounted for under the cost
method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. Cost method investments are
reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets.
Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or
available-for-sale.
The following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities (in millions):

Investments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We review our investments
in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity each reporting period to determine
whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the
fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair
values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies,
management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the
assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds
valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value.
In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the
decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and
the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period
of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

The carrying value of our investment in CCEP exceeded its fair value as of 
December 31, 2016
. Based on the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the
financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management
determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge.
Other Assets
Our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. Additionally, our Company advances
payments to certain customers for distribution rights as well as to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods
benefited. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported in the line items prepaid expenses and other assets or other assets, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance
sheets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets or asset groups may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by
preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the
expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by
which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.
Property, Plant and Equipment
As of 
December 31, 2016
, the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation, was $
10,635 million
, or 12 percent of our total assets. Certain events or changes in
circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, the manner or
length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period
operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and an impairment review is performed, we
estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our
internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment
loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including
appraisals and discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.
37
Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are classified into one of three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization
and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible
assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.

When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by
preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the
expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss
recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow
models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.
We test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances
indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting
impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical
marketplace participants would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount
equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The
Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform
the testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.
We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility,
which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as "business
units." These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic
location, including CCR's bottling and associated supply chain operations in the United States and Canada. Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling operation within our
Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.
The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We typically use
discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants
would use. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if
any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds
its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
38
The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the two-step process to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the two-step process. Otherwise,
the Company will forego the two-step process and does not need to perform any further testing. As of 
December 31, 2016
, we did not have any reporting unit with a material amount of
goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that it will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term.
Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and
macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the
impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also
negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. Additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a
hypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends,
regardless of whether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an
intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.
During 2016, the Company recorded charges of $153 million related to certain intangible assets. These charges included $143 million related to the impairment of certain U.S. bottlers'
franchise rights, primarily as a result of lower operating performance compared to previously modeled results as well as a revision in management's view of the proceeds that may be ultimately
received upon refranchising the territory. The remaining charge of $10 million was related to the impairment of goodwill and resulted from management's revised outlook on market conditions.
These impairment charges were recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income and were determined
by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets, derived using discounted cash flow analyses, to their respective carrying values.
During 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $55 million related to the impairment of a Venezuelan trademark. The Venezuelan trademark impairment was due to the Company's revised
expectations regarding the convertibility of the local currency. In 2015, the Company also closed a transaction with Monster. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company was required to
discontinue selling energy products under one of the trademarks included in the glacéau portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized impairment charges of
$418 million, primarily as a result of discontinuing these products. The charges for the impairment of these trademarks were recorded in our Corporate operating segment in the line item other
operating charges in our consolidated statement of income and were determined by comparing the fair value of the trademarks, derived using discounted cash flow analyses, to the respective
carrying values.
The Company did not record any significant impairment charges related to intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2014.
The total combined fair value of the various trademarks in the glacéau portfolio significantly exceeds the remaining combined carrying value of $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2016. However,
the fair value of the individual trademark that was the subject of the impairment charges discussed above only slightly exceeds its carrying value. If the future operating results of this trademark
do not support the current near-term financial projections, or if macroeconomic conditions change causing the cost of capital and/or discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the
operating results, it is likely that we would be required to recognize an additional impairment charge related to this trademark.
Pension Plan Valuations
Our Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified,
unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi-employer pension plans in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various
pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States.
39
Management is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and obligations. We believe the most critical assumptions are
related to (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. All of our actuarial assumptions are reviewed
annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expense and
obligations.
At each measurement date, we determine the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments we
anticipate making under the plans. As of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, the weighted-average discount rate used to compute our pension obligations was 
4.00 percent
 and 
4.25 percent
,
respectively.
Effective January 1, 2016, the Company changed its method of measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit
plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. The Company believes the approach adopted in 2016 provides a more precise measurement of
these components by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and the corresponding spot rates. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company's pension and other
postretirement benefit obligations for those plans. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, for plans using the yield curve approach, the Company measured the service cost and
interest cost components utilizing the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also
review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our long-term rates. Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all of our plans have sufficient funds to
meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted-
average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate our pension expense was 
8.25 percent
 in 2016 and 2015.
In 
2016
, the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was 
$238 million
, which primarily included $86 million of net periodic benefit cost and $155 million of settlement
charges and special termination benefit costs. In 2017, we expect our total pension expense to be $366 million, which includes $41 million of net periodic benefit cost and $325 million of
estimated settlement charges and special termination benefit costs expected to be incurred. The decrease in 2017 expected net periodic benefit cost is due to favorable asset performance in 2016
compared to our expected return, partially offset by a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the U.S. plans and a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate. The
estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate on our 2017 net periodic benefit cost would be an increase to our pension expense of $30 million. Additionally, the estimated
impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets on our 2017 net periodic benefit cost would be an increase to our pension expense of $29 million.
The sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. As of 
December 31, 2016
, the Company's primary U.S. plan
represented 
58 percent
 and 
61 percent
 of the Company's consolidated projected pension benefit obligation and pension assets, respectively. Refer to 
Note 13
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For
our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. Title usually transfers upon
shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any
manufacturing defects on our part.
Our customers can earn certain incentives which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income. These incentives
include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs. Refer to 
Note 1
 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure
programs, were $
6.6 billion
, $
6.8 billion
 and $
7.0 billion
 in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. In preparing the financial statements, management must make estimates related to the contractual
terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The
actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are recorded once they have been determined and have historically not been significant.
40
Income Taxes
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in
determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that
the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained,
but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating
whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, (2) the technical
merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of
the tax position, and (3) each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any
impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Refer to the heading "Operations Review — Income Taxes" below
and 
Note 14
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
On September 17, 2015, the Company received a Notice from the IRS for the tax years 2007 through 2009, after a five-year audit. In the Notice, the IRS claims that the Company's United
States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional federal income tax liability of approximately 
$3.3 billion
 for the period, plus interest. No penalties
were asserted in the Notice. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer pricing matter involving the appropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States
in connection with its licensing of intangible property to certain related foreign licensees regarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas
markets. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. The Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative
and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To that end, the Company filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court on December 14, 2015, and the IRS filed its answer on February 12,
2016. A trial date has been set for March 5, 2018. The Company believes that the final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, the additional tax, interest and any potential
penalties could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.
A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on
the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax
expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position,
amount, and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually
require the use of cash.
Tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate reflected in
our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our
tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted
tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits,
such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.
We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the
reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be
established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. As of 
December 31, 2016
,
the Company's valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $
530 million
 and were primarily related to uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss
carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow
us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate
character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a
41
reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our
consolidated balance sheet.
The Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign corporations to the extent that the basis difference
results from earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as
to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial
needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates
its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank
application and approval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. As of 
December 31, 2016
, undistributed earnings
of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that met the indefinite reversal criteria amounted to $
35.5 billion
. Refer to 
Note 14
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company's effective tax rate is expected to be 24.0 percent in 2017. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in 2017.
 
Operations Review
Our organizational structure as of 
December 31, 2016
 consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Bottling
Investments; and Corporate. For further information regarding our operating segments refer to 
Note 19
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands
In order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing
operations. In addition, we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key
metrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance.
Unit case volume growth is a metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case
volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers and,
therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume" below.
Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its
bottling partners or other customers. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume" below.
Our Bottling Investments operating segment and our other finished product operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages,
such as juices and juice drinks and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them
to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to
produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. For these consolidated finished
product operations, we recognize the associated concentrate sales volume at the time the unit case or unit case equivalent is sold to the customer. Our concentrate operations typically generate
net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations. For these concentrate operations, we recognize concentrate revenue and concentrate
sales volume when we sell concentrate to the authorized unconsolidated bottling and canning operations, and we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from
the concentrates and syrups are sold to the customer. When we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the following four factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales
volume or unit case volume, as appropriate), (2) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes defined below), as applicable, (3) changes in price, product and geographic mix and
(4) foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues" below.
42
We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling, distribution or canning operations and consolidation or 
deconsolidation of bottling and distribution entities for accounting
purposes as structural changes, which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures ("structural changes"). Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a
consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling
partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume
of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.
"Acquired brands" refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired
brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not
generally consider acquired brands to be structural changes.
"Licensed brands" refers to brands not owned by the Company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an
economic benefit when these brands are ultimately sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to these brands in periods
prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that the licenses are entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands
is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider newly licensed brands to be structural changes.
During 2016, the Company deconsolidated its South African bottling operations and disposed of its related equity method investment in exchange for equity method investments in CCBA and
CCBA's South African subsidiary. As part of the transaction, the Company also acquired and licensed several brands. The impacts of the deconsolidation, the disposal of the related equity
method investment and the new equity method investments have been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Europe,
Middle East and Africa and Bottling Investments operating segments and equity income on a consolidated basis as well as for our Bottling Investments operating segment. The brands and
licenses that the Company acquired impacted the Company’s unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and therefore, in addition to being included as a structural change, they are also
considered acquired brands. Refer to the headings "Beverage Volume" and "Net Operating Revenues" below.
Also in 2016, the Company deconsolidated our German bottling operations as a result of their being combined to create CCEP. As a result of the transaction, the Company now owns an equity
method investment in CCEP. Accordingly, the impact of the deconsolidation and new equity method investment has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating
revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Bottling Investments operating segments and equity income on a consolidated basis as well as for our
Bottling Investments operating segment. During 2016, the Company also changed our funding arrangement with our bottling partners in China, which resulted in a reduction in net operating
revenues with an offsetting reduction in direct marketing expense. The impact of the change in the arrangement has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues
on a consolidated basis as well as for our Asia Pacific operating segment. Refer to the headings "Beverage Volume" and "Net Operating Revenues" below.
Throughout 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company refranchised bottling territories in North America that were previously managed by CCR to certain of our unconsolidated bottling partners. The
impact of these refranchising activities has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our North America and Bottling
Investments operating segments. In addition, for non-Company-owned and licensed beverage products sold in the refranchised territories for which the Company no longer reports unit case
volume, we have eliminated the unit case volume from the applicable base year when calculating volume growth rates on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America and Bottling
Investments operating segments. Refer to the headings "Beverage Volume" and "Net Operating Revenues" below.
In 2015, the Company closed a transaction with Monster ("Monster Transaction"), which has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated
basis as well as for each of the Company's operating segments. This transaction consisted of multiple elements including, but not limited to, the acquisition of Monster’s non-energy brands and
the expansion of our distribution territories for Monster's energy brands. These elements of the transaction impacted the Company’s unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and
therefore, in addition to being included as a structural change, they are also considered acquired brands.
Also during 2015, the Company acquired a South African bottler, which has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for
the Bottling Investments operating segment. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues" below.
43
In 2014, the Company made a decision to change our process of buying and selling recyclable materials in North America. Also during 2014, the Company transitioned our Russian juice
operations to an existing joint venture with an unconsolidated bottling partner and acquired a majority interest in bottling operations in Sri Lanka and Nepal. The impact of these changes is
included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Bottling Investments operating segment. Refer to the heading "Net Operating
Revenues" below.
The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing
concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate
sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to
our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of
the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we
account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to these transactions until the equity method investee has sold
finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer.
The Company is currently pursuing certain transactions that, if completed, will be included as structural changes for the applicable periods. We intend to refranchise 100 percent of Company-
owned bottling operations in the United States by the end of 2017. The Company has entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of the Company-owned bottling operations in China to the
two existing franchise bottlers and to sell a related cost method investment to one of the franchise bottlers. The sale of the China bottling operations and cost method investment are subject to
various regulatory approvals and expected to close in the first half of 2017. Additionally, the Company has reached an agreement with ABI to transition its interest in CCBA and agreed in
principle to acquire ABI's interest in bottling operations in certain other countries. These transactions are subject to the relevant regulatory and minority shareholder approvals and are expected
to close by the end of 2017.
 
Beverage Volume
We measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, "unit case" means a unit of
measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and "unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company
beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks.
Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing
support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe
unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report
are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all instances
expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume
growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product
introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth
rates. In addition to the items mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest but to which the Company does not sell
concentrates or syrups may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.

Unit Case Volume
The Coca-Cola system sold 
29.3 billion
, 
29.2 billion
 and 
28.6 billion
 unit cases of our products in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. The unit case volume for 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflects the
impact of brands acquired and licensed during the applicable year. The unit case volume for 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflects the impact of the transfer of distribution rights with respect to non-
Company-owned brands that were previously licensed to us in North American bottling territories that have since been refranchised. The unit case volume in 2015 and 2014 reflects the
discontinuance of certain brands owned by our Russian juice company in connection with the transition in 2014 of our Russian juice operations to an existing joint venture with an
unconsolidated bottling partner (for information about these structural changes, refer to the heading "Operations Review — Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands"
above). The Company eliminated the unit case volume related to these structural changes from the base year, as applicable, when calculating 2016 versus 2015 and 2015 versus 2014 unit case
volume growth rates.
Sparkling beverages represented 72 percent, 73 percent and 73 percent of our worldwide unit case volume for 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 45
percent, 46 percent and 46 percent of our worldwide unit case volume for 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively.
In 
2016
, unit case volume in the United States represented 19 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume, 66 percent was attributable to sparkling
beverages and 34 percent to still beverages. Trademark 
Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume.
Unit case volume outside the United States represented 
81 percent
 of the Company's worldwide unit case volume for 
2016
. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case
volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and Japan, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 73 percent was
attributable to sparkling beverages and 27 percent to still beverages. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 46 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.
Year Ended
 
December 31, 2016
 versus 
Year Ended
 
December 31, 2015
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, unit case volume grew 1 percent, reflecting a 3 percent increase in still beverages and even volume in sparkling beverages. The group's sparkling beverage
performance included a 1 percent decline in Trademark 
Coca-Cola, offset by an increase of 4 percent in Trademark Sprite and an increase of 1 percent in Trademark Fanta. The increase in still
beverage volume reflected growth in packaged water, teas and sports drinks, partially offset by a decline in juices and juice drinks. The group reported increases in unit case volume in our
Western Europe, Middle East & North Africa, West Africa and South & East Africa business units. The increases in these business units were partially offset by declines in unit case volume in
both our Central & Eastern Europe and Turkey, Caucasus & Central Asia business units.
45
Unit case volume in Latin America decreased 1 percent, reflecting a decline of 2 percent in sparkling beverage volume partially offset by still beverage volume growth of 2 percent. The growth
in the group's still beverages was led by our performance in packaged water, teas and sports drinks. The group's volume reflected a decline of 7 percent in both the Brazil and Latin Center
business units and a decline of 3 percent in the South Latin business unit. These declines were partially offset by unit case volume growth of 5 percent in the Mexico business unit, which
reflected 6 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 4 percent growth in still beverages. Mexico's sparkling beverage unit case growth was led by 4 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola.
In North America, unit case volume grew 1 percent, reflecting even sparkling beverage volume and still beverage volume growth of 3 percent. North America's volume performance in
sparkling beverages included 3 percent growth in Trademark Sprite, 6 percent growth in Trademark Fanta and strong growth in energy drinks offset by a 5 percent decline in Diet Coke. The
increase in still beverage volume reflected growth in packaged water, sports drinks, juices and juice drinks and dairy. In addition, still beverage volume performance included 6 percent growth
in vitaminwater.
Unit case volume in Asia Pacific increased 2 percent. Sparkling beverage volume was even, which included 2 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola offset by a 4 percent decline in
Trademark Sprite. The group's still beverage volume increased 5 percent, reflecting growth in packaged water, teas and coffee, partially offset by a decline in juices and juice drinks. The
group's unit case volume reflected an increase of 6 percent in the ASEAN business unit and an increase of 3 percent in both the India & South West Asia and Japan business units. The growth
in these business units was partially offset by a unit case volume decline of 1 percent in the Greater China & Korea business unit.
Unit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 16 percent. This decrease primarily reflects the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations in May 2016, a decline in CCR's unit
case volume of 14 percent as well as a decline in China. The decline in CCR's unit case volume is primarily driven by North America refranchising activities. The unfavorable impact of these
items on the group's unit case volume results was partially offset by growth in India and other markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations. The Company's consolidated
bottling operations accounted for 33 percent and 67 percent of the unit case volume in China and India, respectively. CCR accounted for 51 percent of the total bottler-distributed unit case
volume in North America.
Year Ended
 
December 31, 2015
 versus 
Year Ended
 
December 31, 2014
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, unit case volume grew 3 percent, which consisted of 2 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 6 percent growth in still beverages. The group's sparkling
beverage growth included 2 percent growth in both Trademark Coca-Cola and Trademark Fanta. The growth in still beverages was led by packaged water, juices and juice drinks, teas and the
expansion of the innocent brand. Europe, Middle East and Africa benefited from unit case volume growth of 6 percent in the South & East Africa business unit and growth of 2 percent in both
the Middle East & North Africa and Central & Eastern Europe business units.
Unit case volume in Latin America grew 1 percent as a result of growth in still beverages of 4 percent and even sparkling beverage volume. The growth in still beverages was led by growth in
packaged water, juices and juice drinks, and sports drinks. The Latin Center and South Latin business units reported unit case volume growth of 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively. The
Mexico business unit reported unit case volume growth of 3 percent, reflecting growth in Trademark Coca-Cola of 3 percent. The growth in the Latin Center, South Latin and Mexico business
units was partially offset by a unit case volume decline of 4 percent in the Brazil business unit.
In North America, unit case volume grew 1 percent. This increase reflects 5 percent growth in still beverage volume and even sparkling beverage volume. The still beverage growth in the group
was led by 8 percent growth in packaged water and 6 percent growth in teas. After considering the impact of the acquired volume resulting from the Monster Transaction, North America unit
case volume growth remained 1 percent.
Unit case volume in Asia Pacific increased 4 percent, which consisted of 4 percent growth in both sparkling and still beverage volume. The sparkling beverage volume growth was led by a 5
percent increase in Trademark Coca-Cola, a 4 percent increase in Trademark Sprite and a 6 percent increase in Trademark Fanta. Still beverage volume growth was led by increases in packaged
water and teas of 12 percent and 6 percent, respectively. China's unit case volume grew 5 percent during the year, led by 12 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola and 3 percent growth in
Trademark Sprite. India reported unit case volume growth of 4 percent and Japan reported even volume.
Unit case volume for Bottling Investments was even, reflecting growth in China, India and Germany offset by a decline in CCR's unit case volume of 8 percent. The decline in CCR's unit case
volume is primarily driven by North America refranchising activities. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 34 percent, 69 percent and 100 percent of the unit case
volume in China, India and Germany, respectively. CCR accounted for 73 percent of the total bottler-distributed unit case volume in North America.
46
Concentrate Sales Volume
In 
2016
, worldwide unit case volume grew 1 percent and concentrate sales volume was even compared to 
2015
. In 
2015
, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew
2 percent compared to 
2014
. After considering the impact of structural changes, concentrate sales volume grew 1 percent during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain
joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, beverage bases or powders.

Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments (expressed in equivalent unit cases) after
considering the impact of structural changes. For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case
volume after considering the impact of structural changes. Our Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. Refer to the heading "Beverage
Volume" above.
Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume" above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volumes.
"Acquisitions and divestitures" refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. Refer to the heading "Structural
Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands" above for additional information related to the structural changes.
"Price, product and geographic mix" refers to the change in revenue caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold and the mix of channels and geographic
territories where the sales occurred.
Price, product and geographic m
ix had a favorable 3 percent impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and
events including, but not limited to, the following:
•
Europe, Middle East and Africa — favorable product and geographic
mix;
•
Latin America — favorable price mix in all four of the segment's business units and the impact of inflationary environments in certain markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic
mix;
•
North America — favorably impacted as a result of pricing initiatives and product and package mix;
and
•
Asia Pacific — unfavorable product and channel
mix.
The unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 3 percent. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar
compared to certain foreign currencies, including the South African rand, euro, U.K. pound sterling, Brazilian real, Argentine peso, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an
unfavorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar
compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a
favorable impact on our Asia Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — Foreign Exchange" below.
48
Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; acquisitions and divestitures; price, product and geographic mix; and foreign currency fluctuations. The size and timing of
acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. The Company currently expects acquisitions and divestitures to have an 18 percent to 19 percent unfavorable impact on full
year 2017 net operating revenues. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect currencies will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2017 net
operating revenues.
Year Ended

Price, product and geographic m
ix had a favorable 2 percent impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and
events including, but not limited to, the following:
•
Europe, Middle East and Africa — favorable price mix in most of the segment's business units, partially offset by unfavorable geographic
mix;
•
Latin America — favorable price mix in all four of the segment's business units and the impact of inflationary environments in certain

North America — favorably impacted as a result of price increases and package mix;
and
•

The percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating revenues in certain operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to other operating
segments. Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; acquisitions and divestitures; price, product and geographic mix; and foreign currency fluctuations. For additional
information about the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — Foreign Exchange" below.
 
Gross Profit Margin
As a result of our finished goods operations, which are primarily included in our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments, the following inputs represent a substantial
portion of the Company's total cost of goods sold: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The Company enters into hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to
mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity
exposures, including any related foreign currency exposure, do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments have been, and will
continue to be, included as a component of net income in each reporting period. The Company recorded gains related to these derivatives of 
$79 million
 during the year ended 
December 31,
2016
 and losses of 
$206 million
 and 
$8 million
 during the years ended 
December 31, 2015
 and 
2014
, respectively, in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income.
Refer to 
Note 5
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not currently expect changes in commodity costs to have a significant impact on our 2017 gross profit margin as
compared to 2016.
Year Ended
 
December 31, 2016
 versus 
Year Ended
 
December 31, 2015
Our gross profit margin increased to 60.7 percent in 2016 from 60.5 percent in 2015. The increase was primarily due to the impact of positive price mix and lower commodity costs, partially
offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information related to acquisitions and divestitures.
Year Ended

 versus 
Year Ended
 
December 31, 2014
Our gross profit margin decreased to 60.5 percent in 2015 from 61.1 percent in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the unfavorable impact of
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by positive price mix and slightly lower commodity costs. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1,165 million, or 7 percent. During the year ended December 31, 2016, fluctuations in foreign currency decreased selling, general and
administrative expenses by 2 percent. The increase in advertising expenses reflects the Company's increased investments to strengthen our brands, partially offset by a foreign currency
exchange impact of 3 percent. The decrease in selling and distribution expenses reflects the impact of divestitures. The decrease in other operating expenses reflects the shift of the Company's
marketing spending to more consumer-facing advertising expenses as well as savings from our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a
more significant impact on both advertising and other operating expenses as compared to our selling and distribution expenses since they are generally transacted in local currency. Our selling
and distribution expenses are primarily related to our Company-owned bottling operations, of which the majority of expenses are attributable to CCR and are primarily denominated in U.S.
dollars. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to divestitures.
In 
2016
, the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was 
$238 million
, which primarily included $86 million of net periodic benefit cost and $155 million of settlement
charges and special termination benefit costs. In 2017, we expect our total pension expense to be $366 million, which includes $41 million of net periodic benefit cost and $325 million of
estimated settlement charges and special termination benefit costs expected to be incurred. The decrease in 2017 expected net periodic benefit cost is due to favorable asset performance in 2016
compared to our expected return, partially offset by a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the U.S. plans and a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate. Refer to
the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position" below for information related to these contributions. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates —
Pension Plan Valuations" above and 
Note 13
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the pension plan assumptions used by the Company.
As of 
December 31, 2016
, we had $
267 million
 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under our plans. This cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.5 years
 as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based
compensation awards. Refer to 
Note 12
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Year Ended
 
December 31, 2015
 versus 
Year Ended
 
December 31, 2014
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $791 million, or 5 percent. During the year ended December 31, 2015, fluctuations in foreign currency decreased selling, general and
administrative expenses by 6 percent. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily due to reversals in 2014 of previously recognized expenses related to the Company's long-term
incentive programs as performance criteria were not achieved. The increase in advertising expenses reflects the Company's increased investments to strengthen our brands, partially offset by a
foreign currency exchange impact of 13 percent. The decrease in selling and distribution expenses reflects the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The decrease in other operating expenses
reflects the shift of the Company's marketing spending to more consumer-facing advertising expenses as well as savings from our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. Foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations have a more significant impact on both advertising and other operating expenses as compared to our selling and distribution expenses since they are generally
transacted in local currency. Our selling and distribution expenses are primarily related to our Company-owned bottling operations, of which the majority of expenses are attributable to CCR
and are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.

$352 million
 due to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program and
$240 million
 due to the integration of our German bottling operations. In addition, the Company recorded charges of 
$297 million
 related to costs incurred to refranchise certain of our bottling
operations. These costs include, among other items, internal and external costs for individuals directly working on the refranchising efforts, severance and costs associated with the
implementation of information technology systems to facilitate consistent data standards and availability throughout our bottling systems. Additionally, the Company recorded 
$118 million
 of
pension settlement charges primarily as a result of our refranchising activities. The Company also recorded a charge of 
$200 million
 related to cash contributions we made to The Coca-Cola
Foundation, a charge of

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company also recorded charges of 
$153 million
 related to certain intangible assets. These charges included 
$143 million
 related to the
impairment of certain U.S. bottlers' franchise rights recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment. This charge was related to a number of factors, primarily as a result of lower
operating performance compared to previously modeled results as well as a revision in management's view of the proceeds that may be ultimately received upon refranchising the territory. The
remaining charge of 
$10 million
 was related to the impairment of goodwill recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment. This charge was primarily the result of management's
revised outlook on market conditions. The total impairment charges of 
$153 million
 were recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment in the line item other operating charges in our
consolidated statement of income and were determined by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets, derived using discounted cash flow analyses, to their respective carrying values.

$601 million
 due to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program and
$208 million
 due to the integration of our German bottling operations. In addition, the Company incurred a charge of 
$314 million
 due to a write-down we recorded related to receivables from
our bottling partner in Venezuela and an impairment of a Venezuelan trademark primarily due to higher exchange rates. The write-down was recorded as a result of our revised assessment of
the U.S. dollar value we expect to realize upon the conversion of the Venezuelan bolivar into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our concentrate sales receivables. The Company also
recorded a loss of 
$36 million
 as a result of the restructuring and transition of the Company's Russian juice operations to an existing joint venture with an unconsolidated bottling partner. Refer

Productivity and Reinvestment Program
In February 2012, the Company announced a four-year productivity and reinvestment program designed to further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive
long-term profitable growth. This program is focused on the following initiatives: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage
and operational excellence; data and information technology systems standardization; and the integration of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s ("Old CCE") former North America business.
In February 2014, the Company announced the expansion of our productivity and reinvestment program to drive incremental productivity by 2016 that will primarily be redirected into
increased media investments. Our incremental productivity goal consists of two relatively equal components. First, we will expand savings through global supply chain optimization, data and
information technology systems standardization, and resource and cost reallocation. Second, we will increase the effectiveness of our marketing investments by transforming our marketing and
commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer-facing marketing investments to accelerate growth.
In October 2014, the Company announced that we were further expanding our productivity and reinvestment program and extending it through 2019. The expansion of the productivity
initiatives will focus on four key areas: restructuring the Company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget principles, across the organization;
streamlining and simplifying the Company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing investments. The Company expects that the expanded
productivity initiatives will generate an incremental $2 billion in annualized productivity. This productivity will enable the Company to fund marketing initiatives and innovation required to
deliver sustainable net revenue growth and will also support margin expansion and increased returns on invested capital over time. We expect to achieve total annualized productivity of
approximately $
3.6 billion
 by 2019 from the initiatives implemented under this program since it began in 2012 and have incurred total pretax expenses of $
2,408 million
 since the program
commenced. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Integration of Our German Bottling Operations
In 2008, the Company began the integration of our German bottling operations acquired in 2007. Since the integration commenced, the Company has incurred total pretax expenses of $
1,367
million
 primarily related to involuntary terminations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company deconsolidated our German bottling operations. Refer to

available-for-sale securities; and other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement
of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our
economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to 
Note 5
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2016, other income (loss) — net was a loss of 
$1,234 million
. This loss included losses of 
$2,456 million
 due to the refranchising of certain bottling territories in North America and a loss of
$21 million
 due to the deconsolidation of our South African bottling operations and disposal of the related equity method investment in exchange for investments in CCBA and CCBA's South
African subsidiary. The Company incurred charges of 
$31 million
 related to payments made to convert the bottling agreements for certain North America bottling partners' territories to a single
form of CBA with additional requirements. Additionally, the Company incurred net foreign currency exchange losses of $246 million, including a charge of 
$72 million
 as a result of
remeasuring its net monetary assets denominated in Egyptian pounds. The Egyptian pound devalued as a result of the central bank allowing its currency, which was previously pegged to the
U.S. dollar, to float freely. These losses were partially offset by a gain of 
$1,323 million
 due to the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations, dividend income of $55 million, net
gains of $83 million related to trading securities and available-for-sale securities and a gain of 
$18 million
 resulting from the Company's disposal of its investment in Keurig Green Mountain,
Inc. ("Keurig"). Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the North America refranchising, the deconsolidation of our South African bottling
operations, the conversion payments, the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations and the Keurig investment disposal. Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the impact these items had on our operating segments.
In 2015, other income (loss) — net was income of 
$631 million
. This income included a net gain of $1,403 million as a result the Monster Transaction, primarily due to the difference in the
recorded carrying value of the assets transferred, including an allocated portion of goodwill, compared to the value of the total assets and business acquired. Other income (loss) — net also
included net foreign currency exchange gains of $149 million and dividend income of $83 million. This income was partially offset by noncash losses of $1,006 million due to refranchising
activities in North America. The net foreign currency exchange gains included a gain of $300 million associated with our foreign-denominated debt partially offset by a charge of $27 million
due to the initial remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the SIMADI exchange rate. The Company determined that based on its economic circumstances,
the SIMADI rate best represented the applicable rate at which future transactions could be settled, including the payment of dividends. As such, the Company remeasured the net assets related
to its operations in Venezuela using the current SIMADI rate. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Monster Transaction and North
America refranchising. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — Foreign Exchange" below and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on the charge due to the change in Venezuelan exchange rates.
In 2014, other income (loss) — net was a loss of 
$1,263 million
, primarily due to noncash losses of 
$799 million
 related to the refranchising of certain bottling territories in North America and
net foreign currency exchange losses of $569 million, including a charge of $
372 million
 due to the remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the SICAD 2
exchange rate. These charges were partially offset by dividend income of $51 million and net gains of $45 million related to fluctuations in the carrying value of the Company's trading
securities and sales of available-for-sale securities. Refer to Note 1, 
Note 2
 and 
Note 17
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 
35.0 percent
. As
a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and
Swaziland. The terms of these grants expire from 
2017
 to 
2036
. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our
income tax expense by $
105 million
, $
223 million
 and $
265 million
 for the years ended 
December 31, 2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits
of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate.

As of 
December 31, 2016
, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $
302 million
. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of
$
179 million
, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $
123 million
, which was recorded as a deferred tax asset, primarily represents tax benefits that would be
received in different tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.

The increase is primarily related to a change in judgment about one of the Company’s tax positions as a result of receiving notification of a preliminary settlement of a Competent Authority matter with a
foreign jurisdiction, a portion of which became certain later in the year. This change in position did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statement of income during the year ended
December 31, 2016, as it was partially offset by refunds to be received from the foreign jurisdiction.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had $
142 million
, $
111 million
 and $
113 million
 in interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of 
December 31, 2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. Of these amounts, 
$31 million
 and $
8 million
 of expense were recognized
through income tax expense in 2016 and 
2014
, respectively. An insignificant amount of interest and penalties were recognized through income tax expense for the years ended December 31,
2016 and 2015. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.
Based on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2017 is expected to be 24.0 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate.
 
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position
We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Operating Activities" below. The
near-term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in 2017. As a result of our expected cash flows from operations, we have
significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of
capital and increase our return on shareowners' equity. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities" below. We have a history of borrowing funds domestically and continue to
have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates. In addition, our domestic entities have recently borrowed and continue to have the ability to borrow funds in
international markets at reasonable interest rates. Our debt financing includes the use of an extensive commercial paper program as part of our overall cash management strategy. The Company
reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new
issuances of long-term debt in the future. In addition to the Company's cash balances, commercial paper program, and our ability to issue long-term debt, we also had $
8,170 million
 in lines of
credit for general corporate purposes as of 
December 31, 2016
. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 
2017
 through 
2022
.
We have significant operations outside the United States. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 
81 percent
 of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2016. We earn a
substantial amount of our consolidated operating income and income before income taxes in foreign subsidiaries that either sell concentrate to our local bottling partners or, in certain instances,
sell finished products directly to our customers to fulfill the demand for Company beverage products outside the United States. A significant portion of these foreign earnings is considered to
be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our
international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes have been provided on the portion of our foreign earnings that is considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
jurisdictions. The Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $20.2 billion as of 
December 31, 2016
. With the
exception of an insignificant amount, for which U.S. federal and state income taxes have already been provided, we do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds.
59
Net operating revenues in the United States were $19.9 billion in 2016, or 48 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating revenues. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities, cash flows from operations and the issuance of debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments
for investing and financing activities. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable securities and cash flows from operations to continue to
be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities.
In the future, should we require more capital to fund significant discretionary activities in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of
domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This alternative could result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. While the likelihood is
remote, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in
the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various
foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. This alternative could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign
earnings. Refer to 
Note 14
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our income taxes and undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.
Based on all the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong, and we will continue to meet all of our financial commitments for the foreseeable future.
These obligations and anticipated cash outflows include, but are not limited to, regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, capital expenditures, share repurchases and obligations included
under the heading "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations" below.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for the

 and $
10,615 million
, respectively.
Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1,732 million, or 16 percent, in 
2016
 compared to 
2015
. This decrease included the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the
impact of $471 million in incremental contributions made to the Company's pension plans and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The impact of these items was partially offset by
lower income tax payments. Refer to the heading "Operations Review — Net Operating Revenues" above for additional information on the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to
Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax payments.
Cash flows from operating activities decreased $87 million, or 1 percent, in 
2015
 compared to 
2014
. This decrease primarily reflects the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and an increase
in tax payments, partially offset by the efficient management of working capital. Refer to the heading "Operations Review — Net Operating Revenues" above for additional information on the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax payments.

Debt Financing
Our Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of
capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.
As of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt was rated "AA-" by Standard & Poor's, "Aa3" by Moody's and "A+" by Fitch. Our commercial paper program was rated "A-1+" by Standard &
Poor's, "P-1" by Moody's and "F1" by Fitch. In assessing our credit strength, all three agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial
policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers,
including CCEP, Coca-Cola Amatil Limited, 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of
these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our
expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers'
financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or
62
for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the
potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.
We monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation
methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company.
Our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active
management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in
conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.
Issuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. In 2016, the Company had issuances of debt of 
$27,281 million
, which included net issuances of
$773 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and $21,525 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The
Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $4,983 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs. Refer below for additional details on our long-term debt
issuances.
During 2016, the Company made payments of debt of 
$25,615 million
, which included $22,920 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater
than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $2,695 million.
In 2015, the Company had issuances of debt of $40,434 million, which included net issuances of $25,923 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days.
The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $14,511 million, net of related discounts, premiums and issuance costs.
During 2015, the Company made payments of $37,738 million, which included net payments of $208 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less,
$31,711 million of payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt payments of $5,819 million. The long-term debt payments
included the extinguishment of 
$2,039 million
 of long-term debt prior to maturity, which resulted in associated charges of 
$320 million
 that were recorded in the line item interest expense in
our consolidated statement of income. These charges included the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt extinguished, including the impact of the
related fair value hedging relationship.
In 2014, the Company had issuances of debt of $41,674 million, which included net issuances of $317 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and
$37,799 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of
$3,558 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.
During 2014, the Company made payments of debt of $36,962 million, which included $35,921 million for payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90
days or less and long-term debt payments of $1,041 million.
The carrying value of the Company's long-term debt included fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from Old CCE of $
361 million
 and $
411 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and
2015
, respectively. These fair value adjustments are being amortized over the number of years remaining until the underlying debt matures. As of 
December 31, 2016
, the weighted-average
maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate was approximately 
21
 years. The amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in
future periods, which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to service the debt. Total interest paid was $
663 million
, $
515 million
 and $
498 million
in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt balances.
Issuances of Stock
The issuances of stock in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
 were related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees.

Share Repurchases
In 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 500 million shares of the Company's common stock. The table below presents annual shares repurchased and
average price per share:

Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of 
December 31, 2016
, we have purchased 3.4 billion shares of our Company's common
stock at an average price per share of $16.08. In addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity
also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock
options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. In 2016, we repurchased $3.7 billion of our stock. The net impact of the Company's treasury stock issuance and purchase
activities in 2016 resulted in a net cash outflow of $2.2 billion. We currently expect to repurchase approximately $2.0 billion of our stock during 2017, net of proceeds from the issuance of
treasury stock due to the exercise of employee stock options.
Dividends
The Company paid dividends of 
$6,043 million
, 
$5,741 million
 and 
$5,350 million
 during the years ended 
December 31, 2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively.
At its February 2017 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 6 percent, raising it to $0.37 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.48 per share in 2017.
This is our 55
th
 consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $
1.40
 per share, $
1.32
 per share and $
1.22
 per share in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. The 
2016
dividend represented a 6 percent increase from 
2015
, and the 
2015
 dividend represented an 8 percent increase from 
2014
.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:
•
any obligation under certain guarantee
contracts;
•
a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such
assets;
•
any obligation under certain derivative instruments;
and
•
any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the
registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant.
As of 
December 31, 2016
, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $
587 million
, of which $
247 million
 was related to VIEs. These guarantees are
primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various
terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees;
however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company
under these guarantees is not probable. As of 
December 31, 2016
, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in
assets as defined above.
Our Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to 
Note 5
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refer to 
Note 10
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short-term loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new
commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.
2
 
Refer to 
Note 10
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long-term debt. We will consider several alternatives to settle this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows
from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. The table above shows expected cash payments to be paid by the Company in future periods and excludes the
noncash portion of debt, including the fair market value mark up, unamortized discounts and premiums.
3
 
We calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the 
December 31, 2016
 rate for all years
presented. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings.
4
 
Refer to 
Note 14
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. As of 
December 31, 2016
, the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability, including accrued
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, was $439 million, which was not included in the total above. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax
liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions.
5
 
Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including long-term contractual obligations, open
purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities.
6
 
We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating
activities.
7
 
Represents liabilities of the Company's North America bottling territories and China bottling operations that are classified as held for
sale.
The total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of 
December 31, 2016
, was $2,336 million. Refer to 
Note 13
 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment
return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
We generally expect to fund all future pension contributions with cash flows from operating activities. Our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and
income tax regulations.
65
As of 
December 31, 2016
, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $6,531 million, and the fair value of the related plan assets was $6,061 million. The projected
benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was $2,897 million, and the fair value of the related plan assets was $2,310 million. The majority of this
underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non-U.S. employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions, as well as certain unfunded U.S. nonqualified pension
plans. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain associates, benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate annual benefit payments for these
unfunded pension plans to be $69 million in 2017, increasing to $76 million by 2024 and then decreasing annually thereafter. Refer to 
Note 13
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company expects to contribute 
$106 million
 in 2017 to our global pension plans, the majority of which will be allocated to our international plans. Refer to 
Note 13
 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our various plans in the table above.
In general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company's risk of
catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company's self-insured losses are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our
specific expectations based on our claim history. As of 
December 31, 2016
, our self-insurance reserves totaled $
527 million
. Refer to 
Note 11
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above.
Deferred income tax liabilities as of 
December 31, 2016
 were 
$4,445 million
. Refer to 
Note 14
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the total
contractual obligations table because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The
results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments
due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, the Company had entered into agreements related to the following future investing activities which are not included in the table above:
Under the terms of the agreement for our investment in CHI Limited, the Company is obligated to acquire the remaining ownership interest from the existing shareowners in 2019 based on an
agreed-upon formula.
Under the terms of agreements with certain of our unconsolidated bottling partners in the United States, the Company is obligated to make payments to each of these bottlers upon the
conversion of their bottling agreements to a comprehensive beverage agreement with additional requirements. We currently expect these conversions to occur during 2017.
The Company and ABI have reached an agreement regarding the transition of ABI's stake in CCBA for an equity value of 
$3,150 million
, after customary adjustments. The Company has also
agreed in principle to acquire ABI's interest in bottling operations in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, El Salvador and Honduras. The Company will negotiate the terms of
this transaction with ABI according to the contractual parameters. The transactions are subject to the relevant regulatory and minority approvals and are expected to close by the end of 2017.
Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements.

Foreign Exchange
Our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek
to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments, and to fluctuations in foreign currencies.
In 
2016
, we used 73 functional currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 
2016
, 
2015
 and
2014
, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened
(weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows:

These percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results.
Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share.
The total currency impacts on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, were decreases of 3 percent and 7 percent in 
2016
 and 
2015
, respectively. The total currency
impacts on income before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, were decreases of 12 percent in 2016 and 6 percent in 2015.
Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the
remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to 
Note 5
 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income (loss) — net in our consolidated financial statements.
Refer to the heading "Operations Review — Other Income (Loss) — Net" above. The Company recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $246 million in 
2016
, foreign currency exchange
gains of $149 million in 
2015
 and foreign currency exchange losses of $569 million in 
2014
.
Hyperinflationary Economies
A hyperinflationary economy is one that has cumulative inflation of 
100 percent
 or more over a three-year period. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, local subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies are required to use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in
U.S. dollars using the rate applicable to conversion of a currency for purposes of dividend remittances. All exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized currently in
income.
Venezuela has been designated as a hyperinflationary economy. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government recognized three legal exchange rates to convert bolivars to
the U.S. dollar: (1) the official rate of 
6.3
 bolivars per U.S. dollar; (2) SICAD 1, which was available to foreign investments and designated industry sectors to exchange a limited volume of
bolivars for U.S. dollars using a bid rate established at weekly auctions; and (3) SICAD 2, which applied to transactions that did not qualify for either the official rate or SICAD 1. As of March
28, 2014, the three legal exchange rates were 
6.3
 (official rate), 
10.8
 (SICAD 1) and 
50.9
 (SICAD 2). We determined that the SICAD 1 rate was the most appropriate rate to use for
remeasurement given our circumstances and estimates of the applicable rate at which future transactions could be settled, including the payment of dividends. Therefore, as of March 28, 2014,
we remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using an exchange rate of 
10.8
 bolivars per U.S. dollar, resulting in a charge of 
$226 million
 recorded in the line item other
income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.
67
In December 2014, due to the continued lack of liquidity and increasing economic uncertainty, the Company reevaluated the rate that should be used to remeasure the monetary assets and
liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2014, we determined that the SICAD 2 rate of 
50
 bolivars per U.S. dollar was the most appropriate legally available rate and
remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, resulting in a charge of 
$146 million
 recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of
income.
In February 2015, the Venezuelan government merged SICAD 1 and SICAD 2 into a single mechanism called SICAD and introduced a new open market exchange rate system, SIMADI. As a
result, management determined that the SIMADI rate was the most appropriate legally available rate and remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, resulting in a charge
of 
$27 million
 recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.
We also have certain U.S. dollar denominated intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. As a result of the Company's revised expectations regarding the convertibility of the
local currency, we recognized impairment charges of 
$55 million
 and 
$18 million
 during the years ended 
December 31, 2015
 and 
December 31, 2014
, respectively. These charges were recorded
in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income.
During the year ended 
December 31, 2016
, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and changed its official and most preferential exchange rate, which should be used for purchases
of certain essential goods, to 
10
 bolivars per U.S. dollar from 
6.3
. The official and most preferential rate is now known as DIPRO and the SICAD rate has been eliminated. The Venezuelan
government replaced the SIMADI rate with the DICOM rate, which is allowed to float freely and is expected to fluctuate based on supply and demand. As a result, management determined that
the DICOM rate was the most appropriate legally available rate to remeasure the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary.
In addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiary's net monetary assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the
country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During the years ended 
December 31, 2016
, 
December 31, 2015
 and 
December 31, 2014
, as a result of the continued lack of liquidity and
our revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to realize upon the conversion of Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our concentrate sales receivables,
we recorded write-downs of 
$76 million
, 
$56 million
 and 
$296 million
, respectively. 
These write-downs were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of
income.
As of 
December 31, 2016
, the combined carrying value of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, the receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela and the intangible assets
associated with products sold in Venezuela was 
$84 million
. The Company's ability to pay dividends from Venezuela is restricted due to the low volume of U.S. dollars available for conversion.
As a result of the floating DICOM rate, the Company expects to continue to record losses on foreign currency exchange, may incur additional write-downs of receivables or impairment charges
and will continue to record our proportionate share of any charges recorded by our equity method investee that has operations in Venezuela.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
Inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary
effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.

Includes a decrease in net assets of 
$626 million
 resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments in various balance sheet
accounts.
The increases (decreases) in the table above include the impact of the following transactions and events:
•
Assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale decreased primarily due to the deconsolidation of the Company's German and South African bottling operations which were previously
classified as held for sale, partially offset by the Company's China bottling operations and additional North America bottling territories being reclassified as held for sale. Refer to Note 2
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
•
Equity method investments increased primarily as a result of the Company's new investments in CCEP, CCBA and CCBA's South African subsidiary, partially offset by the
derecognition of the Company's former equity method investment in South Africa. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
•
Other investments decreased primarily due to the disposal of the Company's investment in Keurig, which was accounted for as an available-for-sale security. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
•
Property, plant and equipment and bottlers' franchise rights decreased primarily as a result of additional North America bottling territories being refranchised or reclassified as held for
sale as well as the Company's China bottling operations being reclassified as held for sale. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
•
Long-term debt increased due to the Company's recent issuances of Australian dollar-, euro- and U.S. dollar-denominated debt, partially offset by a portion of the Company's long-term
debt maturing within the next 12 months and being reclassified as current. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities" above for additional information.
•
Deferred income taxes decreased primarily due to the impact of refranchising certain bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other
market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying
economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal
changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The Company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to 36 months in advance; however, the majority of our derivative instruments expire
within 24 months or less. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.
We monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to 
Note 5
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative
financial instruments.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
We manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 
2016
, we used 73 functional
currencies and generated $21,964 million of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in
other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
Our Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options (principally euros and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and
liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $14,464 million and $18,060 million as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively. These values include derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of
$366 million as of 
December 31, 2016
. At the end of 
2016
, we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created a net
unrealized loss of $364 million. The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $208 million, and we estimate that a 10 percent
weakening of the U.S. dollar would have increased the net unrealized gain to $244 million.
Interest Rates
The Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term
debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Based on the Company's variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of 
December 31, 2016
, we estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased
interest expense by $227 million in 
2016
. However, this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income related to higher interest rates.
The Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the guidelines of the
Company's investment policy. Our policy requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. In addition, our policy limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $71 million decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly
liquid securities.
70
Commodity Prices
The Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels. We manage our exposure
to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution
business. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but
they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials used in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our
extensive vehicle fleet.
Open commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $12 million and $8 million as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively. The fair value of the contracts
that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $1 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in
underlying commodity prices, would have increased the net unrealized loss to $2 million.
Open commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $447 million and $893 million as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively. The fair value of
the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $11 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a
10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created a net unrealized loss of $28 million.

the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886,
are now sold in more than 
200
 countries.
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations, as well as
independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for
more than 
1.9 billion
 of the approximately 
59 billion
 servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.
Our Company markets, manufactures and sells:
•
beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as "beverage bases," and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our "concentrate business" or
"concentrate operations"); and
•
finished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our "finished product business" or "finished product
operations").
Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.
In our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our
"bottlers" or our "bottling partners"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or combine the syrups
with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers — such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles —
bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us  and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell
concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and
convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to
fountain retailers.
Our finished product operations consist primarily of Company-owned or -controlled bottling, sales and distribution operations, including Coca-Cola Refreshments' ("CCR") bottling and
associated supply chain operations in the United States and Canada, and are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. Our finished product operations generate net operating
revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to
retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers,
such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell
the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment. We authorize these wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through
nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the
United States.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of our consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future,
actual results may ultimately differ from these
78
estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges
may result.
Certain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual
condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved
through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and
potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is
referred to as a "VIE." An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of
the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be
significant to the VIE.
Our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests
in these VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to 
Note 11
. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these
entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees,
related to these VIEs totaled $
3,709 million
 and $
2,687 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments, plus
any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. As a result,
we have consolidated these entities. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $
203 million
 and $
221 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
,
respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated
financial statements.
Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.
We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the
investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity
method investee includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany
transactions.
We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions
with equity method investees.
Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale
Our Company classifies long-lived assets or disposal groups to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve
the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group; the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and
customary for sales of such assets or disposal groups; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset or disposal group have been initiated;
the sale of the asset or disposal group is probable, and transfer of the asset or disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or
circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the asset or disposal group beyond one year; the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price
that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be
withdrawn.
79
We initially measure a long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this
measurement is recognized in the period in which the held-for-sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset or disposal group until the date of sale.
We assess the fair value of a long-lived asset or disposal group less any costs to sell each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and report any subsequent changes as an
adjustment to the carrying value of the asset or disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the asset at the time it was initially classified as held for
sale.
Upon determining that a long-lived asset or disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation and reports long-lived assets and/or the assets
and liabilities of the disposal group, if material, in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 2.
Revenue Recognition
Our Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. In particular,
title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return
except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.
Deductions from Revenue
Our customers can earn certain incentives including, but not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for
infrastructure programs. The costs associated with these incentives are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income.
For customer incentives that must be earned, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts earned
and to be recorded in deductions from revenue. In making these estimates, management considers past results. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates.
In some situations, the Company may determine it to be advantageous to make advance payments to specific customers to fund certain marketing activities intended to generate profitable
volume and/or invest in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. The Company also makes advance
payments to certain customers for distribution rights. The advance payments made to customers are initially capitalized and included in our consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses and
other assets and noncurrent other assets, depending on the duration of the agreements. The assets are amortized over the applicable periods and included in deductions from revenue. The
duration of these agreements typically range up to 
10
 years.
Amortization expense for infrastructure programs was $
45 million
, $
61 million
 and $
72 million
 in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the
Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were $
6.6 billion
, $
6.8 billion
 and $
7.0 billion
 in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively.
Advertising Costs
Our Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures are expensed in
the annual period in which the expenditure is incurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income were
$
4.0 billion
 in both 
2016
 and 
2015
 and $
3.5 billion
 in 
2014
. As of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, advertising and production costs of $
113 million
 and $
207 million
, respectively, were primarily
recorded in the line item prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
For interim reporting purposes, we allocate our estimated full year marketing expenditures that benefit multiple interim periods to each of our interim reporting periods. We use the proportion
of each interim period's actual unit case volume to the estimated full year unit case volume as the basis for the allocation. This methodology results in our marketing expenditures being
recognized at a standard rate per unit case. At the end of each interim reporting period, we review our estimated full year unit case volume and our estimated full year marketing expenditures in
order to evaluate if a change in estimate is necessary. The impact of any changes in these full year estimates is recognized in the interim period in which the change in estimate occurs. Our full
year marketing expenditures are not impacted by this interim accounting policy.
80
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs related to the movement of finished goods from manufacturing locations to our sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold in our
consolidated statements of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move finished goods from our sales distribution centers to customer locations are included in the line item selling,
general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. During the 
years ended
 
December 31, 2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, the Company recorded shipping and handling costs
of $
2.0 billion
, $
2.5 billion
 and 
$2.7 billion
, respectively, in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses. Our customers do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs
related to finished goods.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is
computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Approximately 
51 million
, 
27 million
 and
38 million
 stock option awards were excluded from the computations of diluted net income per share in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively, because the awards would have been antidilutive for
the years presented.
Cash Equivalents
We classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of 
three
 months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents. We manage our exposure to
counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our credit risk concentrations.
Short-Term Investments
We classify time deposits and other investments that have maturities of greater than 
three
 months but less than 
one
 year as short-term investments.
Investments in Equity and Debt Securities
We use the equity method to account for our investments in equity securities if our investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the
investee. We include our proportionate share of earnings and/or losses of our equity method investees in equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income. The carrying
value of our equity investments is reported in equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to 
Note 6
.
We account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable. Investments in equity
securities, other than investments accounted for under the equity method, are carried at fair value if the fair value of the security is readily determinable. Equity investments carried at fair value
are classified as either trading or available-for-sale securities with their cost basis determined by the specific identification method. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities
and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred
taxes, on available-for-sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), except for the change in fair
value attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which is included in other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income. Trading securities are reported as
either marketable securities or other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported as either marketable securities, other investments or other
assets in our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment. Refer to 
Note 3
.
Investments in equity securities that we do not control or account for under the equity method and do not have readily determinable fair values for are accounted for under the cost method. Cost
method investments are originally recorded at cost, and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our
consolidated balance sheets, and dividend income from cost method investments is reported in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income.
Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or
available-for-sale.
81
Each reporting period we review all of our investments in equity and debt securities, except for those classified as trading, to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances
has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment.
We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our investments in publicly traded
companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation
methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants
would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies.
In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the
decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and
the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a
period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
Trade Accounts Receivable
We record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade
accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs, the level of past-due accounts based on the
contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and the economic status of, our bottling partners and customers. We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is
limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows (in millions):

The increases in 2016 and 2014 were primarily related to concentrate sales receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela. See Hyperinflationary Economies discussion below for additional
information.

 Other includes foreign currency translation adjustments and the impact of reclassifying certain assets to assets held for sale. See Note 2.
A significant portion of our net operating revenues and corresponding accounts receivable is derived from sales of our products in international markets. Refer to 
Note 19
. We also generate a
significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to bottlers in which we have a noncontrolling interest, including Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Coca-
Cola FEMSA"), Coca-Cola European Partners plc ("CCEP"), Coca-Cola HBC AG ("Coca-Cola Hellenic"), and 
Coca-Cola İçecek A.Ş. ("Coca-Cola İçecek"). Refer to 
Note 6
.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of raw materials and packaging (which includes ingredients and supplies) and finished goods (which include concentrates and syrups in our concentrate operations
and finished beverages in our finished product operations). Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. We determine cost on the basis of the average cost or first-in, first-out methods.
Refer to 
Note 4
.
Derivative Instruments
Our Company, when deemed appropriate, uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the
Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair value in our
consolidated balance sheets in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other assets; other assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other liabilities. The cash
flow impact of the Company's derivative instruments is primarily included in our consolidated statements of cash flows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer to 
Note 5
.
82
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded
principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following ranges: buildings and improvements:
40
 years or less; and machinery, equipment and vehicle fleet: 
20
 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life
of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to
generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense of assets under capital lease, totaled $
1,575 million
, $
1,735 million
 and $
1,716 million
 in 
2016
,
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements totaled $
22 million
, $
18 million
 and $
20 million
 in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively.
Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, a
significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or
projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual
disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges)
is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of
methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe
hypothetical marketplace participants would use. Refer to 
Note 7
.
Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets
We classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and
(3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when
determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, the Company's long-term strategy for using the asset, any
laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are
deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 
1
 to 
20
 years. Refer to 
Note 8
.
When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by
preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the
expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow
models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.
We test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances
indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting
impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical
marketplace participants would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount
equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The
Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform
the testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.
We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility,
which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as "business
units." These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic
location, including CCR's bottling and associated supply chain operations in the United States and Canada. Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling
83
operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each
business combination.
The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We typically use
discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants
would use. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if
any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds
its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the two-step process to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the two-step process. Otherwise,
the Company will forego the two-step process and does not need to perform any further testing.
Impairment charges related to intangible assets, including goodwill, are generally recorded in the line item other operating charges or, to the extent they relate to equity method investees, in the
line item equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income.
Contingencies
Our Company is involved in various legal proceedings and tax matters. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to,
court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or discloses the
relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Refer to 
Note 11
.
Stock-Based Compensation
Our Company sponsors equity plans that provide for the grant of awards including stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock and performance share units. The fair value of our stock
option grants is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the period the
grant is earned by the employee, generally 
four years
.
The fair value of our restricted stock units, restricted stock and certain performance share units is the quoted market value of the Company's stock on the grant date less the present value of the
expected dividends not received during the relevant period. For most performance share units granted beginning in 2014, the Company includes a relative total shareowner return ("TSR")
modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. For these awards, the number of shares earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined
performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies
falls outside of a defined range. The fair value of performance share units that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
In the period it becomes probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the performance share award will be achieved, we recognize expense for the proportionate share of the
total fair value of the award related to the vesting period that has already lapsed. The remaining fair value of the award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the balance of the vesting period.
In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance criteria specified in the award, we reverse all of the previously recognized
compensation expense in the period such a determination is made. Refer to 
Note 12
.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
Our Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified,
unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi-employer pension plans in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various
pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States. Refer to 
Note 13
.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes, plus a provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries not deemed to be indefinitely
reinvested. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of existing assets and
liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and manner in
84
which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The Company records
taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in our consolidated statements of income.
The Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax
positions at the time we determine that it becomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is
"more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was
originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge
of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their
applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions
taken. A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment is raised. The number of years subject to tax assessments
varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in
income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the
tax position, amount, and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Refer to Note 11 and 
Note 14
.
Translation and Remeasurement
We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars at the appropriate spot rates as of the balance sheet date. Generally,
our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. Changes in the carrying value of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in spot rates are recognized in
foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of AOCI. Refer to 
Note 15
. Income statement accounts are translated using the monthly average exchange rates during the year.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from a reporting entity's functional currency must first be remeasured from the applicable currency to the legal
entity's functional currency. The effect of this remeasurement process is recognized in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income and is partially offset by
the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to 
Note 5
.
Hyperinflationary Economies
A hyperinflationary economy is one that has cumulative inflation of 
100 percent
 or more over a three-year period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, local subsidiaries in hyperinflationary
economies are required to use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in U.S. dollars using the rate applicable to
conversion of a currency for purposes of dividend remittances. All exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized currently in income.
Venezuela has been designated as a hyperinflationary economy. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government recognized three legal exchange rates to convert bolivars to
the U.S. dollar: (1) the official rate of 
6.3
 bolivars per U.S. dollar; (2) SICAD 1, which was available to foreign investments and designated industry sectors to exchange a limited volume of
bolivars for U.S. dollars using a bid rate established at weekly auctions; and (3) SICAD 2, which applied to transactions that did not qualify for either the official rate or SICAD 1. As of March
28, 2014, the three legal exchange rates were 
6.3
 (official rate), 
10.8
 (SICAD 1) and 
50.9
 (SICAD 2). We determined that the SICAD 1 rate was the most appropriate rate to use for
remeasurement given our circumstances and estimates of the applicable rate at which future transactions could be settled, including the payment of dividends. Therefore, as of March 28, 2014,
we remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using an exchange rate of 
10.8
 bolivars per U.S. dollar, resulting in a charge of 
$226 million
 recorded in the line item other
income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.
In December 2014, due to the continued lack of liquidity and increasing economic uncertainty, the Company reevaluated the rate that should be used to remeasure the monetary assets and
liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2014, we determined that the SICAD 2 rate of 
50
 bolivars per U.S. dollar was the most appropriate legally available rate and
remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, resulting in a charge of 
$146 million
 recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of
income.
In February 2015, the Venezuelan government merged SICAD 1 and SICAD 2 into a single mechanism called SICAD and introduced a new open market exchange rate system, SIMADI. As a
result, management determined that the SIMADI rate was
85
the most appropriate legally available rate and remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, resulting in a charge of 
$27 million
 recorded in the line item other income
(loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.
We also have certain U.S. dollar denominated intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. As a result of the Company's revised expectations regarding the convertibility of the
local currency, we recognized impairment charges of 
$55 million
 and 
$18 million
 during the years ended 
December 31, 2015
 and 
December 31, 2014
, respectively. These charges were recorded
in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income.
During the year ended 
December 31, 2016
, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and changed its official and most preferential exchange rate, which should be used for purchases
of certain essential goods, to 
10
 bolivars per U.S. dollar from 
6.3
. The official and most preferential rate is now known as DIPRO and the SICAD rate has been eliminated. The Venezuelan
government replaced the SIMADI rate with the DICOM rate, which is allowed to float freely and is expected to fluctuate based on supply and demand. As a result, management determined that
the DICOM rate was the most appropriate legally available rate to remeasure the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary.
In addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiary's net monetary assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the
country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During the years ended 
December 31, 2016
, 
December 31, 2015
 and 
December 31, 2014
, as a result of the continued lack of liquidity and
our revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to realize upon the conversion of Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our concentrate sales receivables,
we recorded write-downs of 
$76 million
, 
$56 million
 and 
$296 million
, respectively. 
These write-downs were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of
income.
As of 
December 31, 2016
, the combined carrying value of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, the receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela and the intangible assets
associated with products sold in Venezuela was 
$84 million
. The Company's ability to pay dividends from Venezuela is restricted due to the low volume of U.S. dollars available for conversion.
As a result of the floating DICOM rate, the Company expects to continue to record losses on foreign currency exchange, may incur additional write-downs of receivables or impairment charges
and will continue to record our proportionate share of any charges recorded by our equity method investee that has operations in Venezuela.
Recently Issued Accounting Guidance
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, which will replace most
existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP and is intended to improve and converge with international standards the financial reporting requirements for revenue from contracts with
customers. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for
those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosures about the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including
significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU 2014-09 allows for adoption either on a full retrospective basis to each prior reporting period presented or on a modified retrospective
basis with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application, which will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018.
The Company plans to adopt ASU 2014-09 and its amendments on a modified retrospective basis and is continuing to assess all future impacts of the guidance by reviewing our current
contracts with customers to identify potential differences that could result from applying the new guidance. Based on our preliminary review, we expect that ASU 2014-09's broad definition of
variable consideration will require the Company to estimate and record certain variable payments resulting from collaborative funding arrangements, rebates and other pricing allowances
earlier than it currently does. While we do not expect this change to have a material impact on net revenues on an annual basis, we do expect that it will have an impact on our revenue in interim
periods. As we complete our overall assessment, the Company is also identifying and preparing to implement changes to our accounting policies and practices, business processes, systems and
controls to support the new revenue recognition and disclosure requirements. Our assessment will be completed during fiscal year 2017.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
. The amendments in this update simplify the presentation of
deferred income taxes and require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a consolidated statement of financial position. These amendments may be applied either
prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The amendments will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and we have
elected to adopt ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, 
Financial Instruments — Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
, which addresses certain
aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and will require us
to
86
recognize any changes in the fair value of certain equity investments in net income. These changes are currently recognized in other comprehensive income ("OCI").
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, 
Leases
, which requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset, representing their right to use the underlying asset for
the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing and
uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that
entities may elect to apply. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019 and we are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated
financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, 
Compensation — Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
.
 
The standard is intended to simplify
several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective
for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and will require us to prospectively recognize excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the consolidated statement of income when the awards vest
or are settled. These changes are currently recognized in capital surplus in our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the guidance requires excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating
activity in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments — Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
, which requires measurement and recognition of expected
credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020 and we are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on our
consolidated financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, 
Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory
, which requires the Company to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-
entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and will be applied using a modified
retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-16 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, 
Restricted Cash
. The amendments in this update address diversity in practice that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in
restricted cash and require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or
restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and is required to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-18 will have on our consolidated cash flows.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, 
Clarifying the Definition of a Business
, which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with
evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 is required to be applied prospectively and will be effective for the
Company beginning January 1, 2018. The impact on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the facts and circumstances of any specific future transactions.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, 
Intangibles — Goodwill and Other
, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill
impairment charge. ASU 2017-04 is required to be applied prospectively and the Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04 effective January 1, 2017. We do not anticipate that the
adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 
NOTE 2
: 
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
Acquisitions
During 
2016
, our Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled 
$838 million
, which primarily related to our acquisition of Xiamen
Culiangwang Beverage Technology Co., Ltd. ("China Green"), a maker of plant-based protein beverages in China, and a minority investment in CHI Limited ("CHI"), a Nigerian producer of
value-added dairy and juice beverages, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the terms of the agreement for our investment in CHI, the Company is obligated to
acquire the remaining ownership interest from the existing shareowners in 2019 based on an agreed-upon formula.
87
During 
2015
, our Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $
2,491 million
, which primarily related to our strategic partnership
with Monster Beverage Corporation ("Monster") and an investment in a bottling partner in Indonesia that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The bottling partner in
Indonesia is a subsidiary of Coca-Cola Amatil Limited, an equity method investee. We also acquired the remaining outstanding shares of a bottling partner in South Africa ("South African
bottler"), which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment. We remeasured our previously held equity interest in the South African bottler to fair value upon the close of the
transaction and recorded a loss on the remeasurement of 
$19 million
 during the year ended December 31, 2015. This bottler was deconsolidated in conjunction with the Coca-Cola Beverages
Africa Proprietary Limited transaction discussed further below.
During 
2014
, our Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $
389 million
, and primarily included a joint investment with one of our
bottling partners in a dairy company in Ecuador, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Monster Beverage Corporation
On August 14, 2014, the Company and Monster entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category. The transaction contemplated under
these agreements ("Monster Transaction") closed on June 12, 2015. As a result of the Monster Transaction, (1) the Company purchased newly issued shares of Monster common stock
representing approximately 
17 percent
 of the outstanding shares of Monster common stock (after giving effect to the new issuance); (2) the Company sold its global energy drink business
(including NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, Play and Power Play, and Relentless) to Monster, and the Company acquired Monster's non-energy drink business (including Hansen's Natural
Sodas, Peace Tea, Hubert's Lemonade and Hansen's Juice Products); and (3) the parties amended their distribution coordination agreements to expand distribution of Monster products into
additional territories pursuant to long-term agreements with the Company's existing network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling operations and independent distribution partners. The
Company and its bottling partners ("Coca-Cola system") also became Monster's preferred global distribution partner. The Company made a net cash payment of 
$2,150 million
 to Monster, of
which 
$125 million
 was being held in escrow, subject to release upon achievement of milestones relating to the transfer of Monster's domestic distribution rights to our distribution network. The
escrow was released in June 2016 upon the expiration of the escrow term as certain milestones relating to the transfer of Monster's domestic distribution rights to our distribution network had
not been achieved. However, due to the probability that these milestones will be achieved at a future date, the Company has accrued 
$125 million
 related to these future payments to Monster.
The Monster Transaction consisted of multiple elements including the purchase of common stock, the acquisition and divestiture of businesses and the expansion of distribution territories.
When consideration transferred is not solely in the form of cash, measurement is based on either the cost to the acquiring entity (the fair value of the assets given) or the fair value of the assets
acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus, more reliably measurable. As the majority of the consideration transferred was cash, we believe the fair value of the consideration
transferred is more reliably measurable. The consideration transferred consists of 
$2,150 million
 of cash (including 
$125 million
 initially held in escrow) and the fair value of our global energy
business of $
2,046 million
, which we determined using discounted cash flow analyses, resulting in total consideration transferred of $
4,196 million
.
As such, we have allocated the total consideration transferred to the individual assets and business acquired based on a relative fair value basis, using the closing date fair values of each element,
as follows (in millions):
 
June 12, 2015
Equity investment in Monster
$
3,066
Expansion of distribution territories
1,035
Monster non-energy drink business
95
Total assets and business acquired
$
4,196
In addition to our ownership interest in Monster's outstanding common stock, the Company is represented by two directors on Monster's 10 member Board of Directors. Based on our equity
ownership percentage, the significance that our expanded distribution and coordination agreements have on Monster's operations, and our representation on Monster's Board of Directors, the
Company is accounting for its interest in Monster as an equity method investment.
88
As a result of the Monster Transaction, the North America Coca-Cola system obtained the right to distribute Monster products in territories for which it was not previously the authorized
distributor ("expanded territories"). These distribution rights are governed by an agreement with an initial term of 
20 years
, after which it will continue to remain in effect unless otherwise
terminated by either party, and there are no future costs of renewal. As such, these rights were determined to be indefinite-lived intangible assets and are classified in the line item bottlers'
franchise rights with indefinite lives in our consolidated balance sheet. CCR is the distributor in the majority of the expanded territories. The remainder of the territories are serviced by
independent bottling partners. Of the 
$1,035 million
 allocated to the expanded distribution rights, the Company derecognized 
$341 million
 related to the expanded territories serviced by the
independent bottling partners upon the close of the transaction. As consideration for these rights, the Company received an upfront payment of 
$28 million
 related to these territories, and we
will receive a payment per case on all future sales made by these independent bottlers for the duration of the distribution agreements. As these payments are dependent on future sales, they are a
form of contingent consideration. We elected to account for this consideration in the same manner as the contingent consideration to be received in the North America refranchising, discussed
below. This resulted in a net loss of 
$313 million
 recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income during the 
year ended
 December 31, 2015.
During the 
year ended
 December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a gain of 
$1,715 million
 on the sale of our global energy drink business, primarily due to the difference in the recorded
carrying value of the assets transferred, including an allocated portion of goodwill, compared to the value of the total assets and business acquired. After considering the loss resulting from the
derecognition of the expanded territory rights serviced by the independent bottling partners, the net gain recognized on the Monster Transaction was 
$1,403 million
, which was recorded in the
line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. Additionally, under the terms of the Monster Transaction, we were required to discontinue selling energy products
under certain trademarks, including one trademark in the glacéau portfolio. The Company recognized an impairment charge of 
$380 million
 upon closing, primarily related to the
discontinuation of the energy products in the glacéau portfolio, which was recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income.
During the 
year ended
 December 31, 2015, based on the relative fair values of the total assets and business acquired, 
$1,620 million
 of the 
$2,150 million
 cash payment made was classified in
the line item acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. The remaining 
$530 million
 was classified in the
line item other investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
German Bottling Operations
In conjunction with the Company's acquisition of German bottling operations in 2007, the former owners received put options to sell their respective shares in the operations back to the
Company in January 2014. The Company paid $
503 million
 to purchase these shares, which was included in the line item other financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows,
resulting in 
100 percent
 ownership of our German bottling operations. This bottler was deconsolidated in conjunction with the Coca-Cola European Partners transaction discussed further below.
Divestitures
During 
2016
, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled 
$1,035 million
, primarily related to proceeds from the refranchising of
certain of our bottling territories in North America.
During 
2015
, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $
565 million
, which included proceeds from the refranchising of certain of
our bottling territories in North America and proceeds from the sale of a 
10 percent
 interest in a Brazilian bottling partner as a result of the majority owners exercising their right to acquire
additional shares from us.
During 
2014
, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled 
$148 million
, which primarily represented the proceeds from the
refranchising of certain of our bottling territories in North America.
89
North America Refranchising
In conjunction with implementing a new beverage partnership model in North America, the Company refranchised bottling territories that were previously managed by CCR to certain of our
unconsolidated bottling partners. These territories generally border these bottlers' existing territories, allowing each bottler to better service local customers and provide more efficient
execution. By entering into comprehensive beverage agreements ("CBAs") with each of the bottlers, we granted certain exclusive territory rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and
sale of Company-owned and licensed beverage products as defined by the CBA. 
In some cases, the Company has entered into, or agreed to enter into, manufacturing agreements that authorize
certain bottlers that have executed a CBA to manufacture certain beverage products. If a bottler has not entered into a specific manufacturing agreement, then under the CBA for these
territories, CCR retains the rights to produce these beverage products and the bottlers will purchase from CCR (or other Company-authorized manufacturing bottlers) substantially all of the
related finished products needed in order to service the customers in these territories.
Each CBA generally has a term of 
10 years
 and is renewable, in most cases by the bottler and in some cases by the Company, indefinitely for successive additional terms of 
10 years
 each.
Under the CBA, the bottlers will make ongoing quarterly payments to the Company based on their gross profit in the refranchised territories throughout the term of the CBA, including renewals,
in exchange for the grant of the exclusive territory rights.
Contemporaneously with the grant of these rights, the Company sold the distribution assets, certain working capital items, and the exclusive rights to distribute certain beverage brands not
owned by the Company, but distributed by CCR, in each of these territories to the respective bottlers in exchange for cash. These rights include, where applicable, the distribution rights
acquired from Monster in 2015 for the respective territories.
In 2016, the Company formed a new National Product Supply System ("NPSS") to facilitate optimal operation of the U.S. product supply system. Under the NPSS, the Company and several of
its existing independent producing bottlers administer key national product supply activities for these bottlers. Additionally, we have sold or are in the process of selling certain production
facilities from CCR to these independent producing bottlers in exchange for cash.
During the years ended 
December 31, 2016
, 
December 31, 2015
 and 
December 31, 2014
, cash proceeds from these sales totaled 
$1,017 million
, 
$362 million
 and 
$143 million
, respectively.
Included in the cash proceeds for the years ended 
December 31, 2016
, 
December 31, 2015
 and 
December 31, 2014
 was 
$279 million
, 
$83 million
 and 
$42 million
, respectively, from Coca-Cola
Bottling Co. Consolidated ("CCBCC"), an equity method investee.
Under the applicable accounting guidance, we were required to derecognize all of the tangible assets sold as well as the intangible assets transferred, including distribution rights, customer
relationships and an allocated portion of goodwill related to these territories. We recognized losses of 
$2,456 million
, 
$1,006 million
 and 
$799 million
 during the years ended 
December 31,
2016
, 
December 31, 2015
 and 
December 31, 2014
, respectively. These losses primarily related to the derecognition of the intangible assets transferred or reclassified as held for sale and were
included in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income. See further discussion of assets and liabilities held for sale below. We expect to recover the value
of the intangible assets transferred to the bottlers under the CBAs through the future quarterly payments; however, as the payments for the territory rights are dependent on the bottlers' future
gross profit in these territories, they are considered a form of contingent consideration.
There is diversity in practice as it relates to the accounting for contingent consideration by the seller. The seller can account for the future contingent payments received as a gain contingency,
recognizing the amounts in the income statement only after the related contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized, which in this arrangement will be quarterly as the bottlers earn gross
profit in the transferred territories. Alternatively, the seller can record a receivable for the contingent consideration at fair value on the date of sale and record any future differences between the
payments received and this receivable in the income statement as they occur. We elected the gain contingency treatment since the quarterly payments will be received throughout the terms of
the CBAs, including all subsequent renewals, regardless of the cumulative amount received as compared to the value of the intangible assets transferred.
During the 
year ended
 
December 31, 2016
, the Company incurred 
$31 million
 of expense related to payments made to certain of our unconsolidated bottling partners in order to convert the
bottling agreements for their legacy territories and any previously refranchised territories to a single form of CBA with additional requirements. The additional requirements generally include a
binding national governance model, mandatory incidence pricing and additional core performance requirements, among other things. As a result of these conversions, the legacy territories and
any previously refranchised territories for each of the related bottling partners will be governed under similar CBAs, which will provide consistency across each such bottler's respective
territory, and consistency with other U.S. bottlers that have been granted or converted to this form of CBA. The expense related to these payments was included in the line item other income
(loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income during the 
year ended
 
December 31, 2016
.
90
Coca-Cola European Partners
In August 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to combine our German bottling operations with Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. ("CCE") and Coca-Cola Iberian Partners, S.A.U.,
formerly known as Coca-Cola Iberian Partners, S.A. ("CCIP"), to create CCEP. As of December 31, 2015, our German bottling operations were classified as held for sale. On May 28, 2016,
the transaction closed and we exchanged our German bottling operations for an 
18 percent
 interest in CCEP. As a result of recording our interest in CCEP at fair value based on its quoted
market price, the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations, and the related reversal of its cumulative translation adjustments, we recognized a gain of 
$1,400 million
. This gain was
partially offset by a 
$77 million
 loss incurred as a result of reclassifying losses related to our net investment hedges of our German bottling operations from AOCI into earnings as well as
transaction costs incurred resulting in a net gain of 
$1,287 million
 during the 
year ended
 
December 31, 2016
. Refer to Note 15. With the exception of the transaction costs, the net gain was
recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. The Company accounts for its 
18 percent
 interest in CCEP as an equity method investment based
on our equity ownership percentage, our representation on CCEP's Board of Directors, material intercompany transactions and other governance rights.
Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.
In February 2014, the Company purchased newly issued shares in Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. ("Keurig") for 
$1,265 million
, including transaction costs of 
$14 million
. In May 2014, the
Company purchased additional shares of Keurig in the market for 
$302 million
, which represented an additional 
2 percent
 equity position in Keurig.
Subsequent to these purchases, the Company entered into an agreement with Credit Suisse Capital LLC ("CS") to purchase additional shares of Keurig which would increase the Company's
equity position to a 
16 percent
 interest based on the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Keurig as of May 1, 2014. Under the agreement, the Company was to purchase from CS, on
a date selected by CS no later than February 2015, the lesser of (1) 
6.5 million
 shares of Keurig or (2) the number of shares that shall cause our ownership to equal 
16 percent
. The purchase
price per share was the average of the daily volume-weighted average price per share from May 15, 2014, to the date selected by CS, as adjusted in certain circumstances specified in the
agreement. CS had exclusive ownership and control over any such shares until delivered to the Company. In February 2015, the Company purchased 
6.4 million
 shares from CS under this
agreement for a total purchase price of 
$830 million
. As this agreement qualified as a derivative, we recognized a loss of 
$58 million
 in the line item other income (loss) — net in our
consolidated statement of income during the 
year ended
 December 31, 2015. The Company recognized a cumulative loss of 
$47 million
 in the line item other income (loss) — net in our
consolidated statement of income over the term of the agreement. The purchases of the shares were included in the line item purchases of investments in our consolidated statement of cash
flows, net of any related derivative impact. The Company accounted for the investment in Keurig as an available-for-sale security, which was included in the line item other investments in our
consolidated balance sheet.
In March 2016, a JAB Holding Company-led investor group acquired Keurig for 
$92
 per share. The Company received proceeds of 
$2,380 million
, which were recorded in the line item
proceeds from disposals of investments in our consolidated statement of cash flows, and recorded a gain of 
$18 million
 related to the disposal of our shares of Keurig in the line item other
income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income during the 
year ended
 
December 31, 2016
.
Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited
In November 2014, the Company, SABMiller plc and Gutsche Family Investments entered into an agreement to combine bottling operations of each of the parties' nonalcoholic ready-to-drink
beverage businesses in Southern and East Africa. In connection with the July 2, 2016 closing of the transaction to form the new bottler, which is called Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary
Limited ("CCBA"), the Company: (1) contributed its South African bottling operations to CCBA, which included certain wholly owned subsidiaries and an equity method investment, (2) paid
$150 million
 in cash, (3) obtained a 
12 percent
 interest in CCBA and a 
3 percent
 interest in CCBA's South African subsidiary and (4) acquired several trademarks that are generally indefinite-
lived.
As a result of recording our interests in CCBA and its South African subsidiary at fair value, the deconsolidation of our South African bottling operations, the derecognition of the equity
method investment, and the reversal of related cumulative translation adjustments, we recognized a loss of 
$21 million
. The fair values of the equity investments in CCBA and CCBA's South
African subsidiary along with the acquired trademarks were determined using income approaches, including discounted cash flow models, and the Company believes the inputs and
assumptions used are consistent with those hypothetical marketplace participants would use. The loss recognized resulted primarily from the reversal of the related cumulative translation
adjustments. This loss is recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income during the 
year ended
 
December 31, 2016
.
91
Through the Company's 
12 percent
 interest in CCBA, the Company is represented by two directors on CCBA's 10-member Board of Directors. Based on the level of equity ownership, the
Company’s representation on the Board of Directors, material intercompany transactions and other governance rights, the Company is accounting for its interests in CCBA and CCBA's South
African subsidiary as equity method investments.
In October 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev ("ABI") acquired SABMiller plc, including its controlling interest in CCBA. In December 2016, the Company and ABI reached an agreement
regarding the transition of ABI's stake in CCBA for an equity value of 
$3,150 million
, after customary adjustments. The Company has also agreed in principle to acquire ABI's interest in
bottling operations in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, El Salvador and Honduras. The Company will negotiate the terms of this transaction with ABI according to the
contractual parameters. The transactions are subject to the relevant regulatory and minority shareholder approvals and are expected to close by the end of 2017. We plan to hold all of these
territories temporarily until they can be refranchised to other partners.
Brazilian Bottling Operations
In December 2014, the Company received notification that the owners of the majority interest in a Brazilian bottling operation had exercised their option to acquire from us shares representing
a 
10 percent
 interest in the entity's outstanding shares. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an estimated loss of 
$32 million
 as a result of the exercise price being lower than
our carrying value of these shares. The transaction closed in January 2015, and the Company recorded an additional loss of 
$6 million
 during the year ended December 31, 2015, calculated
based on the final option price. As a result of this transaction, the Company's ownership was reduced to 
34 percent
 of the entity’s outstanding shares. The owners of the majority interest have a
remaining option to acquire an additional 
14 percent
 interest of the entity's outstanding shares at any time through December 31, 2019, based on an agreed-upon formula.
Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale
North America Refranchising
As of 
December 31, 2016
, the Company had entered into agreements, or otherwise approved plans, to refranchise additional territories in North America. For territories that met the criteria to
be classified as held for sale, we were required to record their assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell based on the agreed-upon sale price. The
Company expects that these territories will be refranchised within the next 12 months.
Refranchising of China Bottling Operations
In November 2016, the Company entered into definitive agreements for the sale of the Company-owned bottling operations in China to the two existing franchise bottlers and to sell a related
cost method investment to one of the franchise bottlers. Closing is subject to various regulatory approvals and is expected in the first half of 2017. As a result, the Company's bottling operations
in China and a related cost method investment met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, which requires us to present the related assets and liabilities as separate line items in our
consolidated balance sheet. We were not required to record these assets and liabilities at fair value less any costs to sell because their fair value approximates our carrying value.

NOTE 3
: 
INVESTMENTS
Investments in debt and marketable securities, other than investments accounted for under the equity method, are classified as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Our marketable
equity investments are classified as either trading or available-for-sale with their cost basis determined by the specific identification method. Our investments in debt securities are carried at
either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-
maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and
losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on available-for-sale
securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of AOCI, except for the change in fair value attributable to the currency risk being hedged. Refer to 
Note 5
 for
additional information related to the Company's fair value hedges of available-for-sale securities.

In 
2016
 and 
2015
, the Company had investments classified as available-for-sale securities in which our cost basis exceeded the fair value of our investment. Management assessed each of these
investments on an individual basis to determine if the decline in fair value was other than temporary. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among
other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability
to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. As a result of these assessments, management determined that the decline in fair
value of these investments was not other than temporary and did not record any impairment charges.
The Company uses insurance captives to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the pension obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. In accordance
with local insurance regulations, our insurance captive is required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest its solvency capital in a
portfolio of available-for-sale securities, which have been classified in the line item other assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets are not available to satisfy our current
obligations. As of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, the Company's available-for-sale securities included solvency capital funds of $
985 million
 and $
804 million
, respectively.

The Company expects that actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities above because borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.
Cost Method Investments
Cost method investments are initially recorded at cost, and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. Cost method investments are reported as other investments in
our consolidated balance sheets, and dividend income from cost method investments is reported in other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income. We review all of our
cost method investments quarterly to determine if impairment indicators are present; however, we are not required to determine the fair value of these investments unless impairment indicators
exist. When impairment indicators exist, we generally use discounted cash flow analyses to determine the fair value. We estimate that the fair values of our cost method investments
approximated or exceeded their carrying values as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
. Our cost method investments had a carrying value of $
140 million
 and $
190 million
 as of 
December 31,

, respectively.

NOTE 5
: 
HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and
are referred to as "market risks." When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary
market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate
risk.
The Company uses various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts
and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date, and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is
an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the
future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect
expected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap
agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign-denominated debt, in hedging relationships.
All derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other assets; other assets; accounts payable and
accrued expenses; and other liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same
counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the
same counterparty.
The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging
instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the
fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the
fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net
investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period
the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative
instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated
and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized into earnings.
For derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying
exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at the inception and at least quarterly
thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. Any
ineffective portion of a financial instrument's change in fair value is immediately recognized into earnings.
The Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to 
Note 16
. The notional amounts of the derivative
financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts
exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates or other financial
indices. The Company does not view the fair values of its derivatives in isolation but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures.
Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.

Credit Risk Associated with Derivatives
We have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty exposures regularly
and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring collateral for substantially all of our
transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial instrument increases. In addition, the Company's master
netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same counterparty. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative
transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Based on these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.
Cash Flow Hedging Strategy
The Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated
statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are
immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is typically 
three years
.
The Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our eventual U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and U.S. dollar net
cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and purchase foreign currency options
(principally euros and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign
currencies, the decline in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in the fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar
weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives
that have been designated and qualify for the Company's foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $
6,074 million
 and $
10,383 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively.
The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of its foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For this
hedging program, the Company records the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair
value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. During the year ended 
December 31, 2015
, the Company discontinued the cash flow hedge relationships related to these swaps. Upon discontinuance, the Company recognized
a loss of 
$92 million
 in other comprehensive income, which will be reclassified from AOCI into interest expense over the remaining life of the debt, a weighted-average period of approximately
10 years
. The Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedging relationships during the year ended 
2016
. The total notional values of derivatives that have been designated as cash flow
hedges for the Company's foreign currency denominated debt were 
$1,851 million
 and 
$566 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively.
The Company has entered into commodity futures contracts and other derivative instruments on various commodities to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials
used in our manufacturing process. These derivative instruments have been designated and qualify as part of the Company's commodity cash flow hedging program. The objective of this
hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of certain commodities. The total notional values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify
for this program were $

Our Company monitors our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly. From time to time, we manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial
instruments. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements and has designated these instruments as part of the Company's interest rate cash flow hedging program. The objective
of this hedging program is to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on the Company's future interest payments. The total notional values of these interest rate swap
agreements that were designated and qualified for the Company's interest rate cash flow hedging program were $
1,500 million
 and $
3,328 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015

The Company records gains and losses reclassified from AOCI into income for the effective portion and ineffective portion, if any, to the same line items in our consolidated statements of
income.

Includes a de minimis amount of ineffectiveness in the hedging
relationship.
As of 
December 31, 2016
, the Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months net gains of $
532 million
 from the pretax amount recorded in AOCI as the
anticipated cash flows occur.
Fair Value Hedging Strategy
The Company uses interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that results from fluctuations in benchmark
interest rates. The Company also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated debt relating to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and benchmark interest rates. The changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged items are recognized
in earnings. The ineffective portions of these hedges are immediately recognized into earnings. As of 
December 31, 2016
, such adjustments had cumulatively decreased the carrying value of
our long-term debt by $
67 million
. When a derivative is no longer designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, including termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference
between the carrying value of the hedged item at that time and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or immediately if the
hedged item has matured. The total notional values of derivatives that related to our fair value hedges of this type were $
6,158 million
 and $
7,963 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
,
respectively.
99
The Company also uses fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of certain available-for-sale securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The
changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are
recognized in earnings. As a result, any difference is reflected in earnings as ineffectiveness. The total notional values of derivatives that related to our fair value hedges of this type were $
1,163
million
 and $
2,159 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively.

Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations Strategy
The Company uses forward contracts and non-derivative financial instruments to protect the value of our net investments in a number of foreign operations. During the years ended
December 31, 2016
 and 2015, the Company designated a portion of its euro-denominated debt as a hedge of a net investment in our European operations. The change in the carrying value of
the designated portion of the euro-denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in net foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of AOCI. For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in net foreign
currency translation adjustment, to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from AOCI into
earnings during the period of change.

The Company reclassified net deferred losses of 
$77 million
 related to the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations from AOCI into earnings during the year ended 
December 31,
2016
. The Company did not reclassify any deferred gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI to earnings during the 
years ended
 
December 31, 2015
 and 
2014
. In addition, the
Company did not have any ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the 
years ended
 
December 31, 2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
. The cash inflows and outflows associated with the
Company's derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified in the line item other investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Economic (Non-Designated) Hedging Strategy
In addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges of foreign currency, interest rate and
commodity exposure. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair value of economic
hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
The Company uses foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on certain monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in nonfunctional currencies. The changes in fair value of economic hedges used to offset those monetary assets and liabilities are immediately recognized into earnings in the line
item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we use foreign currency economic hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows associated with
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair values of economic hedges used to offset the variability in U.S. dollar net cash flows are recognized into earnings in the line
items net operating revenues or cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic
hedges were $
5,276 million
 and $
3,605 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively.
The Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process and for vehicle fuel. The
changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold, and selling, general and administrative
expenses in our consolidated statements of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our economic hedges of this type were $
447 million
 and $
893 million
 as of
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively.

: 
EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method investees. When we record our proportionate share of net income, it
increases equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income and our carrying value in that investment. Conversely, when we record our proportionate share of a net loss, it
decreases equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income and our carrying value in that investment. The Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of our
equity method investees includes significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by our equity method investees. These items can have a significant impact on the amount of equity
income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income and our carrying value in those investments. Refer to 
Note 17
 for additional information related to significant operating and
nonoperating items recorded by our equity method investees. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also impacted by our proportionate share of items impacting the equity
investee's AOCI.
We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.
The Company's equity method investments include our ownership interests in Coca-Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Hellenic, 
Coca-Cola Amatil Limited, CCEP and Monster. As of 
December 31,
2016
, we owned approximately 
28 percent
, 
23 percent
, 
29 percent
, 
18 percent
 and 
18 percent
, respectively, of these companies' outstanding shares. As of 
December 31, 2016
, our investment in
our equity method investees in the aggregate exceeded our proportionate share of the net assets of these equity method investees by $
6,792 million
. This difference is not amortized.

 in 
2016
, 
2015
 and

If valued at the 
December 31, 2016
 quoted closing prices of shares actively traded on stock markets, the value of our equity method investments in publicly traded bottlers would have
exceeded our carrying value by $
6,179 million
. However, the carrying value of our investment in CCEP exceeded the fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2016 by 
$462 million
.
Based on the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to
retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature.
Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge.
Net Receivables and Dividends from Equity Method Investees
Total net receivables due from equity method investees were $
1,696 million
 and $

DEBT AND BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS
Short-Term Borrowings
Loans and notes payable consist primarily of commercial paper issued in the United States. As of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, we had $
12,330 million
 and $
13,035 million
, respectively, in
outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Our weighted-average interest rates for commercial paper outstanding were approximately 
0.8 percent
 and 
0.5 percent

 and 
2015
, respectively. In addition, we had $
9,598 million
 in lines of credit and other short-term credit facilities as of 
December 31, 2016
. The Company's total lines of credit included
$
168 million
 that was outstanding and primarily related to our international operations.
Included in the credit facilities discussed above, the Company had $
8,170 million
 in lines of credit for general corporate purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from
2017
 through 
2022
. There were no borrowings under these backup lines of credit during 
2016
. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial
arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company.

The above notes and debentures include various restrictions, none of which is presently significant to our
Company.
The carrying value of the Company's long-term debt included fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from 
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s ("Old CCE") former North America business
in 2010 of $
361 million
 and $
411 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively. These fair value adjustments are being amortized over the number of years remaining until the
underlying debt matures. As of 
December 31, 2016
, the weighted-average maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate was approximately 
21
 years. The
amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in future periods, which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to
service the debt.
Total interest paid was $
663 million

NOTE 11
: 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Guarantees
As of 
December 31, 2016
, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $
587 million
, of which $
247 million
 was related to VIEs. Refer to 
Note 1
 for
additional information related to the Company's maximum exposure to loss due to our involvement with VIEs. Our guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers, vendors
and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant.
The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to
satisfy these guarantees.
We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.
Legal Contingencies
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings. We establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and/or for which no
estimate of possible losses can be made. Management believes that the total liabilities to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.
Indemnifications
At the time we acquire or divest our interest in an entity, we sometimes agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Management believes that any liability to the
Company that may arise as a result of any such indemnification agreements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.
Tax Audits
The Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. These audits may result in the assessment of additional taxes that are subsequently
resolved with authorities or potentially through the courts. Refer to 
Note 14
.
On September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency ("Notice") from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for the tax years 2007 through 2009, after a five-year
audit. In the Notice, the IRS claims that the Company's United States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional federal income tax liability of
approximately 
$3.3 billion
 for the period, plus interest. No penalties were asserted in the Notice. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer pricing matter involving the appropriate
amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to certain related foreign licensees regarding the manufacturing,
distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas markets.
108
The Company has followed the same transfer pricing methodology for these licenses since the methodology was agreed with the IRS in a 1996 closing agreement that applied back to 1987. The
closing agreement provides prospective penalty protection as long as the Company follows the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant Federal tax law have
not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company, without further explanation, that the IRS has determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant Federal tax law
have changed and that it may assert penalties. The Company does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and confirmed by the
IRS in five successive audit cycles covering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit concluding as recently as 2009.
The Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Therefore, the
Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and Mutual Agreement Program.
The Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To that end, the
Company filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court on December 14, 2015, and the IRS filed its answer on February 12, 2016. A trial date has been set for March 5, 2018. The Company intends to
vigorously defend its position and is confident in its ability to prevail on the merits. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as
this to determine the adequacy of its tax reserves. The Company believes that the final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, the additional tax, interest and any potential
penalties could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Risk Management Programs
The Company has numerous global insurance programs in place to help protect the Company from the risk of loss. In general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of
claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company's risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company's self-insured losses are
estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. The Company's self-
insurance reserves totaled $
527 million
 and $
560 million
 as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, respectively.
Workforce (Unaudited)
We refer to our employees as "associates." As of 
December 31, 2016
, our Company had approximately 
100,300
 associates, of which approximately 
51,000
 associates were located in the United
States. Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. As of 
December 31, 2016
, approximately 
16,300
 associates, excluding
seasonal hires, in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically have terms of 
three years
 to 
five years
. We currently expect that we will be able
to renegotiate such agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. The Company believes that its relations with its associates are generally satisfactory.

NOTE 12
: 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
Our Company grants awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. Total stock-based compensation expense was $
258 million
, $
236 million
 and
$
209 million
 in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively, and was included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. The total income
tax benefit recognized in our consolidated statements of income related to awards under these plans was $
71 million
, $
65 million
 and $
57 million
 in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively.
Beginning in 2015, certain employees who had previously been eligible for long-term equity awards received long-term performance cash awards. Employees who receive these performance
cash awards do not receive equity awards as part of the long-term incentive program.
As of 
December 31, 2016
, we had $
267 million
 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans. This cost is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.5 years
 as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards.
The Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan ("2014 Equity Plan") was approved by shareowners in April 2014. Under the 2014 Equity Plan, a maximum of 
500 million
 shares of our common
stock was approved to be issued, through the grant of equity awards, to certain employees. The 2014 Equity Plan allows for grants of stock options, performance share units, restricted stock
units, restricted stock and other specified award types including cash awards with performance-based vesting criteria. Beginning in 2015, the 2014 Equity Plan was the primary plan in use for
equity awards and performance cash awards. There were no grants made from the 2014 Equity Plan prior to 2015. As of 
December 31, 2016
, there were 
448.3 million
 shares available to be
granted under the 2014 Equity Plan. In addition to the 2014 Equity Plan, there were 
2.7 million
 shares available to be granted under stock option plans approved by shareowners in 1999 and
2008 and 
0.2 million
 shares available to be granted under a restricted stock award plan approved by shareowners in 1989.
Stock Option Awards
Stock options have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low market prices per share for the Company's stock on the date of grant. The fair value of
each stock option award is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model and is amortized over the vesting period, generally 
four years
. The weighted-average fair value of
stock options granted during the past three years and the weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model for such grants were as follows:

The dividend yield is the calculated yield on the Company's stock at the time of the
grant.

Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company's stock, historical volatility of the Company's stock and other
factors.
3
 
The risk-free interest rate for the period matching the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the
grant.
4
 
The expected term of the stock options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing historical exercise
behavior.
Generally, stock options granted from 1999 through July 2003 expire 
15 years
 from the date of grant, and stock options granted in December 2003 and thereafter expire 
10 years
 from the date
of grant. The shares of common stock to be issued and/or sold upon exercise of stock options are made available from either authorized and unissued Company common stock or from the
Company's treasury shares. In 2007, the Company began issuing common stock under its stock-based compensation plans from the Company's treasury shares.

Performance share units require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are predefined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. The primary
performance criterion used is compound annual growth in economic profit over a predefined performance period, which is generally 
three years
. Economic profit is our net operating profit after
tax less the cost of the capital used in our business. Beginning in 2015, the Company added net operating revenues as an additional performance criterion. Economic profit and net operating
revenues are adjusted for certain items, which are approved and certified by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-
year comparison of the specific performance criteria. In the event the certified results equal the predefined performance criteria, the Company will grant the number of shares equal to the target
award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance criteria, additional shares up to the maximum award will be granted. In the event the certified results fall below the
predefined performance criteria, a reduced number of shares will be granted. If the certified results fall below the threshold award performance level, no shares will be granted. The
performance share units granted under this program are then generally subject to a holding period of one year before the shares are released.
Performance share units generally do not entitle participants to vote or receive dividends. For most performance share units granted beginning in 2014, the Company includes a relative TSR
modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. For these awards, the number of shares earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined
performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies
falls outside of a defined range. The fair value of performance share units that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For the remaining awards that do
not include the TSR modifier, the fair value of the performance share units is the quoted market value of the Company's stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends
not received during the relevant period.
In the period it becomes probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the award will be achieved, we recognize expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the
performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the shares expected to vest and be released. The remaining fair value of the shares expected to vest and be
released is expensed on a straight-line basis over the balance of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance
criteria specified in the award, we reverse all of the previously recognized compensation expense in the period such a determination is made.
Performance share units are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such as death or disability, in which case former employees or their beneficiaries are provided a cash
equivalent payment. As of 
December 31, 2016
, performance share units of 
4,830,000
, 
1,640,000
 and 
3,303,000
 were outstanding for the 2014–2016, 2015–2017 and 2016–2018 performance
periods, respectively, based on the target award amounts in the performance share unit agreements.

Time-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Prior to the release date, time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units granted from the 2014 Equity Plan do not entitle participants to vote or receive dividends and will be forfeited in
the event of the recipient's termination of employment, except for reasons such as death or disability. Certain other time-based restricted stock awards entitle participants to vote and receive
dividends, while for certain other time-based restricted stock units, participants may receive payment of dividend equivalents but are not allowed to vote. The fair value of the restricted stock
and restricted stock units expected to vest and be released is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. As of 
December 31, 2016
, the Company had outstanding nonvested time-
based restricted stock, including restricted stock units, of 
770,244
, most of which do not pay dividends or have voting rights.
 
NOTE 13
: 
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
Our Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified,
unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside
the United States.
We refer to the funded defined benefit pension plan in the United States that is not associated with collective bargaining organizations as the "primary U.S. plan." As of 
December 31, 2016
, the
primary U.S. plan represented 
58 percent
 and 
61 percent
 of the Company's consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension assets, respectively.

Investment Strategy for U.S. Pension Plans
The Company utilizes the services of investment managers to actively manage the assets of our U.S. pension plans. We have established asset allocation targets and investment guidelines with
each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the plans.
Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns
among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 
42 percent
 equity investments, 
30 percent
 fixed-income investments and 
28 percent
 alternative investments. We believe this target
allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:
(1)
optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of
risk;
(2)
maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers;
and
(3)
maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset
class.
The guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible
and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Unless exceptions have been approved, investment managers are prohibited from buying or
selling commodities, futures or option contracts, as well as from short selling of securities. Additionally, investment managers agree to obtain written approval for deviations from stated
investment style or guidelines. As of 
December 31, 2016
, no investment manager was responsible for more than 
7 percent
 of total U.S. plan assets.
Our target allocation of 
42 percent
 equity investments is composed of 
60 percent
 global equities, 
16 percent
 emerging market equities and 
24 percent
 domestic small- and mid-cap equities.
Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. Investments in the common stock of our
Company accounted for approximately 
5 percent
 of our total global equities and approximately 
2 percent
 of total U.S. plan assets. Our investments in global equities are intended to provide
diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small- and mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their
market value on a periodic basis. Our investments in these asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.
Our target allocation of 
30 percent
 fixed-income investments is composed of 
33 percent
 long-duration bonds and 
67 percent
 with multi-strategy alternative credit managers. Long-duration bonds
are intended to provide a stable rate of return through investments in high-quality publicly traded debt securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are diversified in order to mitigate
duration and credit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured credit and emerging market debt. These investments
are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce higher returns compared to long-duration bonds and also help to diversify our overall fixed-income portfolio.
In addition to equity investments and fixed-income investments, we have a target allocation of 
28 percent
 in alternative investments. These alternative investments include hedge funds,
reinsurance, private equity limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds, international venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of investing in alternative investments is to
provide a higher rate of return than that available from publicly traded equity securities. These investments are inherently illiquid and require a long-term perspective in evaluating investment
performance.
Investment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans
As of 
December 31, 2016
, the long-term target allocation for 
73 percent
 of our international subsidiaries' pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European and Canadian plans, is 
60
percent
 equity securities; 
25 percent
 fixed-income securities; and 
15 percent
 other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining 
27 percent
 of the Company's international subsidiaries'
plan assets consisted of 
55 percent
 mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 
1 percent
 equity securities; 
3 percent
 fixed-income securities; and 
41 percent
 other investments. The investment
strategies for our international subsidiaries' plans differ greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local law. None of our pension plans outside the United States is individually
significant for separate disclosure.
115
Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
Plan assets associated with other postretirement benefits primarily represent funding of one of the U.S. postretirement benefit plans through a U.S. Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association
("VEBA"), a tax-qualified trust. The VEBA assets are primarily invested in liquid assets due to the level and timing of expected future benefit payments.

Actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a corridor approach. The gain/loss corridor is equal to 
10 percent
 of the greater of the benefit obligation and the market-related value of assets. Gains and
losses in excess of the corridor are generally amortized over the average future working lifetime of the plan participants.

The expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of
historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The expected long-term rate of
return assumption used in computing 
2016
 net periodic pension cost for the U.S. plans was 
8.25 percent
. As of 
December 31, 2016
, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return on plan
assets for the primary U.S. plan was 
8.7 percent
, 
4.9 percent
 and 
6.9 percent
, respectively. The annualized return since inception was 
10.6 percent
.
The assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows:

The Company's U.S. postretirement benefit plans are primarily defined dollar benefit plans that limit the effects of medical inflation because the plans have established dollar limits for
determining our contributions. As a result, the effect of a 
1
 percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would not be significant to the Company.
The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. Rates for U.S. and
certain non-U.S. plans at 
December 31, 2016
, were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were
applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate on comparable indices within each of the countries. The rate of
compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews. We review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the
health care cost trend rate assumptions.
Effective January 1, 2016, for benefit plans using the yield curve approach, the Company changed the method used to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic
benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and is measuring these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. The
Company believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and the corresponding spot
rates. The change did not affect the measurement of the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for those plans and was accounted for as a change in accounting
estimate, which is applied prospectively.

The expected benefit payments for our other postretirement benefit plans are net of estimated federal subsidies expected to be received under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003. Federal subsidies are estimated to be 
$4 million
 for the period 2017–2021, and 
$3 million
 for the period 2022–2026.
The Company anticipates making pension contributions in 2017 of 
$106 million
, the majority of which will be allocated to our international plans. The majority of these contributions are
discretionary.
Defined Contribution Plans
Our Company sponsors qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the largest U.S. defined contribution plan, we match participants' contributions up
to a maximum of 
3.5 percent
 of compensation, subject to certain limitations. Company costs related to the U.S. plans were 
$82 million
, 
$94 million
 and 
$92 million
 in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
,
respectively. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain locations outside the United States. Company costs associated with those plans were 
$37 million
, 
$35 million
 and 
$36
million
 in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively.

Multi-Employer Pension Plans
As a result of our acquisition of Old CCE's North America business in 2010, the Company now participates in various multi-employer pension plans in the United States. Multi-employer
pension plans are designed to cover employees from multiple employers and are typically established under collective bargaining agreements. These plans allow multiple employers to pool
their pension resources and realize efficiencies associated with the daily administration of the plan.
Multi-employer plans are generally governed by a board of trustees composed of management and labor representatives and are funded through employer contributions.
The Company's expense for U.S. multi-employer pension plans totaled 
$41 million
, $
40 million
 and 
$38 million
 in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. The plans we currently participate in have
contractual arrangements that extend into 2021. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from any of the multi-employer pension plans in which we currently participate, we would need to
record the appropriate withdrawal liabilities at that time.

Our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 
35.0 percent
. As
a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and
Swaziland. The terms of these grants expire from 
2017
 to 
2036
. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our
income tax expense by $
105 million
, $
223 million
 and $
265 million
 for the years ended 
December 31, 2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits
of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate.
The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. U.S. tax authorities have completed their federal
income tax examinations for all years prior to 
2007
. With respect to state and local jurisdictions and countries outside the United States, with limited exceptions, the Company and its
subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 
2006
. For U.S. federal and state tax purposes, the net operating losses and tax credit carryovers acquired in connection
with our acquisition of Old CCE's North America business that were generated between the years of 
1990
 through 
2010
 are subject to adjustments until the year in which they are actually
utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have
been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result from those years.
On September 17, 2015, the Company received a Notice from the IRS for the tax years 
2007
 through 
2009
, after a five-year audit. Refer to Note 11.
As of 
December 31, 2016
, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $
302 million
. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of
$
179 million
, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $
123 million
, which was recorded as a deferred tax asset, primarily represents tax benefits that would be
received in different tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.
A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

The increase is primarily related to a change in judgment about one of the Company’s tax positions as a result of receiving notification of a preliminary settlement of a Competent Authority matter with a
foreign jurisdiction, a portion of which became certain later in the year. This change in position did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statement of income during the year ended
December 31, 2016, as it was partially offset by refunds to be received from the foreign jurisdiction.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had $
142 million
, $
111 million
 and $
113 million
 in interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of 
December 31, 2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. Of these amounts, 
$31 million
 and $
8 million
 of expense were recognized
through income tax expense in 2016 and 
2014
, respectively. An insignificant amount of interest and penalties were recognized through income tax expense for the year ended December 31,
2015. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.
It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our consolidated statements
of income or consolidated balance sheets. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, statute of limitations expiring or final settlements in transfer pricing matters that are
the subject of litigation. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.
121
As of 
December 31, 2016
, indefinitely reinvested earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries amounted to $
35.5 billion
. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and,
accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to
both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation; however, unrecognized foreign tax credits would be available to reduce a
portion of the U.S. tax liability.

The Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards from
operations in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize
these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these
jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable
income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
In 
2016
, the Company recognized a net increase of $
53 million
 in its valuation allowances. This increase was primarily due to the increase in non-deductible expenses incurred during the
normal course of business operations.
In 
2015
, the Company recognized a net decrease of $
172 million
 in its valuation allowances. As a result of our German bottling operations meeting the criteria to be classified as held for sale,
the Company was required to present the related assets and liabilities as separate line items in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the changes in net operating losses during the normal
course of business and changes in deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity investments also contributed to a decrease in the valuation allowances. These decreases
were partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowances primarily due to the impact of currency devaluations in Venezuela on certain receivables.
In 
2014
, the Company recognized a net increase of $
63 million
 in its valuation allowances. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net operating losses during the normal course of
business operations and due to the remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our local Venezuelan subsidiary into U.S. dollars using the SICAD 2 exchange rate. The Company recognized a
reduction in the valuation allowances primarily due to changes in deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity investments and decreases in net operating losses during
the normal course of business operations.

NOTE 16
: 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States define fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value
are prioritized based on a three-level hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs
used to measure fair value are as follows:
•
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.
•
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. We value assets and liabilities included in this level using dealer and broker quotations, certain pricing
models, bid prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
•
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models,
discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. For our Company,
the only assets and liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity and debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale and derivative financial
instruments. Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the Company's fair value hedging strategy.
Investments in Trading and Available-for-Sale Securities
The fair values of our investments in trading and available-for-sale securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of the balance
sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in trading and available-for-sale securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar
instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer
quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the closing contract
price as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.
The fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available in public
markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for derivative instruments other
than futures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard valuation model for options also uses implied volatility as an
additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied volatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial
institutions.
Included in the fair value of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The adjustment is based on current credit default swap ("CDS") rates applied to each contract, by
counterparty. We use our counterparty's CDS rate when we are in an asset position and our own CDS rate when we are in a liability position. The adjustment for nonperformance risk did not
have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.
The gains or losses on assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are summarized in the table below (in millions):

The Company is required to record assets and liabilities that are held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell based on the agreed-upon sale price. These losses related to
refranchising activities in North America. The charges were calculated based on Level 3 inputs. Refer to Note 2.
2
 
The Company recognized losses of 
$153 million
 during the year ended 
December 31, 2016
 due to impairment charges on certain intangible assets. The charges incurred during 2016 included 
$143 million
related to the impairment of certain U.S. bottlers' franchise rights. This charge was related to a number of factors, primarily as a result of lower operating performance compared to previously modeled
results as well as a revision in management's view of the proceeds that may be ultimately received upon refranchising the territory. The 2016 losses also included a 
$10 million
 goodwill impairment charge,
primarily the result of management's revised outlook on market conditions. The charges were determined by comparing the fair value of the assets to the current carrying value. The fair value of the assets
was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level 3 inputs. Refer to Note 17.
3
 
The Company recognized losses of 
$473 million
 during the year ended 
December 31, 2015
 due to impairment charges on certain intangible assets. The charges incurred during 
2015
 included 
$418 million
of impairment charges primarily due to the discontinuation of the energy products in the glacéau portfolio as a result of the Monster Transaction and a 
$55 million
 impairment charge on a Venezuelan
trademark. The charges were determined by comparing the fair value of the assets to the current carrying value. The fair value of the assets was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level
3 inputs. Refer to Note 1, Note 2 and Note 17.
4
 
The Company recognized a loss of 
$19 million
 on our previously held investment in a South African bottler, which had been accounted for under the equity method of accounting prior to our acquisition of
the bottler in February 2015. U.S. GAAP requires the acquirer to remeasure its previously held noncontrolling equity interest in the acquired entity to fair value as of the acquisition date and recognize any
gains or losses in earnings. The Company remeasured our equity interest in the South African bottler based on Level 3 inputs. Refer to Note 2.
5
 
In 2014, the Company recognized an estimated loss of 
$32 million
 as a result of the owners of the majority interest in a Brazilian bottling entity exercising their option to acquire from us a 
10 percent
interest in the entity's outstanding shares. The exercise price was lower than our carrying value. The transaction closed in January 2015, and the Company recorded an additional loss of 
$6 million
 during the
year ended 
December 31, 2015
, calculated based on the final option price. These losses were determined using Level 3 inputs. Refer to Note 2 and Note 17.
Fair Value Measurements for Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
The fair value hierarchy discussed above is not only applicable to assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets but is also applied to certain other assets that
indirectly impact our consolidated financial statements. For example, our Company sponsors and/or contributes to a number of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Assets
contributed by the Company become the property of the individual plans. Even though the Company no longer has control over these assets, we are indirectly impacted by subsequent fair value
adjustments to these assets. The actual return on these assets impacts the Company's future net periodic benefit cost, as well as amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to
Note 13
. The Company uses the fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of assets held by our various pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

131
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents; short-term investments; receivables; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and loans and notes payable approximate their fair values
because of the relatively short-term maturities of these financial instruments.
The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted prices for those instruments. Where quoted prices are not available, fair value is estimated using
discounted cash flows and market-based expectations for interest rates, credit risk and the contractual terms of the debt instruments. As of 
December 31, 2016
, the carrying amount and fair
value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were 
$33,211 million
 and $
33,752 million
, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2015
, the carrying amount and fair value of our long-
term debt, including the current portion, were 
$30,987 million
 and $
31,308 million
, respectively.
 
NOTE 17
: 
SIGNIFICANT OPERATING AND NONOPERATING ITEMS
Other Operating Charges
In 2016, the Company recorded other operating charges of 
$1,510 million
. These charges primarily consisted of 
$352 million
 due to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program and
$240 million
 due to the integration of our German bottling operations. In addition, the Company recorded charges of 
$297 million
 related to costs incurred to refranchise certain of our bottling
operations. These costs include, among other items, internal and external costs for individuals directly working on the refranchising efforts, severance, and costs associated with the
implementation of information technology systems to facilitate consistent data standards and availability throughout our bottling systems. Additionally, the Company recorded 
$118 million
 of
pension settlement charges primarily as a result of our refranchising activities. The Company also recorded a charge of 
$200 million
 related to cash contributions we made to The Coca-Cola
Foundation, a charge of 
$76 million
 due to the write-down we recorded related to our receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela as a result of changes in exchange rates and charges of
$41 million
 related to noncapitalizable transaction costs associated with pending and closed transactions. Refer to 
Note 18
 for additional information on the Company's productivity, integration
and restructuring initiatives and Note 1 for additional information on the Venezuelan exchange rates. Refer to 
Note 19
 for the impact these charges had on our operating segments.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded charges of 
$153 million
 related to certain intangible assets. These charges included 
$143 million
 related to the impairment of
certain U.S. bottlers' franchise rights recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment. This charge was related to a number of factors, primarily as a result of lower operating
performance compared to previously modeled results as well as a revision in management's view of the proceeds that may be ultimately received upon refranchising the territory. The remaining
charge of 
$10 million
 was related to the impairment of goodwill recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment. This charge was primarily the result of management's revised outlook
on market conditions. The total impairment charges of 
$153 million
 were recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated
statement of income and were determined by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets, derived using discounted cash flow analyses, to their respective carrying values.
In 2015, the Company incurred other operating charges of 
$1,657 million
. These charges primarily consisted of $
691 million
 due to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program and
$
292 million
 due to the integration of our German bottling operations. In addition, the Company recorded impairment charges of $
418 million
 primarily due to the discontinuation of the
energy products in the glacéau portfolio as a result of the Monster Transaction and incurred a charge of $
100 million
 due to a cash contribution we made to The Coca-Cola Foundation. The
Company also incurred a charge of $
111 million
 due to the write-down of receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela and an impairment of a Venezuelan trademark primarily due to
changes in exchange rates as a result of the establishment of the new open market exchange system. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on the Company's productivity, integration and
restructuring initiatives. Refer to Note 2 for additional information on the Monster Transaction. Refer to Note 1 for additional information on the Venezuelan currency change. Refer to 
Note 19
for the impact these charges had on our operating segments.

$601 million
 due to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program and
$208 million
 due to the integration of our German bottling operations. In addition, the Company incurred a charge of 
$314 million
 due to a write-down we recorded related to receivables from
our bottling partner in Venezuela and an impairment of a Venezuelan trademark primarily due to changes in exchange rates. The write-down was recorded as a result of limited government-
approved exchange rate conversion mechanisms. The Company also recorded a loss of 
$36 million
 as a result of the restructuring and transition of the Company's Russian juice operations to an
existing joint venture with an unconsolidated bottling partner. Refer to 
Note 18

between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt extinguished, including the impact of the related fair value hedging relationship. Refer to 
Note 10
 for additional
information and 
Note 19
 for the impact this charge had on our operating segments.
Equity Income (Loss) — Net
The Company recorded net charges of 
$61 million
, $
87 million
 and $
18 million
 in equity income (loss) — net during the 
years ended
 
December 31, 2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively. These
amounts primarily represent the Company's proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. Refer to 
Note 19
 for the
impact these charges had on our operating segments.
Other Income (Loss) — Net
In 2016, other income (loss) — net was a loss of 
$1,234 million
. This loss included losses of 
$2,456 million
 due to the refranchising of certain bottling territories in North America and a loss of
$21 million
 due to the deconsolidation of our South African bottling operations and disposal of the related equity method investment in exchange for investments in CCBA and CCBA's South
African subsidiary. The Company incurred charges of 
$31 million
 related to payments made to convert the bottling agreements for certain North America bottling partners' territories to a single
form of CBA with additional requirements. Additionally, the Company incurred a charge of 
$72 million
 as a result of remeasuring its net monetary assets denominated in Egyptian pounds. The
Egyptian pound devalued as a result of the central bank allowing its currency, which was previously pegged to the U.S. dollar, to float freely. These losses were partially offset by a gain of
$1,323 million
 due to the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations and a gain of 
$18 million
 resulting from the Company's disposal of its investment in Keurig. Refer to 
Note 2
 for
additional information on the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations, the Keurig investment disposal, the deconsolidation of our South African bottling operations, the North
America refranchising and the conversion payments. Refer to

In 2015, the Company recorded a net gain of $
1,403 million
 as a result of the Monster Transaction and charges of $
1,006 million
 due to the refranchising of certain bottling territories in North
America. In addition, the Company recognized a foreign currency exchange gain of $
300 million
 associated with our foreign-denominated debt partially offset by a charge of $
27 million
 due to
the remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the SIMADI exchange rate. Refer to 
Note 2
 for additional information related to the Monster Transaction and
North America refranchising. Refer to 
Note 1
 for additional information related to the charge due to the remeasurement in Venezuela. Refer to 
Note 19
 for the impact these items had on our
operating segments.
In 2014, the Company recorded charges of 
$799 million
 due to the refranchising of certain bottling territories in North America. The Company also incurred a charge of $
372 million
 due to the
remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the SICAD 2 exchange rate. Refer to 
Note 2
 for more information related to the North America refranchising,
Note 1
 for more information related to the charge due to the remeasurement in Venezuela and 
Note 19
 for the impact these charges had on our operating segments.
 
NOTE 18
: 
PRODUCTIVITY, INTEGRATION AND RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES
Productivity and Reinvestment
In February 2012, the Company announced a four-year productivity and reinvestment program designed to further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive
long-term profitable growth. This program is focused on the following initiatives: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage
and operational excellence; data and information technology systems standardization; and the integration of Old CCE's North American bottling operations.
133
In February 2014, the Company announced the expansion of our productivity and reinvestment program to drive incremental productivity by 2016 that will primarily be redirected into
increased media investments. Our incremental productivity goal consists of two relatively equal components. First, we will expand savings through global supply chain optimization, data and
information technology systems standardization, and resource and cost reallocation. Second, we will increase the effectiveness of our marketing investments by transforming our marketing and
commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer-facing marketing investments to accelerate growth.
In October 2014, the Company announced that we were further expanding our productivity and reinvestment program and extending it through 2019. The expansion of the productivity
initiatives will focus on four key areas: restructuring the Company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget principles, across the organization;
streamlining and simplifying the Company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing investments.
The Company has incurred total pretax expenses of 
$2,408 million
 related to this program since it commenced. These expenses were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our
consolidated statement of income. Refer to 
Note 19
 for the impact these charges had on our operating segments. Outside services reported in the table below primarily relate to expenses in
connection with legal, outplacement and consulting activities. Other direct costs reported in the table below include, among other items, internal and external costs associated with the
development, communication, administration and implementation of these initiatives; accelerated depreciation on certain fixed assets; contract termination fees; and relocation costs.
The following table summarizes the balance of accrued expenses related to these productivity and reinvestment initiatives and the changes in the accrued amounts since the commencement of
the plan (in millions):

Integration Initiatives
Integration of Our German Bottling Operations
In 2008, the Company began an integration initiative related to our German bottling operations acquired in 2007. The Company incurred $
240 million
, $
292 million
 and $
208 million
 of
expenses related to this initiative in 
2016
, 
2015
 and 
2014
, respectively, and has incurred total pretax expenses of $
1,367 million
 related to this initiative since it commenced. These expenses
were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income and impacted the Bottling Investments operating segment. The expenses recorded in connection
with these integration activities have been primarily due to involuntary terminations. The Company had $
122 million
 accrued related to these integration costs as of December 31, 2015. During
the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company deconsolidated our German bottling operations. Therefore, there was no remaining accrual balance as of December 31, 2016. Refer to 
Note 2
for additional information on the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations.
134
 
NOTE 19
: 
OPERATING SEGMENTS
As of 
December 31, 2016
, our organizational structure consisted of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Bottling
Investments; and Corporate.
Segment Products and Services
The business of our Company is nonalcoholic beverages. Our geographic operating segments (Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; and Asia Pacific) derive a
majority of their revenues from the manufacture and sale of beverage concentrates and syrups and, in some cases, the sale of finished beverages. Our Bottling Investments operating segment is
composed of our Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of the geographic location of the bottler, and equity income from the majority of our equity method
investments. Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations derive the majority of their revenues from the sale of finished beverages. Generally, finished product operations produce
higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins compared to concentrate operations.
The following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues related to concentrate operations and finished product operations:

Method of Determining Segment Income or Loss
Management evaluates the performance of our operating segments separately to individually monitor the different factors affecting financial performance. Our Company manages income taxes
and certain treasury-related items, such as interest income and expense, on a global basis within the Corporate operating segment. We evaluate segment performance based on income or loss
before income taxes.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements
were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and
estimates. Financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control system is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written
policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Business Conduct adopted by our Company's Board of Directors, applicable to all officers
and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. In addition, our Company's Board of Directors adopted a written Code of Business Conduct for Non-Employee Directors which reflects the
same principles and values as our Code of Business Conduct for officers and employees but focuses on matters of relevance to non-employee Directors.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2016
. In making
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) ("COSO") in 
Internal Control —
Integrated Framework
. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2016
.
The Company's independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, subject to
ratification by our Company's shareowners. Ernst & Young LLP has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries and the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors are contained in this annual report.
140
Audit Committee's Responsibility
The Audit Committee of our Company's Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are independent in accordance with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing
standards, the Exchange Act, and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal
controls and auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets
periodically with the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present to ensure that the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor have free access to the
Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee's Report can be found in the Company's 2017 Proxy Statement.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Shareowners
The Coca-Cola Company
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries as of 
December 31, 2016
 and 
2015
, and the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, shareowners' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 2016
. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries at 
December 31,
2016
 and 
2015
, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 2016
, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries' internal control over
financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2016
, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated February 24, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Board of Directors and Shareowners
The Coca-Cola Company
We have audited The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2016
, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated
Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries'
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in
the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2016
, based on the COSO
criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Coca-Cola Company and
subsidiaries as of 
December 31, 2016

The sum of the quarterly net income per share amounts does not agree to the full year net income per share amounts. We calculate net income per share based on the weighted-average number of
outstanding shares during the reporting period. The average number of shares fluctuates throughout the year and can therefore produce a full year result that does not agree to the sum of the individual
quarters.
Our first quarter, second quarter and third quarter reporting periods end on the Friday closest to the last day of the applicable quarterly calendar period. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year end on
December 31 regardless of the day of the week on which December 31 falls.

OVERSEAS RETIREMENT PLAN
AS AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2007
WHEREAS, Section 7.1 of The Coca-Cola Export Corporation Overseas Retirement Plan, as amended and restated effective October 1,
2007 (the “Plan”) provides that the Global Benefits Committee (the “Committee”) has the authority to amend the Plan; and
WHEREAS, the Committee desires to amend the Plan to make certain changes;
NOW, THEREFORE, the Committee hereby amends the Plan as follows effective as of the dates specified herein.
1.
Section 5.1(B) is amended as follows:
“5.1 
    
Separation on or after Normal Retirement Date
.
B. 
    
Old Age Benefits and Separation Payments
1.
    
The Actuarial Equivalent in dollars computed at an appropriate rate of exchange as determined by the Committee of
the annual amount which the Member has received, is receiving, or would become eligible to receive as an old age benefit under
the laws of any national, regional, or local government or agency thereof and/or termination, liquidation, premium, or bonus
payments which any Employer must according to law pay or have had to pay the Member at cessation of active service or transfer
to another country. If such old age benefit and/or other payment or payments are not payable to the Member in an annuity form
commencing on his retirement date, then such amounts which could have commenced on or before his retirement date shall be
converted to an Actuarial Equivalent annuity commencing on the Member’s retirement date for determining amounts under this
Part B. Any such payments which the Member shall not become eligible to begin receiving until after his retirement shall not
initially be considered an offset under this Part B, but shall become part of this Part B at such time as the Member shall become
eligible to begin receiving such payments. In the event any such benefits are due or partially due to the Member’s own
contributions or are partially due to Years of Vesting Service not included in Years of Benefit Service, amounts to be determined
under this Part B shall be derived only from that portion of such benefits reasonably assumed by the Committee to be due to
payments or contributions by the Employer for periods of employment included in Years of Benefit Service. For Members who
terminate employment with the Company or a Subsidiary on or after October 1, 2006, if such benefit is estimated to be less than
USD $100 per month, determined as of the applicable normal retirement age or when eligible for the offset, whichever is earlier,
then no offset will be applied for that particular benefit.
2.
    
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following calculations will be used for Participants Who Are not Grandfathered
Members for certain benefits and payments received after December 31, 2011.
a.
    
Lump Sum Benefit
The lump sum in dollars computed at an appropriate rate of exchange as determined by the Committee of the amount which the
Member has received, is receiving, or would become eligible to receive as a termination, liquidation, premium, or bonus payments
which any Employer must according to law pay or have had to pay the Member at cessation of active service or transfer to another
country. In the event any such benefits are due or partially due to the Member’s own contributions or are partially due to Years of
Vesting Service not included in Years of Benefit Service, amounts to be determined under this Part B shall be derived only from
that portion of such benefits reasonably assumed by the Committee to be due to payments or contributions by the Employer for
periods of employment included in Years of Benefit Service.
b.
    
Annuity Benefit
The Actuarial Equivalent (converted to a lump sum) in dollars computed at an appropriate rate of exchange as determined by the
Committee of the annual amount which the Member has received, is receiving, or would become eligible to receive as a
termination, liquidation, premium, or bonus payments which any Employer must according to law pay or have had to pay the
Member at cessation of active service or transfer to another country. In the event any such benefits are due or partially due to the
Member’s own contributions or are partially due to Years of Vesting Service not included in Years of Benefit Service, amounts to
be determined under this Part B shall be derived only from that portion of such benefits reasonably assumed by the Committee to
be due to payments or contributions by the Employer for periods of employment included in Years of Benefit Service.”
Except as specifically amended hereby, the Plan shall remain in full force and effect as prior to this Amendment Four.

As of

, the Company was contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties, including certain variable interest entities, in the amount of
$
587 million
. Fixed charges for these contingent liabilities have not been included in the computation of the above ratios, as the amounts are immaterial and, in the opinion of
management, it is not probable that the Company will be required to satisfy the guarantees. The interest amount in the above table does not include interest expense associated
with unrecognized tax benefits.
