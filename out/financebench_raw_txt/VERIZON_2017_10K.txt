Communications Inc. and subsidiaries, which are incorporated by reference into this report.
Wireless
Backgr ound
Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications products and services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the
U.S. Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the U.S. as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2017, Verizon Wireless had 116.3
million retail connections and 2017 revenues of approximately $87.5 billion, representing approximately 69% of V erizon’ s aggregate revenues.
Cellco Partne rship (Cellco ), which originally held the wireless assets of Bell Atlantic, began operating as "Verizon Wireless" in April 2000 with both Vodafone Group Plc
(Vodafone) and Bell Atlantic as partners, following Vodafone’ s contribution of its U.S. wireless assets into Cellco. We acquired all of Vodafone’ s indirect 45% interest in
Verizon W ireless in 2014, which resulted in full ownership of V erizon W ireless.
We have the largest fourth -generation (4G) Long-T erm Evolution (LTE) technology network of any U.S. wireless service provider . Our 4G LTE network is available to over
98% of the U.S. population  in more than 500 markets  covering approximately 319 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under
this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier ’s network assets and our core 4G
LTE equipment and 700 MHz C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. Approximately 98.5% of our total data traffic in 2017 was carried on our 4G LTE
network.
Over the past several years , we have been leading the development of fifth-generation ( 5G) wireless techn ology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G
wireless services. We conti nue to work with key partners on innovation, standards development and requir ements for this next generation of wireless technology . During 2017,
we deployed the largest 5G trial network in the U.S. with active customers. In November 2017, we announced that we will commercially launch 5G wireless residential
broadband services in three to five U.S. markets in 2018.
Wireless Service and Pr oduct Offerings
Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand, customers that obtain wireless products and services that operate on
our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis and customers that utilize Internet of Things (IoT) services via our network.

Wireless Services
We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are
directly serve d and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A
retail postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a custom er is billed one month in advance a monthly access charge in return
for access to and usage of network service.  Approximately 95% of our total retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2017. Our prepaid service enables
individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance.
We offer various postpaid account service plans, including unlimited plans, shared data plans, single connection plans and other plans tailored to the needs of our customers.
Our unlimited plans, availa ble to our consumer and business customers, offer, among other things, unlimited domestic voice, data and texting. Our shared data plans typically
feature domes tic unlimited  voice minutes, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, and a single data allowance that can be shared among the
wireless devic es on a custo mer’s account. These allowances will vary from time to time as part of promo tional offers or in response to market circumstances. Our unlimited
and shared data plans include High Definition (HD)  Voice and Video Calling on compatible devices, and certain plans also include Mobile Hotspot services on compatible
devices. Our HD Voice services, enabled by Voice over LTE (VoLTE), deliver calls over our 4G LTE network, and our Video Calling service combines an HD Voice call with
real-time video. Our Mobile Hotspot service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot that can provide Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. Our
unlimited plans provide customers the ability to stream DVD or HD quality videos, based on the service plan. We also offer various voice and shared data plans for small and
large business customers.
Customers on our fixed-te rm service plans historica lly paid higher access fees for their wireless service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless devices at
subsidized prices. As of January 2017, we no longer offer consumers new fixed-term service plans for phones; however , we continue to offer subsidized plans to our business
customers, and we also continue to service existing fixed-term plans as consumers move to unsubsidized pricing driven by the activation of devices purchased under the
Verizon device payment program. Under this program, eligible customers can purchase wireless device s under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate
service on such devices pay lower service fees as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans.
We also offer prepaid single connection service plans that feature domestic unlimited voice minutes and unlimited domestic and international text. On compatible devices,
certain of our prepaid plans  also feature video and picture messaging, Carryover Data and Always-On Data, which allows a customer to stay online at reduced data speeds after
using their data allowance.  HD Voice, Video Calling and Mobile Hotspot service are available on compatib le devices. While each of our prepaid plans has traditionally covered
a single line of service for one device, in 2017, we expanded our prepaid offerings by giving families the ability to combine individual prepaid plans and choose the data
allotment for each member of the family . As with all of our prepaid plans, the family plan does not require an annual contract or credit check.
We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Acces s to the Internet is available on all smartphones and nearly all basic
phones. W e also of fer service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G
LTE or third generation (3G) modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as USB modems, Jetpacks™ and other
dedicated devices that provide a mobile W i-Fi connection.
Our customers can access multimedia offerings, provided by Verizon and by third parties, through applications that provide music, video, gaming, news and other content. Our
business-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity , include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet, their corporate intranets and e-mail
across our diverse portfoli o of wireless devices. Our location-based services provide our customers with directions to their destination and enable our business customers to
locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our international travel services allow our customers to access voice, text and data services and the Internet
on many of our "W orld" 3G or 4G smartphones, tablets or basic phones from over 200 international destinations.
We also provide network access needed to deliver various IoT products and services. In addition, we work with various companies that purchase network access from us to
connect their Open Development certified devices, bundled together with their own solutions, which they sell to end-users.
Wireless Devices
We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices, manufactured by various suppliers.
Smartphones and Basic Phones. All of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE high-speed data services and some are also enabled to utilize 3G as well.
These devices run on various operating systems. W e offer both 3G enabled and 4G enabled basic phones that also have HTML-browsing capabilities.
Tablets and Other Internet Devices.  We offer tablets that can access the Internet via our 4G LTE network or a Wi-Fi connection. In addition, we offer dedicated devices, which
we refer to as JetpacksTM, that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G connection and are capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the Internet at one time.
Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly  at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and
netbooks enabled to access our wireless network.

Wearables. Customers can also choose  from connected wearable devices that allow for calls, text, and other notifications when they are away from their compatible phones.
These smart watches can share the same mobile number as the customer ’s phone, allowing for seamless communications on-the-go.
Network
We have the largest 4G LTE network of any service provider in the U.S., with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous U.S. Metropolitan areas. As of
December 31, 2017, our 4G LTE network covered approximately 319 million people in the U.S., includi ng those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. We
currently have 22 L TE in Rural America partners that provide 4G L TE coverage to an area covering approximately three million people.
We consider the reliability of our wireless network as a key factor for our continued success and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their
wireless services. We believe that steady and consiste nt network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable
growth.
We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, permitting the completion of
large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and also maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and
completed without being dropped. We have been densifying our 4G LTE network by utilizing small cell technology , in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems.
Network densification not only enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services, but also
positions us for the future deployment of 5G technology . We are also utilizing existing network capabilit ies to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the
customer experience. We have and will continue to deploy advanced technologies such as higher orders of modulation, 4x4 multiple input multiple output, licensed assistance
access, and increased cell site density primarily through small cell deployment. Just over 50% of our available low- and mid-band spectrum portfolio is being used for 4G L TE.
Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we
have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at every switch location. In
addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label
Switching backbone network in critical locations.
In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless servi ce providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in
nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming
arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the U.S. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at-will by either party upon several months’ notice;
however , we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse ef fect on our business.
Technology
Our primary network technology platform is 4G LTE, which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G
technologies.
We use HD Calling, enabled by V oLTE, in addition to 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology , to provide voice calling services to our customers.
We are committed to developing and deploying 5G wireless technology . We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G
requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. W e expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current
4G LTE technology , lower latency and enable our network to handle more traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. We intend to be the first company to
deploy a 5G fixed wireles s broadband network in the U.S. Based on the outcome of our pre-commercial trials in 2017, we announced in November 2017 that we will
commercially launch 5G wireless residential broadband services in three to five U.S. markets in 2018.
Our Intelligent Edge Network is aggressively evolving our network architecture to a multi-use platform built on deep fiber penetration, providing increased virtualization and
opportunities for edge computing services.
Spectrum
The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobil e wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to provide these wireless services on porti ons of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellula r spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal
Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively ,
cover nearly all of the population of the U.S.
In 2017, we entered into transactions to acquire NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink) and Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path), each of which hold millimeter -
wave spectrum  licenses. The NextLink acquisition closed on January 10, 2018. The Straight Path acquisition  is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018.  The
spectrum acquired as part of these transactions will be used for our 5G technology deployment in the 28 and 39 GHz bands.
5
Table of Contents
In January 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band.  We participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum
licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015.
We are aggressively refarming 3G bands on 800 MHz and PCS bands for 4G LTE use. We anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This
increasing demand is drive n by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of
speed. We can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and
when future FCC spectrum auctions occur . In additi on to spectrum, we believe that future demand will also be met as we increase the density of our networks and deploy
advanced technologies.
From time to time we have  exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue
similar oppor tunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. In certain cases, we have entered into intra market spectrum swaps
designed to increase the amount of contiguous spect rum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency .
These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses.
Additional information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2017 Verizon Annu al Report to Shareowners in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements of V erizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.
Network Equipment and Build-out
As we continue to build and upgrade our existing LTE network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining
zoning and other governm ental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells. As we densify our network, we follow a similar process for small cells, in-
building syste ms and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various
products and services that support our network operations. W e utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites.
During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower), pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to
lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wirele ss towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American Tower has exclusive
rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these
towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion. We have subleased
capacity on the towers from American T ower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew .
Marketing and Distribution
Our marketing strategy is focused on offering solution s tailored to the needs of our various customer marke t groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution
network; and jointly marketing our products and services to lar ge business and government customers with V erizon’ s Wireline businesses through the W ireless Business Group,
a sales  and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizon Wireless’ solutions for medium and large business, and Verizon Wireline's Enterprise Solutions group,
which serves all of our government customers. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media
promotions designed to present our corporate messag e consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in
order to increase customer growth while controlling customer acquisition costs.
Our direct channel include s our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers
and local, regional and national business customers. Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy . We continue to redesign our retail stores
nationwide into the "Next Gen Design," which focuses on our customer's evolving digital lifestyle. We also have Verizon Destination Stores in various major metropolitan
areas, which focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. 
Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the U.S., as well as through the Internet.
The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with
high-profile national retailers, which sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services, and with various drugstore chains, which sell our prepaid products and
services.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry . We compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc., Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc.,
as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless
service providers for resale, including resellers that buy from us. Competition remains intense as a result of saturation in the wireless market, increased network investment by
our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional
spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulator y changes. Competition may also increase as smaller , stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to
larger, better capitalized wireless service providers.

Table of Contents
The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeki ng to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue
with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others are
offering alternative means for making wireless voice  calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider ’s voice service, as well as alternative means of
accessing video content.
We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry:
• Network reliability , capacity and coverage.  We consider a wireless network that consistently provides high-quality and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the
U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content,
have led to increased custo mer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively , wireless service providers
must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that the depth and breadth of our network
provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage in the wireless marketplace. We expect that our investments in our 4G LTE network to
increase network capacity will enable us to meet consumer demand.
• Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape, with plans that address both the postpaid and prepaid customer . As
the demand for wireless services continues to grow , we and other wireless service providers are offering service plans at competitive prices that include unlimited data
access, voice minutes and text messages, and we also offer plans with data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes. We and many other wireless service providers
also allow customers on certain plans to carry over unused data allowances to the next billing period, or to stay online at a reduced data speed after using all of a data
allowance for a billing period. In addition, some wireless service providers have bundled wireless service offerings with other products while others offer promotional
pricing and incentives tar geted specifically to customers of V erizon W ireless.
We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment optio ns that distinguish service pricing from equipment pricing and
blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device payment plans, which provide customers with the ability to pay
for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically , wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby , in exchange for
the customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service provider significantly , and in some cases fully, subsidized the customer ’s device purchase.
Wireless providers recover ed those subsidies through  higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device payment plans. We and many other wireless
providers have limited or discontinued this form of device subsidy . As of December 31, 2017 we had approximately 80% of our postpaid phone base on unsubsidized
service pricing plans, compared with approximately 67% at December 31, 2016. As of January 2017, we no longer offer consumers new fixed-term service plans for
phones. However we continue to service existing plans and provide these plans to business customers.
• Customer service. We believe that high-quali ty customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless
providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customer s with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and
focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also
focused on improving in this area. As part of our effort to transform and simplify the customer experience, we developed the My Verizon app, which enables customers to
manage their price plan, data usage, account and billing from their devices. To promote long-term relationships with our customers, we launched the Verizon Up program,
which offers a variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related transactions with Verizon Wireless. The program
offers customers discounts on products, services and access to experiences, such as sporting events, shows and concerts.
• Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be
increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and
innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers. We also collaborate with various device
manufacturers in the devel opment of distinctive smar tphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over
the Internet. W e continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our customer base.
• Sales and distribution. The key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that
attaining the optimal comb ination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leadi ng profitability , as measured by operating income. We endeavor
to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect
distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of laptops and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G modules
that can acces s the Internet on our network at broadband speeds. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their
end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their IoT devices or services.
• Capital r esour ces. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant
capital resources. W e generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors.

Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless  industry . These include the factors described above, as well as new
technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic  trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies that bundle the
services of wireless and cable competitors.
Wireline
Backgr ound
Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, inclu ding broadband video and data services, corporate networking
solutions, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide  these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to
carriers, busin esses and government customers both in the U.S. and around the world.  In 2017, Wireline revenues were $30.7 billion, representing approximately 24% of
Verizon’ s aggregate revenues.
During the first quarter of 2017, Verizon reorganized  the customer groups within its Wireline segment. Previously , the customer groups in the Wireline segment consisted of
Mass Markets (which included Consumer Retail and Small Business subgroups), Global Enterprise, and Global Wholesale. Pursuant to the reorganization, there are now four
customer groups within the Wireline segment: Consumer Markets, which includes the customers previousl y included in Consumer Retail; Enterprise Solutions, which includes
the large business custom ers, including multinational corporations, and federal government customers previously included in Global Enterprise; Partner Solutions, which
includes the customers previously included in Global Wholesale; and Business Markets, a new customer group, which includes U.S.-based small business customers previously
included in Mass Markets  and U.S.-based medium business customers, state and local government customers and educational institutions previously included in Global
Enterprise.
To compensate for the shrinking market for traditiona l copper based products (such as voice services), we continue to build our Wireline business around a fiber-based network
supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We are reinventing our network architecture
around a common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline businesses. We expect our One Fiber "multi-use fiber" initiative will aid in the densification of
our 4G LTE wireless netwo rk and position us for the future deployment of 5G technology . The expansion of our multi-use fiber footprint also creates opportunities to generate
revenue from  fiber-based services in our Wireline business. We continue to seek ways to increase reven ue, further realize operating and capital efficiencies and maximize
profitability across the segment.
Strategic T ransactions
In April 2016, we completed the sale (Access Line Sale) of our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet
and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states to Frontier Communications
Corporation (Frontier) for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6
billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier . The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange
carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and T exas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of V erizon W ireless.
The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the
related ILEC businesses from V erizon. Approximately 9,300 V erizon employees who served customers in California, Florida and T exas continued employment with Frontier .
In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2017, with Equinix , Inc. (Equinix)  pursuant to which we agreed to sell
23 customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately  $3.6 billion , subject to certain adjustments  (Data Center Sale) . The transaction closed in
May 2017.
The operating results of these businesses are excluded from our Wireline segment for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the
information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .
In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire  XO Holdings’ wireline business (XO), which owned and operate d one of the largest fiber-based  Internet
Protocol (IP) and Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently , we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO
Holdings,  NextLink, that holds its wireless spectrum, which included an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy the subsidiary . In February 2017, we completed our
acquisition of XO for total cash consideration of approximately  $1.5 billion , of which  $0.1 billion  was paid in 2015 .
In April 2017, we exercised our option to buy NextL ink for approximately  $0.5 billion , subject to certain adjustments. The transaction closed in January 2018. The spectrum
acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment.
In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreem ent to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from  WideOpenW est, Inc. (WOW! ), a leading
provider of communicatio ns services. The transactio n closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! will
complete the build-out of the network assets we acquired by the second half of 2018. The total cash consideration for the transactions is expected to be approximately  $0.3
billion , of which  $0.2 billion  is related to the transaction that closed in December 2017.

Partner Solutions
Partner Solutions provides communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance, and wireless carriers that use
our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2017, Partner Solutions revenues were $4.9 billion, representing approximately 16% of Wireline’ s aggregate revenues. A
portion of Partner Solutions revenues are generated by a few lar ge telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us.
Partner Solutions provides the following key services to both W ireless and W ireline carriers:
• Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers’ networks and provide connections to
their end-user s and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Wavelength services, as well as core time-division
multiplexing (TDM) data circuits, such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated local

Table of Contents
Verizon operates a large and advanced telecommunications network in the U.S. and around the world to provide services and solutions to its customers. With the advancement
of our Intelligent Edge Network; we are evolving our network architecture around a multi-use comm on fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline
technologies and will, we believe, drive even greater levels of cost efficiency . We expect that the new architecture will improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of
5G technology , deliver high-speed Fios broadband to homes and businesses, and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market.
• Fios. Our fiber-to-the-home network through which we provide our Fios residential broadband service has passed over 17.3 million premises in the U.S. as of December
31, 2017. Residential broad band service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow .
The continued emer gence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements
for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technolo gy underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these
demands in a cost-ef fective and efficient manner . Our PON technology provides the flexibility to adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services
without major overhauls or replacements to the fiber -optic infrastructure.
While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, the PON infrastructure is also finding more  widespread application in the enterprise sector , especially as
businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services.
• Global IP . Verizo n owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150 countries. Our
global IP network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 900,000 route miles and enable and support far reaching international operations.
Global business is rapidly evolving to an "everything-as-a-service" model in which business customers seek cloud-based, conver ged enterprise solutions delivered
securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy , Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global
network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology . The result is a global IP network that can offer powerful solutions to these
service demands.
We believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments,
will help V erizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential, small to medium business, Government and enterprise customers.
Competition
The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emer ging players seeking
increased market share. Current and potential compe titors include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite
television companies, Internet service providers, over the top providers and other companies that of fer network services and managed enterprise solutions.
In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service
providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large
contracts to provide integra ted services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong marke t presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all
of which contribute to intensifying competition that may af fect our future revenue growth.
We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry:
• Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability . Consumers and small business customers are seeking to leverage fast and reliable connections for entertainment,
communications and productivity . As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and
other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing bandwidth requirements.  In addition, network reliability and security are
increasingly important competitive factors for our Enterprise Solutions and Business Markets customers, which include State, Local and Education (SLED), and Small
and Medium Business (SMB) customers. W e continue to invest in our network to be able to meet growing bandwidth demand and provide reliable and secure networks.
• Pricing. Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a
significant factor as non-tr aditional modes of providing communication services emer ge and new entrant s compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based
calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues.
• Customer service.  Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area is
important for customer acquisition and retention. For our Consumer Markets and Business Markets customers, we compete in this area through our service
representatives and online support. We provide our Enterprise Solutions customers with ready access to their system and performance information and we conduct
proactive testing of our network to identify issues before they affect their customers. In the Partner Solutions business, we believe service improvement can be achieved
through continued system automation initiatives.

• Product differ entiation. As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to
applications and are seekin g ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Conver ged featur es, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality , are
becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement.
• Innovation. The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively , providers need to continuously review , improve and
refine their product portfolio and customer service experience and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of the customer .
In the Consum er Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital
products and services. We continue to market compet itive bundled offerings that include Fios Internet, TV, and voice services. In addition, in 2017 we introduced market offers
targeted to our V erizon W ireless customers. Several major cable operators also of fer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.
Customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a TV, computer , tablet or mobile phone. We expect
the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to over the top of ferings.
We expect customer migration from traditional voice  services to wireless services to continue as a growin g number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless
companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable  companies and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet
portal providers.
In the Enterprise Solutions market, competition remains intense, primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology conver gence. We compete in this area with
system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. In addition, some of the biggest compa nies in IT services are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-
strategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emer ging fields,
such as cloud computing, software delivery , commu nication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also
utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers.
In the Partner  Solutions business, we serve as a global wholesale partner that connects customers to the digital world. Partner Solutions competes with traditional carriers for
long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile  video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche
players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity .
In Business Markets, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity with a consumer -like "look and feel" are becoming key
differentiators for both our SMB and SLED customers. SMB customers are seeking full life-cycle offers that radically simplify the process of starting, running and growing
their businesses, while SLED customers want simila r services that are high quality and secure that enab le material improvement in citizen outreach, public safety and city
infrastructure performance, all of which help attract inward investment and community prosperity .
Media and T elematics
Technology developments, interconnected markets, shifting consumer needs and conver ging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for Verizon.  We are
transforming around the capabilities of our high-perfo rming networks, with a goal of future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world.
Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network conne ctivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms in digital media and IoT, and
deliver solutio ns to key industry segments for incremental monetization. Verizon is focused on leveraging all of our assets to create innovative products and services that can
provide our customers with integrated solutions that address their needs. Several strategic initiatives have been undertaken by Verizon in the areas of digital media, interactive
entertainment and IoT (including telematics) products and services.
Media
Verizon has been investing  in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. We have been investing in video assets and capabilities
with a goal of building a global platform and develo ping new business models for reaching the digital video customer . We believe the growth in video consumption using
mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth. Through various acquisitions and investments and the launch of video streaming products and services, we
are expanding the ways in which we can deliver content to our customers, including the following:
• In June 2015, we complet ed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL), a leader in digital content and adverti sing. AOL ’s business model aligns with our approach, and we
believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams.
• In June 2017, we complete d our acquisition of the operating business of Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo), a leader in search, communications, digital content and advertising. Yahoo
informs, connects and entertains through its search, communications and digital content products. Yahoo also connects advertisers with target audiences through a
streamlined advertising technology stack that utilizes  a combination of data, content and technology . Verizon has combined Yahoo's operating business with our existing
Media business, which included AOL's operations and the content delivery platform of Verizon Digital Media Services (VDMS), to create a new organization named
Oath, which
12
Table of Contents
includes diverse media and technology brands that engage approximately a billion people around the world. We believe that Oath, with its technology , content and data,
will help us expand the global scale of our digital media business and build brands for the future.  Additional discussion of the transaction is included in the 2017 Verizon
Annual Repo rt to Shareowners in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference
into this report.
• We continue to invest in VDMS, which offers a scala ble platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand, games, software and websites, to our
customers on their devices at any time. As the digita l platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content, there is an increasing need for a stable, high-
quality video  delivery platform. We are focused on providing a simple end-to-end global platform for the delivery of media to consumers, which we believe will be
superior to that offered by the existing and highly fragmented media delivery ecosystem. This platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies and other
businesses focused on delivering their digital produc ts and services through the Internet. We also expect, through the VDMS platform, to support video initiatives and
offerings, such as Fios and wireless, across the business.
• We have established relationships with leading sports leagues to bring compelling content to our customers across our digital platforms. We recently announced a multi-
year partnership with the National Football League (NFL) in which Verizon’ s portfolio of premium digital and mobile media properties, such as Yahoo Sports, will stream
in-market and national games, including national pre-season, regular season and playof f games, and the Super Bowl to mobile phones. We also recently announced an
innovative, multi-year partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) that will deliver one of the most comprehensive video streaming offerings of NBA
content - from live out-of- market games via NBA League Pass to highlights, fantasy basketball, original programming and more via Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Fantasy and
across Verizo n’s family of media brands. As part of the partnership, the NBA and Verizon will unveil a series of innovative collaborations leveraging Verizon's leading
network and technology to deliver premium NBA content and unique fan experiences. Verizon also has rights to deliver leading soccer games, including La Liga and Liga
MX, to its customers.
• We have made investment s in conver ging technolog ies and services involving content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming and related consumer hardware to
leverage new content mode ls. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity . We
began using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) technology to develop our LTE Multicast service.  MBMS has the potential to enhance our network
efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually no buf fering, regardless of the number of devices using the service.
• During 2016, we established Verizon Hearst Media Partners, LLC, a content joint venture with Hearst Entertainment & Syndication (Hearst), to build new multiplatform
digital video channels targeted to the mobile millennial audience. In partnership with Hearst, we have also invested in two media companies, AwesomenessTV Holdings,
LLC and Com plex Media, Inc., which are leaders in producing content targeted at key demographics, in order to further diversify our content and distribution businesses
within our digital media portfolio.
Internet of Things and T elematics
The adoption of IoT technology continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging IoT technologies to increase efficiency , gain better customer
insights, facilitate compliance and build new business models. IoT growth is expanding broadly , and adoption is particularly strong in the telematics and transportation
industries in addition to the fields of smart communities, healthcare, utilities and energy management. We are building IoT capabilities by leveraging business models that
monetize usage on our network at the connectivity , platform and solution layers. We have developed IoT solutions that address key market needs for electric and other utilities,
farms and other purveyors of food and agriculture, drug companies and others with complex supply chains. In addition, our IoT customers can turn the data that our solutions
provide into actionable opportunities to develop new services and create revenue growth.
Our IoT services of fer end-to-end solutions for various IoT vertical markets, such as:
• Fleet management and telematics.  We provide in-vehicle solutions that enable vehicle  navigation, GPS tracking, engine diagnostic monitoring and maintenance

energy usage; and
• Smart Communities.  Our solutions enable local ities to collect data from IoT and connected machine technologies with the goal of improving public safety , managing
traffic, reducing pollution, identifying revenue generation opportunities, making ef ficient use of limited resources and attracting businesses, residents and workers.
Through Verizon Telematic s, we are automating, and helping our customers to optimize, the way people, vehicles and things move through the world. Our telematics business
offers a full array of solutions to both businesses and consumers that combine location-based software , services and data intelligence. We enable our customers to track,
safeguard and optimize their most prized assets: people, vehicles, equipment and data. Through organic and inorganic growth, Verizon has built one of the largest telematics
businesses worldwide based on its advanced mobile telematics platforms.
Our consume r offering is anchored by our Hum product. Hum is an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service that provides consumers with diagnostic
technology in their vehicles, access to live assistance and roadside assistance with GPS accuracy when needed. Our Hum service also offers the ability to connect with a
certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and of fer solutions. Since its market
13
Table of Contents
introduction in 2015, Hum has grown rapidly , becoming one of the largest consumer telematics platform s in North America. We also offer consumer telematics services via
automotive OEMs such as Mercedes Benz, V olkswagen and others in select markets.
Verizon Telem atics has also developed one of the largest commercial telematics businesses worldwide. In addition to our Networkfleet business, in 2016 we acquired both
Fleetmatics Group PLC, a global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions, and Telogis, Inc., a global, cloud-based mobile enterprise management
software business. With these combined businesses, Verizon Telematics is a top commercial telematics provider globally . We serve both the enterprise and SMB market
segments with advanced solutions and scale in distribution, research and development, and customer support.
Patents, T rademarks and Licenses
We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue
the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad.
We also activ ely grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable
them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their produc ts and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage
of the results  of Verizon’ s research and developmen t efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to us, we do not believe that the loss of such
consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material ef fect on our results of operations.
We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We
also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us
directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease
offering the relevant products or services.
Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Information about our acquisitions and divestitures is included in the 2017  Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading "Management’ s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions and Divestitures" and in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and
subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.
Regulatory and Competitive T rends
Regulatory and Competitive Landscape
Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competi tive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless
companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional companies. Many of
these compan ies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our
future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary
regulator . The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act
or Act). Other V erizon services are subject to state and local regulation.
Federal Regulation
Wireless Services
The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally , the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless
communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon
anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for license d spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others,
or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions.
Today , Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC
spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While  the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’ s wireless licenses,
challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that
license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers
to use device s and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including
construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless
tower and antenna facilities.

Table of Contents
Broadband
Verizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally , the FCC recognized broadband Internet  access services as "information services" subject to a "light touch"
regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. In 2015, the FCC declared that broadband Internet access services are "telecommunications
services" subject to commo n carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order reversing the 2015 Title II Order to
return to "light touch" regulation of broadband Internet access services. Regardless of regulation, Verizon  remains committed to the open Internet, which provides consumers
with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our

Verizon offers many different wireline voice services,  including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes,
legacy telephone services are generally considered to be "common carrier" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to
rates, terms and conditions  and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply
with certain rules, such as 91 1 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.
Video
Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also
generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local
authorities.
Privacy and Data Security
We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless,
broadband and the develop ment and roll out of new products, such as those in the media and IoT space. At the federal level, our voice business is subject to the FCC's privacy
requirements. Oversight of broadband Internet access privacy and data security , which had shifted from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the FCC following the FCC's
adoption of its 2015 Title II Order , will return to the FTC as a result of the FCC's repeal of the 2015 Title II Order in December 2017. Generally , attention to privacy and data
security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level. In addition, a new data protection regulation will go into effect in Europe in May 2018 that includes
significant penalties for non-compliance.
Public Safety and Cybersecurity
The FCC has played a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emer gency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media
(broadcast/cable) and wireless emer gency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurre d or could occur in the future, however , the FCC or other regulators
may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers.
Inter carrier Compensation and Network Access
The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other
aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline "business data services" and other
services and network facili ties. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. In April 2017, the FCC issued an
order , which is currently under appeal, that revised the regulatory structure for business data services, eliminating tariffing obligations and ex ante price regulations in markets
the FCC determined to be competitive. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for
business data services may be appropriate.
State Regulation and Local Regulation
Wireless Services
The Act generally preempt s regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating
the other "terms and condit ions" of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several
states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna
facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.
Wireline Services
State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’ s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an "incumbent local
exchange carrier" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and
requirements. V erizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated.

Table of Contents
In addition, as a video services operator in many states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide
franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations, as a result.
Envir onmental Matters
Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to
address conta mination at the site of a former Sylvani a facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army
Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the
contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the
parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The following discussion of "Risk Factors" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect  our business, operations, financial condition or futur e performance.
This information should be read in conjunction with "Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Result of Operations" and the consolidated financial
statements and related notes. The following discuss ion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when
evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our futur e results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in
forwar d-looking statements.
Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations.
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession  or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our
products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer
higher margin services, dropping down in price plans  or obtaining lower -cost products and services offered  by other companies. Similarly , under these conditions, the business
customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic
conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur , it could have a material
adverse ef fect on our results of operations.
We face significant competition that may reduce our profits.
We face significant competition in our industry . The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among
wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies,
wireless servi ce providers,  satellite providers, applic ation and device providers and providers of VoIP services. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of
products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly
altering the financial relatio nships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided –
in some cases specifically targeting Verizon Wireless customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality , capacity and
coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of
our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry ,
including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are
not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits.
If we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consume r demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the
demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits.
Our industries  are rapidly changing as new technolog ies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the
markets we serve. In order  to grow and remain comp etitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology , enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings
to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose
customers to our competito rs. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the succes s of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or
regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and
introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely af fected.
In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-ef fective
basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.
We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business.
We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment,
smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide produc ts to our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device
suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipset s, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide
equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our
customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one
supplier to another , our business could be substantia lly disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with
products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating
efficiencies and have a material adverse ef fect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The suppliers and vendors  on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent
infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry . We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We
expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology .

Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely af fect our business prospects or results of operations.
Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencie s, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign
governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified
products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often
involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the
outcome of pending federa l and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing
laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly , we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in
obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10
years, subject  to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a mate rial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our
wireline and wireless networks and operate our Media and Telematics businesses, impose additional costs , impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to
provide servic es in a mann er that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, we are subje ct to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data
protection. A new data protection regulation will go into effect in Europe in May 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In an order adopted by the FCC
in December 2017, the FCC repealed its 2015 Title II Order that had nullified its longstanding "light touch" approach to regulating broadband Internet access services and
"reclassified" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The December 2017 order could be appealed or otherwise
challenged. The outcome and timing of any such appeal or challenge remains uncertain. In addition, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called
"open access"  FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover , certain
services could  be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and
introducing new services. The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the
marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.
Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse ef fect on our business.
Cyber attacks , including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for
obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse
effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable
technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations. Cybe r attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in
frequency , scope and poten tial harm in recent years. Further , the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed
by company employees or external actors operating in any geography , including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or
ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. Cyber attacks may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of
service is an objective of the attacker . While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks which , individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's
operations or financial condition, the preventive actio ns we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be
insuf ficient to repel or mitigate the ef fects of a major cyber attack in the future.
The inability to operate or use our networks and syste ms or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of
time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon
could include  expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their busin ess, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of
alternate resources, lost revenues from business interr uption and litigation. The potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain.
Further , certain of V erizon’ s businesses, such as those of fering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively af fected if our
ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Moreover , our increasing presence in the IoT industry with offerings of
telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to poten tial costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber
attacks impac ting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and
sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation,
adversely impact customer and investor confidence, and could further result in a material adverse ef fect on V erizon’ s results of operation or financial condition.
Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.
Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could
cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degra dation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain
insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy
may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the
suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide  products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing
significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these
occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.

Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if V erizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt.
As of December 31, 2017 , Verizon had approximately $108.2 billion of outst anding unsecured indebtedness, as well as approximately $8.9 billion  of unused borrowing
capacity under its existing credit facility . Verizon’ s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:
• requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and the preferred stock
issued by an entity acquired in a transaction with Vodafone, which would reduce the funds Verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital
expenditures and acquisitions;
• making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt
refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;
• reducing V erizon’ s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions;
• making V erizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and
• exposing V erizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates.
Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing.
We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets.
Adverse chan ges in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borro wing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our
operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies,
which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing
and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financi ng. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do
business, and such instability could also af fect our access to financing.
Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.
With approximately 155,400  employees and approximately 197,000 retirees as of December 31, 2017  eligibl e to participate in Verizon’ s benefit plans, the costs of pension
benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability . Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for
these plans, are affected by several factors, including  the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential repeal and replacement or modification of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds  held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the
discount rate and mortality  assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans,
those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.
A significant portion of our workforce is represente d by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of
our labor contracts.
As of December 31, 2017 , approximately 23% of our workf orce was represented by labor unions. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent
negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while less than 1% of the
workforce of our wireless and other businesses outsid e of wireline is represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this
workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations.
We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.
We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and
hour class actions, persona l injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal
injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in defending these
lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.

telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, of fice equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction and leasehold improvements.
Item 3.    Legal Proceedings
In Octo ber 2013, the California Attorney General’ s Office notified certain Verizon companies of potent ial violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily
arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilitie s. We are cooperating with this investigation and continue to review
our operations relating to the management of hazard ous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties
ultimately incurred will be material.

Stock Repur chases
On March 3, 2017, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a new share buyback program to repurchase  up to 100 million shares of the company's common stock. The new
program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches  100 million, or at the close of business on February 28, 2020, whichever is sooner . Under the
program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange
Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any , will depend on market conditions and the Company’ s capital allocation priorities.
During the years ended December 31, 2017  and 2016 , Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’ s common stock under our authorized share buyback programs. At
December 31, 2017, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of V erizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’ s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is
required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal control established
in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our chief
executive of ficer and chief financial of ficer have concluded that the registrant’ s disclosure controls and procedures were ef fective as of December 31, 2017 .
In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended
to ensure an effective internal control environment. There were no changes in the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2017  that
have materially af fected, or are reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.

EXHIBIT 10c(iv)
VERIZON COMMUNICA TIONS INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
2017 RESTRICTED ST OCK UNIT AGREEMENT
AGREEMENT between V erizon Communications Inc. (“V erizon” or the “Company”) and you (the “Participant”) and your heirs and beneficiaries.
1. Purpose of Agr eement. The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to the Participant.
2. Agreement. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to the 2017 V erizon Communications Inc. Long- T erm Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and evidences the grant of a
restricted stock unit award in the form of RSUs pursuant to the Plan. In consideration of the benefits described in this Agreement, which Participant acknowledges are good,
valuable and suf ficient consideration, the Participant agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions
set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement and the Participant’ s non-competition, non- solicitation, confidentiality and other obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibit B to
this Agreement, both of which are incorporated into and are a part of the Agreement. The RSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. By
executing this Agreement, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’ s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement. In addition, the Participant agrees to be bound by the actions of the Human Resources Committee
of Verizon’ s Board of Directors or any successor thereto (the “Committee”), and any designee of the Committee (to the extent that such actions are exercised in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement). If there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.
3. Contingency . The grant of RSUs is contingent on the Participant’ s timely acceptance of this Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions contained in it. Acceptance
shall be through execution of the Agreement as set forth in paragraph 21. If the Participant does not accept this Agreement by the close of business on January 5, 2018, the
Participant shall not be entitled to this grant of RSUs regardless of the extent to which the requirements in paragraph 5 (“V esting”) are satisfied. In addition, to the extent a
Participant is on a Company approved leave of absence, including but not limited to short-term disability leave, he or she will not be entitled to this grant of RSUs until such
time as he or she returns to active employment with V erizon or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) and accepts this Agreement within the time period established
by the Company .
4. Number of Units. The Participant is granted the number of RSUs as specified in the Participant’ s account under the 2017 RSU grant, administered by Fidelity Investments
or any successor thereto (“Fidelity”). A RSU is a hypothetical share of V erizon’ s common stock. The value of a RSU on any given date shall be equal to the closing price of
Verizon’ s common stock on the New Y ork Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) as of such date. A Dividend Equivalent Unit (“DEU”) or fraction thereof shall be added to each RSU
each time that a dividend is paid on V erizon’ s common stock. The amount of each DEU shall be equal to the corresponding dividend paid on a share of V erizon’ s common
stock. The DEU shall be converted into RSUs or fractions thereof based upon the closing price of V erizon’ s common stock traded on the NYSE on the dividend payment date
of each declared dividend on V erizon’ s common stock, and such RSUs or fractions thereof shall be added to the Participant’ s RSU balance. T o the extent that Fidelity or the
Company makes an error , including but not limited to an administrative error with respect to the number or value of the RSUs granted to the Participant under this Agreement,
the DEUs credited to the Participant’ s account or the amount of the final award payment, the Company or Fidelity specifically reserves the right to correct such error at any
time and the Participant agrees that he or she shall be legally bound by any corrective action taken by the Company or Fidelity .
5. Vesting.
(a) General. The Participant shall vest in the RSUs as follows: one-third of the total number of RSUs subject to this grant (including DEUs credited with respect to such
RSUs) shall vest on November 6, 2018, one-third of the total number of RSUs subject to this grant (including DEUs credited with respect to such RSUs) shall vest on
November 6, 2019, and the remaining number of RSUs subject to this grant (including DEUs credited with respect to such RSUs) shall vest on November 6, 2020. The
Participant must be continuously employed by the Company or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) from the date the RSUs are granted through each of the
applicable vesting dates specified in this paragraph 5(a) as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the RSUs, except as otherwise provided in paragraph
7 (“Early Cancellation/Accelerated V esting of RSUs”) or as otherwise provided by the Committee.
(b) Transfer . Transfer of employment from V erizon to a Related Company , from a Related Company to V erizon, or from one Related Company to another Related
Company shall not constitute a separation from employment hereunder , and service with a Related Company shall be treated as service with the Company for purposes of
the continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a).
6. Payment. All payments under this Agreement shall be made in cash. Subject to paragraph 7(a), as soon as practicable after the vesting date of the applicable installment of
the RSUs specified in Section 5(a) (but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the applicable vesting date), the value of shares that vested on the applicable vesting date
(minus any withholding for taxes) shall be paid to the Participant. The amount of cash that shall be paid (plus withholding for taxes) shall equal the number of RSUs that vested
on the applicable vesting date times the closing price of V erizon’ s common stock on the NYSE as of the applicable vesting date (or if the common stock is not traded on such

rights thereto. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the Committee or the Executive V ice President and Chief Administrative Of ficer of V erizon (or his or her

Company for purposes of this Agreement.
14. Employment Status. The grant of the RSUs shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment for a particular term between the Company or a Related Company

necessary to make the provision enforceable according to applicable law and shall be enforced as amended. The RSUs are intended not to be subject to any tax, interest or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with such intent.

Damages Disputes described in paragraph (a)(ii) below , regarding (A) the interpretation of the Plan or this Agreement, (B) any of the terms or conditions of the

Plan and this Agreement and to decide all Plan Disputes brought under this Plan and Agreement. Determinations made by the EB Committee shall be final, conclusive and
binding, subject only to review by arbitration pursuant to paragraph (c) below under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review . A Participant’ s failure to refer a Plan

pursuant to the aforesaid rules of the AAA no later than one year from the date that the claim accrues, except where a longer limitations period is required by applicable
law. However , a Participant’ s failure to initiate arbitration within one year will in no way impair the Company’ s right, exercised at its discretion, to compel arbitration or

4
limitations period contained herein shall be made by the arbitrator . A copy of the AAA ’s Commercial Arbitration Rules may be obtained from Human Resources. The

Company , unless the parties agree in writing to a dif ferent location. All claims by the Company or a Related Company against the Participant, except for breaches of any
of the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, may also be raised in such arbitration proceedings.
(i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether any dispute submitted for arbitration hereunder is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall decide all
issues submitted for arbitration according to the terms of the Plan, this Agreement (except for breaches of any of the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions
set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement), existing Company policy , and applicable substantive Delaware State and U.S. federal law and shall have the
authority to award any remedy or relief permitted by such laws. The final decision of the EB Committee with respect to a Plan Dispute shall be upheld unless
such decision was arbitrary or capricious. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive, not subject to appeal, and binding and enforceable in any
applicable court.
(ii) The Participant understands and agr ees that, pursuant to this Agr eement, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company waive
any right to sue each other in a court of law or equity , to have a trial by jury , or to r esolve disputes on a collective, or class, basis (except for br eaches
of any of the Participant’ s obligations and r estrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agr eement), and that the sole forum available for the
resolution of Units A ward Disputes and Units Damages Disputes is arbitration as pr ovided in this paragraph 25. If an arbitrator or court finds that
the arbitration pr ovisions of this Agr eement ar e not enfor ceable, both Participant and the Company or a Related Company understand and agr ee to
waive their right to trial by jury of any Units A ward Dispute or Units Damages Dispute. This dispute r esolution pr ocedur e shall not pr event either the
Participant or the Company or a Related Company fr om commencing an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining
injunctive r elief to pr event irr eparable harm pending and in aid of arbitration her eunder; in such event, both the Participant and the Company or a
Related Company agr ee that the party who commences the action may pr oceed without necessity of posting a bond.
(iii) In consideration of the Participant’ s agreement in paragraph (ii) above, the Company or a Related Company will pay all filing, administrative and
arbitrator ’s fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings. If the AAA requires the Participant to pay the initial filing fee, the Company or a
Related Company will reimburse the Participant for that fee. All other fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including but not limited to
each party’ s attorney’ s fees, will be the responsibility of such party .
(iv) The parties intend that the arbitration procedure to which they hereby agree shall be the exclusive means for resolving all Units A ward Disputes and Units
Damages Disputes (subject to the mandatory EB Committee procedure provided for in paragraph 25(b) above). Their agreement in this regard shall be
interpreted as broadly and inclusively as reason permits to realize that intent.
(v) The Federal Arbitration Act (“F AA”) shall govern the enforceability of this paragraph 25. If for any reason the F AA is held not to apply , or if application of
the F AA requires consideration of state law in any dispute arising under this Agreement or subject to this dispute resolution provision, the laws of the State of
Delaware shall apply without giving ef fect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
(vi) To the extent an arbitrator determines that the Participant was not terminated for Cause and is entitled to the RSUs or any other benefits under the Plan
pursuant to the provisions applicable to an involuntary termination without Cause, the Participant’ s obligation to execute a release satisfactory to V erizon as
provided under paragraph 7(c)(2) shall remain applicable in order to receive the benefit of any RSUs pursuant to this Agreement.
26. Additional Remedies. Notwithstanding the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, and in addition to any other rights or
remedies, whether legal, equitable, or otherwise, that each of the parties to this Agreement may have (including the right of the Company to terminate the Participant for Cause

this Agreement are not specifically enforced and that monetary damages will not adequately protect the Company and any Related Company from a breach of any of such
Participant obligations and restrictions;
5
(e) If any dispute arises concerning the violation or anticipated or threatened violation by the Participant of any of the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in
Exhibits A or B, an injunction may be issued restraining such violation pending the determination of such controversy , and no bond or other security shall be required in
connection therewith;
(f) The Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement shall continue to apply after any expiration, termination, or cancellation of
this Agreement;
(g) The Participant’ s breach of any of the Participant’ s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, including, for example, any breach of
the Participant’ s non- competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality restrictions, shall result in the Participant’ s immediate forfeiture of all rights and benefits, including
all RSUs and DEUs, under this Agreement; and

and any damages (including but not limited to damages resulting in the forfeiture of an award or benefits under this Agreement) that may result from the breach of such
Participant obligations and restrictions shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, but shall instead

shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New Jersey without giving ef fect to that jurisdiction’ s choice of law rules; and (c)
the parties consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of New Jersey , and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the
State of New Jersey , over any action, claim, controversy or proceeding arising under this Exhibit B, and irrevocably waive any objection they may now or hereafter have to the

VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
Introduction
The Verizon Executive Deferral Plan (the “Plan” or “EDP”) provides an easy way for you to set aside for the future a portion of your annual base salary, as
well as all or a portion of your short-term incentive award in order to defer current Federal, State and Local income taxes (where applicable) and to receive
valuable matching credits and profit sharing credits from Verizon Communications Inc. and its participating subsidiaries (the “Company”). It reaches beyond
the limits of a traditional 401(k) plan to provide additional wealth accumulation opportunity. For non-employee directors, it allows for the deferral of your
annual cash retainer and associated meeting fees and equity compensation.
•The EDP allows you to defer a portion of your annual base salary and short-term incentive award or non-employee director annual retainer and
associated meeting fees; and
•The EDP also allows you to receive a Company match on the amounts you defer up to 6% of your eligible base salary and short-term incentive award,
without any limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. However, non-employee members of the board of directors are not eligible for a
Company match.
References to “short-term incentive award” in the Plan include short term incentive awards paid by Verizon under the Verizon Short-Term Incentive Plan and
annual cash bonuses paid by Oath Inc. and its participating subsidiaries (“Oath”) under the applicable Oath annual bonus program.
For years prior to 2018, certain long-term incentive awards could be deferred under the Plan by certain Eligible Participants (those deferrals were not eligible
for Company match). Deferrals from long-term incentive awards are no longer permitted after 2017. Long-term incentive awards deferred prior to 2018
remain subject to the terms of the award and the applicable deferral election.
Because the EDP is an account-based plan, your benefit will equal the balance in a bookkeeping account kept for you under the Plan. In addition, the EDP
offers a broad variety of hypothetical investment options and your account balance will increase or decrease depending on the performance of the investment
options you choose. Therefore, you should exercise care when choosing among the hypothetical investment options available under the EDP.
The savings opportunities offered by the EDP allow you to set aside more money for your future than you could if you were able to make deferrals only under
the Verizon Savings Plan for Management Employees (the “Savings Plan”).
Effective as of April 11, 2014, the Verizon Wireless Executive Deferral Plan (the “Wireless EDP”) was merged into the EDP. The terms of the EDP now
govern amounts that were previously deferred under the Wireless EDP.
Effective as of January 1, 2018, employees of Oath (including employees of the former Yahoo business) who are Eligible Participants may participate in the
Plan by making deferral elections during the annual enrollment period for 2018. Eligible Participants of the former AOL business became eligible to
participate in the Plan effective January 1, 2016.
The Plan succeeds the Verizon Income Deferral Plan (the “IDP”), the Verizon Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “Directors’
Plan”), and the Verizon Wireless Executive Savings Plan (the “ESP”) which were frozen as of December 31, 2004. If you were a participant in the IDP, the
Directors’ Plan or the ESP, vested amounts in your account in those plans as of December 31, 2004, remain in those plans and are subject to the rules that
govern those plans. However, in order to comply with changes in the law that were effective January 1,
January 2018        Page 3
•VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
2005, amounts credited to your IDP account that were not vested as of December 31, 2004, were transferred to the EDP and are now subject to the rules that
govern EDP accounts generally.
This booklet sets forth the terms of the EDP, as they are in effect on the date of this booklet. If you have any questions about your EDP benefits, please
contact the Total Rewards department at 1-888-560-3669.
Plan Highlights
Natur e of Plan and Benefit Your Plan benefit is based on an account balance and will equal the vested value of that account balance when you receive payments from
the Plan. The value of your account balance will increase or decrease based upon the performance of the hypothetical investment options
you elect. The Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified benefit plan.
Deferrals for Active Participants You can defer up to 100% of the portion of your base salary that exceeds the limit that the Internal Revenue Code imposes on
funded, tax-qualified plans ($275,000 in 2018) (your “eligible base salary”).
•    You can defer up to 100% of your short-term incentive award or directors’ cash retainer and associated meeting fees (“directors’
fees”).Generally , deferral elections for your eligible base salary , short-term incentive award (or annual cash bonus), and directors’
fees for a year must be submitted during an enrollment period in November or December of the preceding year and cannot be
changed after December 31 of that preceding year (or the last business day in December if earlier than the 31st).
•    If you were not eligible to participate in the EDP and are promoted or hired into an eligible position, you will generally be provided a
30-day window in which to submit your salary and/or incentive deferral elections, if appropriate. A similar rule applies to newly-
appointed non-employee members of the board of directors.
Company Match and Pr ofit
Sharing•    The Company will add a “Matching Credit” to your account if you defer eligible base salary and short-term incentive under the Plan
and if, in the case of deferrals of short-term incentive, you are employed by the Company on the date the short-term incentive
awards for the applicable year are paid to employees generally .
•    You will receive a matching credit of $1.00 for every $1.00 of the first 6% of your eligible base salary and short-term incentive
that you defer .
•    Matching Credits for base salary deferrals are made with each applicable pay period. Matching Credits for short-term incentive
deferrals are credited to your account on the date that short-term incentive awards for the applicable year are paid to employees
generally .
•    The Company may , in its sole discretion, decide to make a Profit Sharing contribution (“Profit Sharing Credit”) to your EDP account
if you would be eligible for such a contribution under the Savings Plan.
•    All Matching Credits and Profit Sharing Credits are allocated to the V erizon Stock Fund, a hypothetical unitized investment option in
which the values of units of the V erizon Stock Fund are based primarily on the price of V erizon common stock, but a small portion is
invested in cash or cash equivalents and other short-term investments.
•    No Matching Credits will be allocated to the Profit Sharing Credits.
•    Non-employee members of the board of directors are not eligible for any Company Matching Credits or Profit Sharing Credits.
January 2018        Page 4
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
Account Options•    You can generally elect to have your Personal Deferral Credits treated as if they were invested in any of the hypothetical investment
options that mirror the performance of the Savings Plan investment options or in a hypothetical option that provides a return that
mirrors the yield on certain corporate bonds.
•    Company Matching Credits and Profit Sharing Credits are invested in the hypothetical V erizon Stock Fund and you may elect to
diversify those amounts into other available hypothetical investment options only after certain requirements are satisfied.
Distributions fr om the Plan of
Your Personal Deferrals•    At the time you make your deferral election, you must also elect when and how you would like to have your benefit distributed. Y ou
may elect one of the following distribution forms:
–    One lump sum payment; or
–    Annual installments (between 2 and 20 years).
•    Distributions can generally begin at separation from service (subject to a six-month delay for specified employees) or on a specified
date either before or after your separation from service. Special rules apply to long-term incentive awards that were deferred prior to
2018 and that are paid after the year you separate from service.
•    If you elect to receive a lump sum or to begin receiving installments on a specified date, the earliest you can receive a distribution is 2
full years following the year in which the amount that you elected to defer is credited to your account.
•    If you elect to receive a lump sum or to begin receiving installments at separation from service, your distribution election is
irrevocable.
•    If you elect to receive a distribution based on a specific date, you can change your distribution elections provided that (1) you make
the election change at least 12 months prior to the originally scheduled distribution date, (2) you delay the date you would have
otherwise received each distribution by at least 5 years, and (3) you do not receive your distribution sooner or over a shorter period
of time.
Distributions fr om the Plan of
Company Matching Cr edits and
Profit Sharing Cr edits•    All Company Matching Credits and Profit Sharing Credits in your EDP account will be distributed in a lump sum payment following
your separation from service (or six months after your separation from service if you are a specified employee).
Vesting•    Your personal deferrals under the Plan are vested immediately .
•    Your Company Matching Credits and Profit Sharing Credits vest at the same time you vest in the employer contributions under the
Savings Plan.
•    Your Company Matching Credits and Profit Sharing Credits will also vest if (1) your employment is involuntarily terminated without
cause, (2) you become disabled, (3) you die, or (4) there is a change in control of V erizon Communications Inc.
•    Any other Company credits transferred to the EDP from another plan (including Retirement Credits transferred from the IDP) will
vest according to the vesting schedule in place under the other plan at the time of the transfer . Because the W ireless EDP was
merged into the EDP , any Company credits originally credited under the W ireless EDP will vest according to the vesting schedule in
place under the EDP (which is the same schedule as under the W ireless EDP).
* This T able is a brief summary of the terms of the EDP , which are set forth in the remainder of this booklet.
January 2018        Page 5
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
Participating in the Plan
You can participate in the Plan on either an “active” or an “inactive” basis. The principal difference between the two is that, as an “active”
participant, you can make deferrals into your EDP account and you are eligible to receive Matching Credits and Profit Sharing Credits. As
either an “active” or “inactive” participant, you can invest your EDP account in the hypothetical investment options available under the Plan
and elect when you will receive distributions of the balance in your Plan account.
ACTIVE PARTICIPATION
You are an “Eligible Participant” for purposes of the Plan if you are a U.S.-based (domestic) director level employee or above at Verizon or
Verizon Wireless; or, effective January 1, 2018, a domestic VP level or above employee at Oath (“Eligible Participant”). If you are a domestic
director level employee at Verizon or Verizon Wireless and you transfer to Oath you will remain an “Eligible Participant” for purposes of the
Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Company. If you were an Eligible Participant of Verizon or Verizon Wireless or a non-employee
member of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) on January 1, 2005, you automatically became an active participant in the Plan on
that date if you were deferring compensation at that time. If you were not an Eligible Participant on January 1, 2005 and were hired or
promoted to an Eligible Participant position or became an Eligible Participant or a non-employee member of the Company’s Board of Directors
after January 1, 2005, you will automatically become an active participant in the Plan on the date you become an Eligible Participant or a non-
employee member of the Board. Once you become an active participant, you will remain an active participant eligible for the Plan provisions
applicable to Eligible Participants for as long as you are an Eligible Participant or a non-employee member of the Board.
INACTIVE PARTICIPATION
You will become an inactive participant if your employment with the Company ends, if you are demoted below the status of director or VP (as
applicable) or any equivalent level, if you cease to be a non-employee member of the Board or a domestic employee or if you die. Once you
become an inactive participant, you will remain an inactive participant as long as you have a positive balance in your EDP account or until you
become an active participant again.
Your Account Balance
YOUR BEGINNING BALANCE
Depending on the circumstances under which you became an active participant, you might have a beginning balance in your EDP account.
Effective as of April 11, 2014, the Verizon Wireless Executive Deferral Plan (“Wireless EDP”) was merged into the EDP. The terms of the EDP
now govern amounts that were previously deferred under the Wireless EDP.
January 2018        Page 6
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
If you participated in the Verizon Income Deferral Plan (“IDP”), the Verizon Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors
(“Directors’ Plan”) prior to January 1, 2005, any unvested benefit under those plans was transferred to the EDP and credited to your EDP
account as a beginning balance. (As noted in “Effect on Other Benefit Plans” beginning on page 17, you will no longer be eligible under the
transferor plan for a benefit based on the amounts transferred to the EDP.) Any amounts that were transferred from another plan to the
beginning balance in your EDP account will be characterized as “Personal Deferral Credits,” “Company Matching Credits,” or “Retirement
Credits” (as defined below) by the Plan administrator depending on the nature of those credits under the plan from which the amounts were
transferred.
Amounts transferred to the Plan may be subject to various restrictions in addition to those described here. The Plan administrator will advise
you if any such restrictions apply to any part of your EDP account.
ADDING TO YOUR BALANCE
The balance in your EDP account can increase while you are an active participant through your deferral of compensation into your EDP
account and through Company Matching Credits and Profit Sharing Credits that are added to your EDP account. As previously noted, the value
of your account may also increase or decrease due to the performance of the hypothetical investments to which your account balances are
allocated.
Your Deferral of Compensation
Personal Deferral Credits
The Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of your pay that can be treated as “compensation” under the Company’s “qualified” savings plan
and “qualified” pension plan. This limit (also referred to as the Code Section 401(a) (17) limit) in 2018 is $275,000 and is subject to adjustment
in future years. Any base salary you earn over this limit (as adjusted) is referred to under the Plan as “eligible base salary.” For purposes of the
Plan, “base salary” means the annual base rate of cash compensation payable by the Company to an Eligible Participant during a calendar year,
excluding incentive compensation, bonuses, special/overtime pay bonuses, severance payments, and other irregular compensation and
payments.
As an active participant, you can elect to defer receipt of all or part of your eligible base salary if you are an Eligible Participant, or your annual
retainer and associated meeting fees (“directors’ fees”) if you are a non-employee member of the Board, into your EDP account. In addition, if
you are an Eligible Participant, you may defer all or part of your short-term incentive into your EDP account. For purposes of the Plan, “short-
term incentives” include short term incentive awards paid by Verizon under the Verizon Short-Term Incentive Plan and annual cash bonuses
paid by Oath under the applicable Oath annual bonus program, but do not include any payment that is made in connection with your separation
from service prior to the date that the short-term incentive awards for the year are payable to employees generally.
If you elect to defer compensation under the Plan, you waive your right to receive the amount deferred at the time it would otherwise be paid
and agree instead to receive the deferred amount under the terms of the Plan.
January 2018        Page 7
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
Your deferrals of eligible base salary, short-term incentive, long-term incentives deferred prior to 2018, and/or directors’ fees are your
“Personal Deferral Credits” under the EDP and the portion of your EDP account balance attributable to your Personal Deferral Credits, as
adjusted to reflect investment performance, is your “Employee Balance” under the Plan.
Election to Defer Compensation
If you want to elect to defer all or part of your eligible base salary, short-term incentive, directors’ fees, or other eligible compensation, your
election must be made in accordance with the terms of the Plan and any terms and conditions the Plan administrator may impose.
Eligible Base Salary and Directors’ Fees. To defer all or a part of your eligible base salary or directors’ fees, you must submit your election to
the Plan administrator during the annual enrollment period. The annual enrollment period occurs before the first day of the calendar year to
which the election applies (generally in November/December of the year prior to the year in which the salary or fee is earned).
Your election will apply only to eligible base salary or directors’ fees earned in the year after the year in which you make the election and your
election will not be renewed automatically for the following year. For example, your election during the 2017 enrollment period will apply only
to eligible base salary or directors’ fees earned in 2018. In addition, you cannot change or revoke your election after December 31st (or after the
last business day of December, if earlier than the 31st) of the year in which you make the election.
Short-Term Incentive Awards. To defer all or part of your short-term incentive, you must submit your election to the Plan administrator
during the annual enrollment period. The annual enrollment period occurs before the first day of the calendar year to which the election applies
(generally in November/December of the year prior to the year in which the award is earned).
Your election will apply only to any short-term incentive award for the year for which the election applies and your election will not be
automatically renewed and will not apply to any award earned in any other year. For example, your election during the 2017 enrollment period
will apply only to your short-term incentive earned in 2018 (and payable in 2019). In addition, you cannot change or revoke your election after
December 31st (or after the last business day of December, if earlier than the 31st) of the year in which you make the election.
For purposes of the Plan, “short-term incentives” do not include any payment that is made in connection with your separation from service
prior to the date that the short-term incentive awards for the year are payable to employees generally. In addition, if you receive a short-term
incentive award on the date that the short-term incentive awards for the year are payable to employees generally, but have previously separated
from service, your short-term incentive deferral election will remain in effect, however, as noted on page 10, you will not receive a Matching
Credit on your deferred award.
Long-Term Incentive Awards. Deferrals from long-term incentive awards are no longer permitted for awards granted after 2017. Long-term
incentive awards deferred prior to 2018 (deferred during the 2016
January 2018        Page 8
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
or any prior annual enrollment period) remain subject to the terms of the award and the applicable deferral election.
Newly Eligible Participants. If you are not eligible to participate in the EDP and are promoted or hired into an eligible position, you will be
provided a 30-day window beginning on the date you become an Eligible Participant to make a deferral election with respect to eligible base
salary earned after you make your election. During this 30-day period, you may also be permitted to make a deferral election with respect to
any short-term incentive award earned during the year in which you become an Eligible Participant, but your election will apply only to a pro-
rated portion of the award (based on the performance period remaining at the time of your election relative to the total performance period).
You will be treated just like all other participants for each subsequent year.
A newly eligible employee who does not submit a deferral election within 30 days of the effective date of hire or promotion will be considered
to have elected not to defer any salary or incentive compensation for the year in which he or she was hired or promoted. This is true with
respect to incentive awards even if you are hired or promoted before the applicable enrollment period. If you were previously eligible to
participate in the EDP or in another deferred compensation plan of a Company affiliate that is required to be aggregated with the EDP under
section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 409A”) and you subsequently become eligible to participate in the EDP, special rules
apply to determine whether you are considered to be newly eligible for the EDP. These rules will be applied in accordance with Section 409A
and Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-2(a) (7). For example, this special rule could apply if you were eligible to participate in the EDP (or
Wireless EDP) when your employment with the Company terminated and you are rehired 24 months after your employment terminated.
If you were eligible to participate in the Wireless EDP before it was merged into the EDP, or if you become an Eligible Participant after
transferring from a Company affiliate for which you were already eligible to defer any compensation under a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan of the Company affiliate that is merged into the Plan, the initial eligibility rules described above will not apply to you.
Instead, the deferral elections (or non-elections) you made with the Company affiliate under the Company affiliate’s plan (including the
Wireless EDP) will carry over. Those elections will continue to apply to your eligible compensation for the year in which you become an
Eligible Participant (including, to the extent applicable, bonuses and awards based in whole or in part on service for that year). You will be
treated just like all other Eligible Participants for subsequent deferral elections.
Duration and Cancellation of Deferral Elections. A deferral election shall remain in effect only for the year or performance period to which
it relates. The Company may, in its sole discretion, cancel a deferral election after it has become irrevocable for a deferral year only in the case
of the "disability" or "unforeseeable emergency" of the Eligible Participant or to comply with the requirements for receiving a hardship
distribution from a qualified plan maintained by the Company. These rules will be applied in accordance with Section 409A and Treasury
Regulation sections 1.409A-3(j)(4)(xii) and (viii).

VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
Company Provided Credits
Matching Credits
If you elect to defer all or part of your eligible base salary and/or short-term incentive, you may receive additional credits in your EDP account.
These credits are known under the Plan as “Matching Credits.” Matching Credits for base salary deferrals are credited to your EDP account
with each applicable pay period. Matching Credits for short-term incentive deferrals are credited to your EDP account on the date that short-
term incentive awards for the applicable year are paid to employees generally. To receive Matching Credits on deferrals from your short-term
incentive, you must be employed by the Company on the date that short-term incentive awards for the applicable year are paid to employees
generally. The balance of your EDP account attributable to Matching Credits, together with any Profit Sharing Credits described below,
including any investment earnings (or minus any investment losses) on these credits, are referred to as your “Employer Balance.” Non-
employee Directors are not eligible for Matching Credits.
For each Plan year, your Matching Credits will be determined as follows:
The Company will add a “Matching Credit” to your account if you defer eligible base salary and/or short-term incentive under the Plan and if, in the case of
deferrals from the short-term incentive, you are employed by the Company on the date the short-term incentive awards for the applicable year are paid to
employees generally. You will automatically receive $1.00 for every $1.00 of the first 6% of your eligible base salary and short-term incentive that you defer.
EXAMPLE - You have $50,000 in eligible base salary and receive a $100,000 short-term incentive in 2018. You defer 100% of your eligible base salary and
75% of your short-term incentive into your EDP account. You remain an employee of the Company through the date the short-term incentive is paid (in
February of 2018). For the year, you will have $134,000 credited to your EDP account (before crediting earnings and losses), calculated as follows:
Personal Deferral Credits: $125,000 (100% of $50,000 plus 75% of $100,000); and
Matching Credits: $9,000 (Because you have deferred 6% of your total eligible base salary plus short-term incentive into your EDP account).
Profit Sharing Credits
The Company may, in its sole discretion, make a Profit Sharing contribution to your EDP account if you are eligible for a profit sharing
contribution under the Savings Plan.
If the Company decides to make a Profit Sharing contribution for a plan year, your EDP account will be credited with an amount, if any, equal
to the Profit Sharing contribution you would have received under the Savings Plan, if not for the limits imposed by the IRS, less any Profit
Sharing contributions you actually received under the Savings Plan. The Profit Sharing contribution, if any, would be made to your EDP
account at the same time that the Profit Sharing contribution is made to your account under the Savings Plan.

VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
INVESTING YOUR ACCOUNT
Investment Options
You will be able to allocate your EDP account among the Plan’s hypothetical investment options as long as you are either an active or an
inactive participant in the Plan. The hypothetical investment options available under the Plan generally mirror those available under the Savings
Plan and are subject to any restrictions imposed by the Savings Plan. In addition, you can allocate your EDP account to a hypothetical
“Moody’s” investment fund that provides a return that mirrors the yield on certain long-term, high-grade corporate bonds.
Allocating Your Account Balance Among the Investment Options
When you first become a participant in the Plan, your initial EDP account balance (if you have one as discussed under “Your Beginning
Balance” on page 6) will be allocated in the same manner the credits were allocated in the IDP or the Directors’ Plan. Similarly, if you were
eligible to participate in the Wireless EDP before it was merged into the EDP, your Wireless EDP account balance allocations will continue to
apply. Thereafter, you may elect (or change an existing election) at any time to allocate all or any part of your existing or new base salary
and/or short-term incentive Personal Deferral Credits to any of the hypothetical investment options available under the Plan. Any long-term
incentive award Personal Deferral Credits attributable to awards granted before 2018 (which include those attributable to both Performance
Stock Units (PSUs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)) will initially be deposited into the hypothetical “Moody’s” investment fund, and you
will be eligible to transfer those amounts to any of the other hypothetical investment funds available under the Plan at any time thereafter.
However, as noted above and under “Your Beginning Balance” on page 6, special rules apply with respect to certain restricted amounts in your
EDP account. If you do not make an investment election with respect to Personal Deferral Credits, those credits will be invested in the
hypothetical “Moody’s” investment fund until you make a valid investment option election.
All of your Company Matching and Profit Sharing Credits will be allocated to the hypothetical Verizon Stock Fund, in which the values of units
of the Verizon Stock Fund are based primarily on the price of Verizon common stock, but a small portion is invested in cash or cash equivalents
and other short-term investments.
If you have at least one year of service with the Company, you may qualify for the following diversification rule associated with the Matching
and Profit Sharing Credits: beginning at age 50 you may elect to transfer up to 100% of your Matching and Profit Sharing Credits out of the
Verizon Stock Fund to any of the other hypothetical investment funds offered under the Plan.
Exchange Restrictions on Funds
The exchange restrictions that apply to the hypothetical investment funds in the EDP are the same as the exchange restrictions provided for in
the Savings Plan.

Distributions fr om the Plan
MAKING AN ELECTION
At the time that you elect to defer your eligible base salary, short-term incentive award, or directors’ fees, as applicable, you must also elect
how and when you would like these deferred amounts to be paid – this is called class year accounting. These rules also apply to deferrals from
eligible long-term incentive awards granted prior to 2018.
How You Receive Your Payment. You may elect one of the following distribution forms with respect to each class year of deferrals:
•    One lump sum payment;
•    Annual installments (between 2 and 20 years).
If you elect to receive annual installments, the amount of each installment payment will be equal to a fraction of your account balance on the
evaluation date (as determined by the Plan administrator) immediately preceding the date of distribution, the numerator of which is one and the
denominator of which is the number of installment payments remaining (including the installment payment in question). The final installment
will be the remaining balance in your account. For example, if you choose to have your deferral of eligible base salary for 2018 distributed in
three annual installments beginning in 2022, the installments will be paid as follows:
• 2022: ⅓ of your account balance associated with the 2018 base salary deferral
•2023: ½ of your remaining account balance associated with the 2018 base salary deferral
• 2024: The remainder of your account associated with the 2018 base salary deferral.
When You Receive Payment. You can elect to receive your benefit
•At your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A (subject to a six-month delay if you are a specified
employee) or
•    On a specified date.
If you elect to receive your distribution upon your separation from service, the lump sum payment or first annual installment, as applicable, will
be paid within 60 days following separation from service, unless you are a specified employee on the date of your separation from service. If
you are a specified employee, the lump sum payment (or first annual installment, as applicable) will be paid on the date that is six months from
the date of your separation from service.
January 2018        Page 12
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
A special rule applies to deferrals of eligible long-term incentive awards granted prior to 2018 by Eligible Participants who were eligible to
defer such awards. For those deferrals, an election to receive your benefit upon separation from service (including a default election under the
rules described below) is considered an election to receive the lump sum payment (or first annual installment, as applicable) in the year
immediately following the end of the long-term incentive award cycle if you separate from service in an earlier year. For example, if you
elected to defer your long-term incentive award granted in 2016 until separation from service and then retire in 2017, your deferral election will
remain in effect, and the deferred award, to the extent vested, will be paid in 2019, after the end of the three-year award cycle. A payment made
in the year following the end of the award cycle (when that year is later than the year you separate from service) is considered to be made on a
specified date and is not subject to the six-month wait for specified employees. However, you cannot elect to subsequently change such a
deferral election under the “Changing an Election” rules described below.
If you elect to receive a distribution based on a specified date, you may not elect a distribution date that is earlier than 2 full years following the
year the deferral was credited to your account. For example, if you elect to defer 75% of your short-term incentive for 2018 (paid in 2019) into
your EDP account, the earliest date you may specify to receive the 2018 short-term incentive class year deferral is January 1, 2022.
If you elect to receive annual installments based on a specified date, the date you specify will be the date when the first installment is paid.
If you elect annual installments, each subsequent installment will be paid on the anniversary of the first installment payment.
CHANGING AN ELECTION
If you elect to receive a distribution based on a specified date, you can subsequently elect to change your prior election with respect to a class
year of deferrals, provided that (1) you make the change at least 12 months prior to the originally scheduled distribution date (the date of the
first payment in the case of installments), (2) you delay the date you would have otherwise received each distribution by at least 5 years, and (3)
you do not elect to receive your distribution sooner or over a shorter period of time than was specified by your prior election.
If you have elected to receive a distribution as of a specific date, you cannot change that election to receive payment at separation from service.
In addition, you may not subsequently change the time or form of payment of an amount that you designate to have paid to you on your
separation from service. Please keep these rules in mind when you are making your initial elections.
January 2018        Page 13
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
EXAMPLE - You have elected to receive your eligible base salary deferred in 2018 in two annual installments beginning on January 1, 2021.
On December 1, 2020, you submit a new election to receive your eligible base salary deferred in 2018 in a lump sum on January 1, 2022.
Because you did not submit this new election at least 12 months prior to the date the distributions were scheduled to begin and because you
have attempted to change from installments to a lump sum, your new election is invalid, and you will receive your first installment in January
2021. You will receive your second installment in January 2022 because you cannot change your distribution election once your benefit is in
pay status and because you cannot change from installments to a lump sum.
If you attempt to modify your election and all or any part of your new election is invalid, any valid election in effect immediately before you
submitted the modification will continue to remain in effect. If there is no valid election in effect, the default rules discussed below under
“Default Form and Timing of Payments” will apply.
DEFAULT FORM AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS
If you do not make a valid election to receive payments of all or any part of your vested EDP account, you will receive payments of your vested
EDP account balance (or the part of your EDP account for which no valid election has been made) in a lump sum within 60 days after the date
on which you separate from service with the Company (or on the date that is six months after the date you separate from service if you are a
specified employee).
PAYMENT OF COMPANY MATCHING AND PROFIT SHARING CREDITS
All vested Company Matching and Profit Sharing Credits will be distributed in a lump sum within 60 days after the date you separate from
service (or six months after the date you separate from service if you are a specified employee). You may not change the payment schedule of
these deferrals and you may not elect to receive them on a specified date.
SPECIAL RULES
Twenty-Year Limit on Initial Payment Dates
Your vested Plan benefits must begin to be paid no later than 20 years after your employment with the Company (and its affiliates) ends. This
could affect your benefit payments in the following ways:
•If you elect to receive all or part of your Plan benefit in a single lump sum on a specific date and the date you elect is more than 20
years after the date your employment with the Company (and its affiliates) ends, you will be deemed to have elected to receive the
lump sum 20 years from the date your employment ends;
•If you elect to receive all or part of your Plan benefit in annual installments and the date you elect to commence installments is
more than 20 years after the date your employment with the Company (and its affiliates) ends, you will be deemed to have elected
to commence installments 20 years from the date your employment ends.
January 2018        Page 14
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
Special Rule for Distributions Upon Separation From Service
If you elect to commence payments upon separation from service (or are subject to the default rule regarding the form and timing of payments)
and you separate from service during the first 12 months after you submit your election, you will receive a lump sum distribution (or the first
annual installment, as applicable) on the later of (1) the date such distribution or installment would be paid under the rules described above and
(2) the date that is 12 months from the date your submit your election.
Any payment that is to be made on account of your separation from service cannot be made until you separate from service with the Company
and its affiliates. If you transfer from the Company to an affiliate, you will generally not be considered to have separated from service.
Specified Employees
The Plan administrator will determine whether you are a specified employee for purposes of the EDP.
Special Rules that Apply at Disability
If you become disabled before your employment with the Company (or an affiliate) ends, you will receive your Plan benefit according to the
terms of any valid election made in accordance with the general terms of the Plan then in effect or, if applicable, under the rules discussed in
“Default Form and Timing of Payments” on page 14.
If you become disabled after your employment with the Company (or an affiliate) ends, you may change your election regarding the form and
timing of your Plan payments only in accordance with the otherwise applicable terms of the Plan and Section 409A.
Special Rules that Apply at Death
At time of death, your beneficiary will receive a lump sum payout of any unpaid portion 
of your account within 60 days after the supporting documentation is received by the Plan administrator.
Your beneficiary or beneficiaries will not be permitted to name their own beneficiaries 
or to change the form or timing of the benefit payments that they will receive.
Hardship Payments
You may at any time request payment of all or part of your Personal Deferral Credits 
if you can demonstrate to the Plan administrator that you have incurred unusual, extraordinary expenses as the result of hardship. The
maximum amount that you can withdraw under these circumstances is the amount necessary to relieve the hardship or financial emergency on
which the request is based, which may include amounts necessary to pay any Federal, State, local, or foreign income taxes or penalties
reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution.
January 2018        Page 15
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
The Plan administrator is required by law to impose significant limitations on the circumstances that qualify as a hardship or financial
emergency under the Plan. Generally speaking, to qualify for a distribution of your Personal Deferral Credits, you must demonstrate to the Plan
administrator that you have incurred a severe financial hardship resulting from an illness or accident of you, your spouse, beneficiary, or
dependent; loss of your property due to casualty (including the need to rebuild a home following damage to a home not otherwise covered by
insurance, for example, not as a result of a natural disaster); or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of
events beyond the control of the service provider.
The Plan administrator will determine in its sole discretion whether you are eligible to receive a distribution, and the amount you are eligible to
withdraw. A distribution may not be made to the extent that the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from
insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the your assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial hardship,
or by cessation of deferrals under the plan, and the hardship must constitute an “unforeseeable emergency” as determined under section
409A(a)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Vesting and Other Issues
VESTING
“Vesting” refers to your right to the balance in all or part of your EDP account.
Your Employee Balance
You are always 100% vested in your Personal Deferral Credits, unless you and the Company have a written agreement providing that part of
your Personal Deferral Credits will vest on a different schedule.
Your Employer Balance
You will be fully vested in your Company Matching and Profit Sharing Credits upon the earliest to occur of the following:
Your account in the Savings Plan becomes fully vested, which usually occurs after three years of service with the Company (or an affiliate);
Your employment with the Company or its affiliates is involuntarily terminated without cause;
You become disabled or die while employed with the Company or its affiliates; or
There is a change in control of Verizon Communications Inc., as determined by the Plan administrator under the terms of the Plan while you are
employed by the Company and its affiliates.
You will vest in any employer credits transferred to the EDP under the terms of the plan from which those amounts were transferred (although
you will vest in any employer credits under the Wireless EDP in accordance with the EDP terms described above). Note: If you are retirement
eligible or become
January 2018        Page 16
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
retirement eligible under the terms of the Verizon Management Pension Plan, all Retirement Credits will be fully vested on such date.
FORFEITURE
You can never forfeit your Personal Deferral Credits or your vested Company Matching and Profit Sharing Credits. However, if you resign
from the Company and its affiliates or if you are terminated for cause, you will forfeit any unvested credits in your account. Notwithstanding
anything in this Plan to the contrary, and to the extent permitted by governing law, the Plan administrator may offset amounts contained in your
account in order to satisfy any unpaid obligation or debt you have to the Company or to satisfy any liabilities that occur with respect to the
Company’s restatement of financial results based upon your willful misconduct or gross negligence.
Miscellaneous Matters
PLAN ADMINISTRATION
The Plan administrator is the most senior Human Resources officer of the Company, which will generally be the Executive Vice President and
Chief Administrative Officer of the Company. However, if you are an “insider” for purposes of certain securities laws, the Plan administrator is
the Human Resources Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. The Plan administrator has full discretionary authority and
responsibility to administer and interpret the Plan, and has the discretion to charge participants for reasonable Plan administration expenses. All
decisions of the Plan administrator are final and controlling for purposes of the Plan.
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
The Company intends to operate the Plan indefinitely. However, the Company has the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time as long
as (except with respect to certain changes in the law) no amendment or termination adversely affects the present dollar value of the vested
balance in your EDP account at the time the amendment is adopted or the Plan is terminated. In addition, for five years following a change in
control of Verizon Communications Inc., no amendment may adversely affect your rights under the Plan other than your right to future
Matching Credits or Profit Sharing Credits.
EFFECT ON OTHER BENEFIT PLANS
By participating in the Plan, you agree that the Plan will provide all of your Company-sponsored non-qualified deferred compensation benefits
earned or vested since January 1, 2005. You are no longer eligible to make personal contributions or receive company contributions under the
IDP, the Directors’ Plan, or the Verizon Wireless Executive Savings Plan (“ESP”).
However, amounts you deferred into the IDP, Directors’ Plan, or ESP that were vested on or before December 31, 2004, and were not
transferred to the EDP will remain in those plans and are subject to the applicable provisions of those plans as they may be amended from time
to time. Amounts you deferred
January 2018        Page 17
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
into the IDP or Directors’ Plan that were not vested on or before December 31, 2004 and that were transferred to the EDP as of January 1,
2005, will be subject to the terms of the EDP and not subject to the terms of the IDP or Directors’ Plan after December 31, 2004.
If you cease to be an Eligible Participant during a calendar year, your deferral elections for that year (if any) will apply for the remainder of that
year to (1) your eligible base salary and (2) any short-term incentive awards for which you become eligible upon ceasing to be an Eligible
Participant and which the Plan administrator determines must be subject to your deferral election in order to comply with Section 409A.
PLAN ACCOUNTS AND HYPOTHETICAL INVESTMENTS
Your EDP account is a bookkeeping account. That is, your Employee Balance and your Employer Balance are maintained for bookkeeping
purposes only. The Plan does not have any funds or assets.
Similarly, the investments referred to in the Plan are hypothetical in nature. Because your EDP account is only hypothetical, the Plan
administrator will not necessarily make any actual investments in accordance with the Plan or your instructions. Nonetheless, the Plan
administrator will track the performance of the investments that correspond to the hypothetical investments in your EDP account, and the value
of your EDP account will be adjusted to reflect the gains (and losses) of the investments corresponding to the hypothetical investments in your
account.
NO PLAN ASSETS OR TRUST
Unlike the Savings Plan and the Verizon Management Pension Plan, the EDP is not funded and has no trust or assets to secure your benefits. (If
the EDP were funded by a trust, you would be subject to immediate income tax on your vested Plan benefits, even though you would not
receive your vested Plan benefits until some future date— possibly many years in the future.) Consequently, in the event that the Company
becomes bankrupt, you will only be a general, unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the balance in your EDP account, and you
may not receive all of your EDP benefits.
ASSIGNMENT AND ALIENATION
In general, your rights under the Plan may not be assigned or pledged. However, the Plan will recognize and abide by the terms of certain
domestic relations orders. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, and to the extent permitted by governing law, the
Plan administrator may offset amounts contained in your account in order to satisfy any unpaid obligation or debt you have to the Company or
to satisfy any liabilities that occur with respect to the Company’s restatement of financial results based upon your willful misconduct or gross
negligence.
January 2018        Page 18
VERIZON EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL PLAN
WITHHOLDING AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES
Your employer has full authority to withhold any taxes (including employment taxes) applicable to amounts deferred from your compensation,
credits made to your EDP account, or payments of your Plan benefit. All personal deferrals and Matching Credits and Profit Sharing Credits to
the EDP are subject to FICA taxes (Medicare and Social Security up to annual limits).
CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT
Nothing in the Plan confers on you the right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or to receive an annual base salary of
any particular amount.
COMPLIANCE WITH LAW
The Plan is intended (1) to comply with Section 409A, as amended and official guidance issued thereunder, and (2) to be “a plan which is
unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or
highly compensated employees” within the meaning of sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, this Plan shall be interpreted, operated, construed and administered in a manner
consistent with these intentions.
The Company, in its reasonable discretion, may amend the Plan (including retroactively) in any manner to conform with Section 409A as
amended and official guidance issued thereunder. Despite the foregoing, the Company will not guarantee any particular tax effect to any person
of participation in the Plan. In any event, and except for tax withholding obligations, the Company will have no obligation relating to any tax or
penalty applicable to any person as a result of participation in the Plan.
For purposes of this Plan, the terms “separation from service” or “separates from service” or “separating from service” means a “separation
from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.
CLAIMS
The Company shall provide to Eligible Participants upon request, a copy of the claims procedure that shall apply in handling claims and
appeals under the Plan, which shall comply with the requirement of ERISA Section 503.
If you believe you are entitled to have received benefits but you have not received them, you must accept any payment made under the Plan and
make prompt and reasonable, good faith efforts to collect the remaining portion of the payment, as determined under Treasury Regulation
section 1.409A-3(g). For this purpose (and as determined under such regulation), efforts to collect the payment will be presumed not to be
prompt, reasonable, good faith efforts, unless you provide notice to the Plan administrator within 90 days of the latest date upon which the
payment could have been timely made in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the regulations under Section 409A, and unless, if not paid,
you take further enforcement measures within 180 days after such latest date.

EXHIBIT 10l
AIRCRAFT TIME SHARING AGREEMENT
This AIRCRAFT TIME SHARING AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between VERIZON CORPORATE SERVICES
GROUP INC., a New York corporation, having an office at One Verizon Way, Basking Ridge, New Jersey 07920 (the "Lessor"), and________________, an
individual with an address at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (the "Lessee") and shall become effective on and as of the date of
execution by the last signing party (the "Effective Date").
RECITALS
WHEREAS, Lessor rightfully possesses and has operational control of the aircraft listed on Schedule A hereto (the "Aircraft"); and
WHEREAS, Lessor employs a fully qualified flight crew to operate the Aircraft;
WHEREAS, Lessor and Lessee desire to lease said Aircraft on a non-exclusive time‑sharing basis as defined in Section 91.501(c)(1) of the Federal
Aviation Regulations ("FAR") under such terms and conditions that are mutually satisfactory to both parties; and
WHEREAS, the use of the Aircraft will at all times be pursuant to, and in full compliance with, the requirements of FAR Part 91, particularly
Sections 91.501(b)(6), 91.501(c)(1) and 91.501(d).
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:
LEASE OF AIRCRAFT
Lessor agrees to lease the Aircraft to Lessee pursuant to the provisions of FAR Sections 91.501(b)(6), 91.501(c)(1) and 91.501(d) from time to time
on a non-exclusive basis and on an "as needed and as available basis" and to provide a fully-qualified flight crew for all operations pursuant to this
Agreement.
TERM
This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and continue until such time as Lessor or Lessee terminates this Agreement. Either party
may at any time terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.
REIMBURSEMENT FOR USE OF AIRCRAFT
For each flight undertaken pursuant to this Agreement, Lessee shall pay Lessor an amount determined by Lessor which shall not exceed the direct
operating costs of the Aircraft as authorized by FAR Section 91.501(d). As of the Effective Date, those direct operating costs are limited to the following
actual expenses for each use of the Aircraft:
1)fuel, oil, lubricants and other additives;
2)travel expenses of the crew, including food, lodging and ground transportation;
3)hangar and tie down costs away from the Aircraft's base of operation;
4)insurance obtained for the specific flight;

7)in-flight food and beverages;
8)passenger ground transportation;
9)flight planning and weather contract services; and
10)an additional charge equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the expenses listed in item 1) above.
Lessor shall pay all expenses related to the operation of the Aircraft and will provide an invoice and bill to Lessee for the expenses enumerated
above within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which any flight or flights
1
for the account of the Lessee occur for domestic flights and within sixty (60) days after the end of the month in which any flight or flights for the account
of the Lessee occur for international flights. Lessee shall pay Lessor for said expenses within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice and bill.
TAXES
In addition to the amounts set forth above, Lessee shall pay to Lessor the amount of the Federal Excise Tax imposed on the amounts paid for
taxable transportation of persons (within the meaning of Section 4261 -4263 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any applicable
successor provision) for flights conducted under this Agreement. Lessor agrees to collect and remit to the appropriate governmental agency for the benefit of
Lessee all such federal excise taxes. Amounts due for such taxes shall be included on the monthly invoices and bills submitted to Lessee.
PILOTS
Lessor shall employ, pay for and provide a qualified flight crew for each flight undertaken under this Agreement.
SCHEDULING
Lessee shall provide Lessor with requests for lease of the Aircraft pursuant to this Agreement and proposed flight schedules as far in advance of any
given flight as possible, and in any case, at least 24 hours prior to Lessee's desired departure. Requests for flight time shall be in a form, whether oral or
written, mutually convenient, and agreed, to by the parties. Lessee shall provide at least the following information for each proposed flight prior to
scheduled departure:
a)proposed departure point;
b)destination;
c)date and time of flight;
d)names of all passengers;
e)nature and extent of luggage;
f)date and time of a return flight, if any; and
g)any other information concerning the proposed flight that may be pertinent or required by Lessor or Lessor’s flight crew.
Lessor shall have final authority over the scheduling of the Aircraft; provided, however, that Lessor will use its best efforts to resolve any
conflicts in scheduling in a fair and equitable manner. The pilot-in-command of the Aircraft shall have final and complete authority to cancel any flight for
any reason or condition that in his or her judgment would compromise the safety of the flight.
MAINTENANCE
Lessor shall be solely responsible for securing maintenance, preventative maintenance and required or otherwise necessary inspections on the
Aircraft. The Aircraft shall be inspected, and maintained in an airworthy condition, in accordance with applicable rules and regulations of 14 C.F.R. Part
91 during the term of this Agreement. No period of maintenance, preventative maintenance or inspection shall be delayed or postponed for the purpose of
scheduling the Aircraft for Lessee.
OPERATIONAL CONTROL
At any time during which a flight is made by or on behalf of Lessee under this Agreement, Lessor shall have possession, command and control of
the Aircraft. Lessor shall have complete and exclusive responsibility for: (i) scheduling, dispatching and flight of the Aircraft on all flights conducted
pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) the physical and technical operation of the Aircraft; and (iii) the safe performance of all flights. Lessor shall have
operational control of the Aircraft for all purposes of the Federal Aviation Regulations (found at 14 C.F.R., Parts 1-199, as amended from time to time). In
accordance with applicable FAR, the qualified flight crew provided by Lessor will exercise all required and/or appropriate duties and responsibilities in
regard to the safety of each flight conducted under this Agreement. The pilot-in-command of each flight shall have the final authority with respect to: (a)
the initiation or termination of any flight; (b) selection of the routing of any flight; (c) determination of the load to be carried; and (d) all decisions relating
to the safety of any flight. No such action of the pilot-in-command shall create or support any
2
liability to Lessee or any other person for loss, injury, damages or delay. The parties further agree that Lessor shall not be liable for delay or failure to
furnish the Aircraft and crew pursuant to this Agreement for any reason.
NEITHER LESSOR NOR ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFLIATES OR AGENTS MAKES, HAS MADE OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO
MAKE OR HAVE MADE NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR WITH RESPECT TO THE AIRCRAFT TO BE USE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ENGINE OR COMPONENT,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY AS TO DESIGN, COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFICATIONS, QUALITY OF MATERIAL
OR WORKMANSHIP, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE, USE OR OPERATION, OR AIRWORTHINESS. LESSOR SHALL
NOT BE LIABLE TO LESSEE OR HIS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, GUESTS, OR INVITEES FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR FOR LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES IN CONNECTION WITH THE
FURNISHING OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR USE OF THE AIRCRAFT, IN THE
ABSENCE OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT ON ITS PART OR THAT OF ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES OR
AGENTS. LESSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY ACT OR OMISSION OCCURING IN THE COURSE OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
USE OF THE AIRCRAFT BY LESSEE OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BY LESSOR OR ITS
OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES OR AGENTS OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH LESSEE MAY SUSTAIN OR SUFFER AS THE
RESULT, OR IN THE COURSE OF, THE DISCHARGE BY LESSOR OF ITS DUTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF GROSS

Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Verizon Comm unications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of communications,
information and entertainm ent products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencie s. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video
services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable network connectivity , security and control. We
have a highly skilled, diverse and dedicated workforce of approximately 155,400 employees as of December 31, 2017.
To compete effectively in today’ s dynamic marketplace, we are focused on transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks with a goal of future growth
based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. During 2017, we focused on leveraging our network leadership, retaining and growing our high-
quality customer base while balancing profitability , enhancing ecosystems in media and telematics, and driving monetization of our networks and solutions. Our strategy
required signi ficant capital  investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into servi ce, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in
the fiber-optic  network that supports our businesses, maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system
capabilities. We believe that steady and consistent investments in our networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth. We are
consistently deploying new network architecture and technologies to extend our leadership in both fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks. In
addition, protecting the privacy of our customers’ information and the security of our systems and networ ks will continue to be a priority at Verizon. Our network leadership
will continue to be the hallmark of our brand, and provide the fundamental strength at the connectivity , platform and solutions layers upon which we build our competitive
advantage.
Highlights of our 2017 financial results include:
• Full year earnings of $7.37  per share on a United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis.
• Total operating revenue for the year was $126.0 billion .
• Total operating income for the year was $27.4 billion , with an operating mar gin of 21.8%.
• Net income for the year was $30.6 billion .
• In 2017, cash flow from operations totaled $25.3 billion .
• Capital expenditures for the year were $17.2 billion .
Business Overview
We have two report able segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services, and customer
groups, respectively .
• Total W ireless segment operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $87.5 billion , a decline of 1.9%.
• Total W ireline segment operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $30.7 billion , an increase of 0.6%.
• Our Media business, branded Oath, had an increase in operating revenues of 89.7% to $6.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the
acquisition of Y ahoo! Inc.'s (Y ahoo) operating business in June of 2017.
Wireless
Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications products and services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the
U.S. We provide these services and equipment sales  to consumer , business and government customers across the U.S. on a postpaid and prepaid basis. A retail postpaid
connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is billed one month in advance a monthly access char ge in return for access to and
usage of network service.  Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance.
We are focusing our wireless capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-T erm Evolution (LTE) network. Approximately 98.5% of our total data traffic
during 2017 was carried on our 4G LTE network. We are investing in the densification of our network by utilizing small cell technology , in-building solutions and distributed
antenna syste ms. Densification enables us to add capacity to manage mobile video consumption and demand for the Internet of Things (IoT), and also positions us for the
deployment of 5G technology . Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed
and mobile 5G wireless services. We continue to work with key partners on innovation, standards development and requirements for this next generation of wireless
technology . During 2017, we deployed the largest 5G trial network in the U.S. with active customers. In November 2017, we announced that we will commercially launch 5G
wireless residential broadband services in three to five U.S. markets in 2018.
Wireline
Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, inclu ding broadband video and data services, corporate networking
solutions, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide  these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to
carriers, businesses and government customers both in the U.S. and around the world.
In our Wireline business, to compensate for the shrinking market for traditional voice service, we continue to build our Wireline segment around data, video and advanced
business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We expect our One Fiber initiative will aid in the densification of our 4G LTE wireless
network and position us for the deployment of 5G technology . The expansion of our multi-use fiber footp rint also creates opportunities to generate revenue from fiber-based
services in our Wireline business. We continue to seek ways to increase revenue and further realize opera ting and capital efficiencies as well as maximize profitability for our
Fios services.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other includ es the results of our Media business, branded Oath, our telematics and other  businesses, investments in unconsolidated businesses, unallocated
corporate expenses, pension and other employee benefit related costs and lease financing. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and
other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business
segment resul ts, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses that are not individu ally significant are included in all segment results as these items are
included in the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
Oath, our organization that combines Yahoo’ s operati ng business with our existing Media business, includes diverse media and technology brands that engage approximately a
billion people around the world. We believe that Oath, with its technology , content and data, will help us expand the global scale of our digital media business and build brands
for the future.  See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In addition, Corporate and other includes the results of our telematics businesses for all periods presented, which were reclassified from our Wireline segment effective April 1,
2016. The impact of this reclassification was insignificant to our consolidated financial statements and our segment results of operations.
We are also building our growth capabilities in the emer ging IoT market by developing business models  to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and platform
layers. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized IoT revenues (including telematics) of $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, a 52% and 40% increase,
respectively , compared to the prior year. This increase was attributable primarily to our acquisitions of Fleetmatics Group PLC (Fleetmatics) and Telogis, Inc. (Telogis) in the
second half of 2016, which enable us to provide a comprehensive suite of services and solutions in the T elematics market.
Capital Expenditur es and Investments
We continue to invest in our wireless network, high-s peed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future. During the
year ended December 31, 2017, these investments included $17.2 billion for capital expenditures. See "Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities" and "Operating Environment
and Trends" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient,
reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy .
Consolidated Results of Operations
In this section, we discuss  our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not includ ed in our segment results. In "Segment Results of Operations," we
review the performance of our two reportable segments in more detail.

2017 Compar ed to 2016
Consolidated revenues remained consistent during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decline in revenues at our Wireless segment, offset by an increase in revenues
within Corporate and other .
Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations".
Corporate and other revenu es increased $1.6 billion, or 20.7% , during  2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's
operating business on June 13, 2017, as well as fleet service revenue growth in our telematics business. These increases were partially offset by the sale (Access Line Sale) of
our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and
high-speed Internet service (HSI) and long distance voice accounts in these three states, to Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) on April 1, 2016 and the sale of 23
customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin  America (Data Center Sale) on May 1, 2017, and other insignificant transactions (see "Operating Results From Divested
Businesses" below). Durin g 2017, our Media business, branded Oath, generated $6.0 billion in revenues which represented approximately 64% of revenues in Corporate and
Other .
2016 Compar ed to 2015
The decrease in consolidated revenues during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decline in revenues at our segments, Wireless and Wireline, as well as a decline in
revenues within Corporate and other .
Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations".
Corporate and other revenu es decreased $2.2 billion, or 21.9%, during 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of the Access Line Sale that was completed on April 1, 2016. The
results of operations relate d to these divestitures included within Corporate and other are discussed separately below under the heading "Operating Results From Divested
Businesses". During 2016, our Media business repre sented approximately 46% of revenues in Corporate and other , comprised primarily of revenues from AOL Inc. (AOL),
which we acquired on June 23, 2015. Corporate and other also includes revenues from new businesses acquired during 2016 of approximately $0.1 billion.

Consolidated Operating Expenses $ 98,620  $ 98,921  $ 98,560  $ (301) (0.3) $ 361  0.4
Operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations".
2017 Compar ed to 2016
Cost of Services
Cost of services includes the following costs directly  attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted services, network
access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems support, and costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities. Aggregate customer
care costs, which include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense.
Cost of services increased during 2017 primarily due to an increase in expenses as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's operating business, an increase in content costs
associated with continued programming license fee increases and an increase in access costs as a result of the acquisition of XO Holdings' wireline business (XO) at our
Wireline segm ent. These increases were partially offset by the completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016, the Data Center Sale on May 1, 2017 and other
insignificant transactions (see "Operating Results From Divested Businesses"), the fact that we did not incur incremental costs in 2017 as a result of the union work stoppage
that commenced on April 13, 2016 and ended on June 1, 2016 (2016 Work Stoppage), and by a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit costs at our Wireline segment
primarily driven by collective bar gaining agreements ratified in June 2016.
Wireless Cost of Equipment
Wireless cost of equipment slightly decreased during 2017, primarily as a result of a decline in the number of smartphone and internet units sold, substantially offset by a shift
to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gener al and administrative expense includes: salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributab le to a service or product, bad debt charges, taxes other than income
taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, customer billing, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service fees, and rent and utilities for
administrative space. Also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed in "Cost of Services" above.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during 2017 primarily due to a decrease in severance, pension and benefit charges, an increase in the net gain on sale of
divested businesses (see "Special Items"), a decline at our Wireless segment in sales commission expense, employee related costs, bad debt expense, non-income taxes and
advertising expense, and a decrease due to the Access  Line Sale on April 1, 2016 and the Data Center Sale on May 1, 2017, and other insignificant transactions (see "Operating
Results From  Divested Businesses"). These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's operating business on June 13,
2017, acquisition and integ ration charges primarily in connection with the acquisition of Yahoo's operating  business, product realignment charges (see "Special Items") and an
increase in expenses as a result of the acquisition of XO.
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2017 primarily due to the acquisitions of Y ahoo's operating business and XO.
2016 Compar ed to 2015
Cost of Services
Cost of services decreased  during 2016 primarily due to the completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016 (see "Operating Results from Divested Businesses"), as well
as a decline in net pension and postretirement benefi t cost in our Wireline segment. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in costs as a result of the acquisition of
AOL on June 23, 2015, the launch of our mobile video application in the third quarter of 2015 and incremental costs incurred as a result of the 2016 W ork Stoppage.
Wireless Cost of Equipment
Wireless cost of equipmen t decreased during 2016 primarily as a result of a 4.6% decline in the number of smartphone units sold, partially offset by an increa se in the average
cost per unit for smartphones.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gener al and administrative expense increased  during 2016 primarily due to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2016 as compared to severance, pension
and benefit credits recorded in 2015 (see "Special Items"), an increase in costs as a result of the acquisition of AOL on June 23, 2015, and the launch of our mobile video
application in the third quarter of 2015. These increases were partially offset by a gain on the Access Line Sale (see "Special Items"), a decline in costs as a result of the
completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016  (see "Operating Results from Divested Businesses"), as well as declines in sales commission expense at our Wireless
segment and declines in employee costs at our W ireline segment.
Special Items
Special items included in operating expenses (see "Special Items") were as follows:

The change in Other income (expense), net during  the year ended December 31, 2017, compared  to the similar period in 2016, was primarily driven by early debt redemption
costs of $2.0 billion , compared to $1.8 billion  recorded during 2016 (see "Special Item" below), as well as a net loss on foreign currency translation adjustments compared to a
net gain in the 2016 period. The change in Other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the similar period in 2015, was primarily
driven by early debt redemption costs of $1.8 billion recorded during the second quarter of 2016.

Total interest costs on debt balances increased during 2017 primarily due to higher average debt balances. Total interest costs on debt balances decreased during 2016 primarily
due to lower average debt balances and a lower ef fective interest rate (see "Consolidated Financial Condition").
Capitalized interest costs were higher in 2016 primarily due to an increase in wireless licenses that are currently under development, including those licenses we acquired in the
FCC spectrum license auction during 2015. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the (benefit) provision for income taxes by incom e before income taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2017 was
(48.3)%  compared to 35.2%  for 2016. The decrease in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was due to a one-time, non-cash income tax benefit
recorded in the current period as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on December 22, 2017. The TCJA significantly revised the U.S. federal
corporate income tax by, among other things, loweri ng the corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018 and imposing a mandatory repatriation tax on accumulated
foreign earnings. U.S. GAA P accounting for income taxes requires that Verizon record the impacts of any tax law change on our deferred income taxes in the quarter that the
tax law change is enacted. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 allows us to provide a
provisional estimate of the impacts of the legislation. Verizon has provisionally estimated, based on curren tly available information, that the enactment of the TCJA results in a
one-time reduction in net deferred income tax liabilit ies of approximately $16.8 billion, primarily due to the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower 21%
U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, and no impact from the repatriation tax. This provisional estimate does not reflect the effects of any state tax law changes that may arise
as a result of federal tax reform. Verizon will continue to analyze the effects of the TCJA on its financial statements and operations and include any adjustments to tax expense
or benefit from continuing operations in the reporting periods that such adjustments are determined, consistent with the one-year measurement period set forth in SAB 1 18.
The effective income tax rate for 2016 was 35.2% compared to 34.9% for 2015. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of $527 million
included in the provision for income taxes from goodwill not deductible for tax purposes in connection with the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016. This increase was partially
offset by the impact that lower income before income taxes in the current period has on each of the reconciling items specified in the table included in Note 11 to the
consolidated financial statements. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to lower income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit
charges recorded in 2016 compared to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015.
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the ef fective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 1 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Consolidated Net Income, Operating Income and EBITDA
Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below ,
are non-GAAP measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more
variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in
evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon’ s competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
expense, equity in losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income (expense), net to net income.
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding the effect of special items from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA. We believe this measure is useful to
management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is
consistent with management’ s evaluation of business performance. We believe Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company’ s operating
performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation policies. Further , the exclusion of special items enables
comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. See "Special Items" for additional details regarding these special items.
Operating expenses include pension and other postretirement benefit related credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates and an
estimated return on plan assets. Such estimates are updated at least annually at the end of the fiscal year to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions
or more frequently if significant events arise which require an interim remeasurement. The adjustment has been recognized in the income statement during the fourth quarter or
upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains/losse s. We believe the exclusion of these actuarial gains or losses enables
management, investors and other users of our financial information to assess our performance on a more comparable basis and is consistent with management’ s own evaluation
of performance.
It is management’ s intent to provide non-GAAP finan cial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’ s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by
the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAA P. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the
corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that non-GAAP measures provide relevant and
useful information, which is used by management,
investors and other users of our financial information as well as by our management in assessing both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial
information presented may be determined or calculated dif ferently by other companies.

Segment Results of Operations
We have two report able segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services, and customer
groups, respectively . We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief
operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA), which is presented below , is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an
alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial
information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital
expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by
adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income (loss). Segment EBITDA mar gin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment
operating revenues.
You can find additional information about our segments in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

2017  Compar ed to 2016
Wireless’ total operating revenues decreased by $1.7 billion , or 1.9%, during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily as a result of a decline in service revenues, partially offset by
an increase in equipment revenues.
Accounts and Connections
Retail postpa id accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services.
Accounts include unlimited plans, shared data plans and corporate accounts, as well as legacy single conne ction plans and family plans. A single account may include monthly
wireless services for a variety of connected devices.
Retail connections represent our retail customer device postpaid and prepaid connections. Churn is the rate at which service to connections is terminated. Retail connections
under an account may include those from smartphon es and basic phones (collectively , phones) as well as tablets and other devices connected to the Internet, including retail
IoT devices. The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry . Retail
postpaid conn ection net additions decreased during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily due to an increase in disconnects of Internet devices, partially offset by a decline in
phone disconnects.
Retail Postpaid Connections per Account
Retail postpai d connection s per account is calculated by dividing the total number of retail postpaid conne ctions by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of the end of the
period. Retail  postpaid connections per account increased 2.0% as of December 31, 2017  compared to December 31, 2016 . The increas e in retail postpaid connections per
account is primarily due to an increase in Internet devices, including tablets and other connected devices, which represented 19.0% of our retail postpaid connection base as of
December 31, 2017  compared to 18.3% as of December 31, 2016 . The increase in Internet devices is primarily driven by other connected devices, primarily wearables, as of
December 31, 2017  compared to December 31, 2016 .
Service Revenue
Service revenue, which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased by $3.5 billion , or 5.2%, during
2017  compared to 2016 , primarily due to lower postpaid service revenue, including decreased overage revenue and decreased access revenue. Overage revenue pressure was
primarily related to the introduction of unlimited pricing plans in 2017 and the ongoing migration to the pricing plans introduced in 2016 that feature safety mode and
carryover data. Service revenue was also negatively impacted as a result of the ongoing customer migration to plans with unsubsidized service pricing. The pace of migration
to unsubsidized price plans is approaching steady state, as the majority of customers are on such plans at December 31, 2017 .
Customer migration to unsubsidized service pricing was driven in part by an increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program. For
2017 , phone activat ions under the Verizon device payment program represented approximately  78% of retail postpaid phones activated compared to approximately  77% during
2016 . At December 31, 2017 , approximately 80% of our retail postpaid phone connections were on unsubsidized service pricing compared to approx imately 67% at
December 31, 2016 . At December 31, 2017 , approximately 49% of our retail postpaid phone connections have a current participation in the Verizon device payment program
compared to approximately 46% at December 31, 2016 .
Service reven ue plus recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, which represents the total value received from our wireless
connections, decreased $0.6 billion, or 0.8%, during 2017  compared to 2016 .
Retail postpai d ARPA (the average service revenue per account from retail postpaid accounts), which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the
Verizon device payment program, was negatively impacted during 2017  compa red to 2016 , as a result of customer migration to plans with unsubsidized service pricing,
including our new price plans launched during 2016 , which feature safety mode and carryover data, and the introduction of unlimited data plans in 2017. Retail postpaid I-
ARPA (the average service revenue per account from retail postpaid accounts plus recurring device payment plan billings), which represents the monthly recurring value
received on a per account basis from our retail postpaid accounts, decreased 0.8%  during 2017  compared to 2016 . The decrease was driven by service revenue decline, partially
offset by increasing recurring device payment plan billings.
Equipment Revenue
Equipment revenue increas ed $1.4 billion , or 7.8% , during 2017  compared to 2016 , as a result of an increase in the Verizon device payment program take rate and an increase
in the price of devices, partially of fset by an overall decline in device sales.
Under the Verizon device payment program, we recog nize a higher amount of equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices. For 2017 , phone activations under the Verizon
device payment program represented approximately 78% of retail postpaid phones activated compared to approximately 77% during 2016 .
Other Revenue
Other revenue includes non-service revenues such as regulatory fees, cost recovery surchar ges, revenues associated with our device protection package, sublease rentals and
financing revenue. Other revenue increased $0.4 billion , or 8.1% , during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily due to a $0.3 billion increase in financing revenues from our device
payment program and a $0.2 billion volume-driven increase in revenues related to our device protection package.
2016  Compar ed to 2015
Wireless’ total operating revenues decreased by $2.5 billion , or 2.7% , during 2016  compared to 2015 , primarily as a result of a decline in service revenue , partially offset by
increases in equipment and other revenues.
Accounts and Connections
Retail postpaid connection net additions decreased during 2016  compared to 2015 , primarily due to a decrease in retail postpaid connection gross additions as well as a higher
retail postpaid connection churn rate.
Retail Postpaid Connections per Account
Retail postpaid connections per account increased 3.0%  as of December 31, 2016  compa red to December 31, 2015 , primarily due to increases in Internet devices, which
represented 18.3%  of our retail postpaid connection base as of December 31, 2016  compared to 16.8%  as of December 31, 2015 .
Service Revenue
Service revenue, which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased by $3.8 billion , or 5.4% , during
2016  compared to 2015 , primarily driven by lower retail postpaid service revenue. Retail postpaid service revenue was negatively impacted as a result of customer migration to
plans with unsubsidized service pricing, including our new price plans launched during 2016 that feature safety mode and carryover data. Customer migration to unsubsidized
service pricing was driven in part by an increase
in the activati on of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program. For 2016 , phone  activations under the Verizon device payment program were 77% of retail
postpaid phones activated. At December 31, 2016 , approximately 67% of our retail postpaid phone connections were on unsubsidized service pricing compared to
approximately 42% at December 31, 2015 . At December 31, 2016 , approximately 46% of our retail postpaid phone connections participated in the Verizon device payment
program compared to approximately 29% at December 31, 2015 . The decrease in service revenue was partially offset by an increase in retail postpaid connections compared to
the prior year. Service revenue plus recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, which represents the total value received from our
wireless connections, increased 2.0% during 2016 .
Retail postpaid ARPA, which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizo n device payment program, was negatively impacted during 2016  as
a result of customer migration to plans with unsubsidized service pricing, including our new price plans launched during 2016 that feature safety mode and carryover data.
Retail postpaid I-ARP A, which represents the monthly recurring value received on a per account basis from our retail postpaid accounts, increased 2.5% during 2016 .
Equipment Revenue
Equipment revenue increas ed $0.6 billion , or 3.5% , during 2016  compared to 2015 , as a result of an increase in device sales, primarily smartphones, under the Verizon device
payment program, partially of fset by a decline in device sales under the traditional fixed-term service plans, promotional activity and a decline in overall sales volumes.
Under the Verizon device payment program, we recognize a higher amount of equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , phone
activations under the V erizon device payment program represented approximately 70% of retail postpaid phones activated compared to approximately 54% during 2015 .
Other Revenue
Other revenue increased $0.7 billion , or 16.8% , during 2016  compared to 2015 , primarily due to financi ng revenues from our device payment program, cost recovery
surchar ges and a volume-driven increase in revenues related to our device protection package.

Cost of Services
Cost of servic es remained consistent during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily due to higher rent expense as a result of an increase in macro and small cell sites supporting
network capacity expansion and densification, as well as a volume-driven increase in costs related to the device protection package offered to our customers. Partially
offsetting these increases were decreases in costs related to roaming, long distance and cost of data.
Cost of services increased $0.2 billion , or 2.4% , during 2016  compared to 2015 , primarily due to higher rent expense as a result of an increase in macro and small cell sites
supporting network capacity expansion and densification, as well as a volume-driven increase in costs related to the device protection package offered to our customers.
Partially of fsetting these increases were decreases in network connection costs and cost of roaming.
Cost of Equipment
Cost of equipment decreased $0.1 billion , or 0.4% , during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily as a result of a decline in the number of smartphone and internet units sold,
substantially of fset by a shift to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold.
Cost of equipment decreased $0.9 billion , or 3.8% , during 2016  compared to 2015 , primarily as a result of a 4.6% decline in the number of smartphone units sold, partially
offset by an increase in the average cost per unit for smartphones.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $1.2 billion , or 5.8% , during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily due to a $0.6 billion decline in sales commission expense
as well as a decline of approximately $0.2 billion in employee related costs primarily due to reduced headc ount, as well as a decline in bad debt expense, non-income taxes and
advertising expense. The decline in sales commission expense was
driven by an increase in the proportion of activations under the Verizon device payment program, which has a lower commission per unit than activations under traditional
fixed-term service plans, as well as an overall decline in activations.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $1.9 billion , or 8.6% , during 2016  compared to 2015 , primarily due to a $1.2 billion decline in sales commission expense

Wireline
During the first quarter of 2017, Verizon reorganized  the customer groups within its Wireline segment. Previously , the customer groups in the Wireline segment consisted of
Mass Markets  (which included Consumer Retail and Small Business subgroups), Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale. Pursuant to the reorganization, there are now four
customer groups within the Wireline segment: Consumer Markets, which includes the customers previousl y included in Consumer Retail; Enterprise Solutions, which includes
the large business custom ers, including multinational corporations, and federal government customers previously included in Global Enterprise; Partner Solutions, which
includes the customers previously included in Global Wholesale; and Business Markets, a new customer group, which includes U.S.-based small business customers previously
included in Mass Markets  and U.S.-based medium business customers, state and local government customers, and educational institutions previously included in Global
Enterprise.
The operating revenues from XO are included in the Wireline segment results as of February 2017, following the completion of the acquisition, and are included with the
Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets customer groups. T otal operating revenues of XO for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.1 billion.
The operating results and statistics for all periods presented below exclude the results of the Access Line Sale in 2016, the Data Center Sale in 2017, and other insignificant
transactions (see "Operating Results from Divested Businesses"). The results were adjusted to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the information
regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .

(1) As of end of period
Wireline’ s revenues increa sed $0.2 billion , or 0.6% , during 2017  compared to 2016 , primarily due to increases in Business Markets, as a result of the acquisition of XO, and
Fios revenues. The 2016 W ork Stoppage negatively impacted revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Fios revenues were $11.7 billion  during 2017  compa red to $11.2 billion  during 2016 . During 2017 , our Fios Internet subscriber base grew by 3.5% and our Fios Video
subscriber base decreased by 1.6%, compared to 2016 , reflecting the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over the top of ferings.
Consumer Markets
Consumer Markets operations provide broadband Internet and video services (including HSI, Fios Internet and Fios video services) and local and long distance voice services
to residential subscribers.
2017  Compar ed to 2016
Consumer Markets revenues increased 0.2%  during 2017 compared to 2016, due to increases in Fios revenues as a result of subscriber growth for Fios Internet services fueled
by the introduction of gigabit speed data services, as well as higher pay-per -view sales due to marquee events during the third quarter , partially offset by the continued decline
of voice service and HSI revenues.
Consumer Fios revenues increased $0.4 billion, or 3.7%, during 2017 compared to 2016. Fios represented  approximately 85% of Consumer revenue during 2017 compared to
approximately 82% during 2016.
The decline in voice service revenues was primarily due to a 7.5% decline in retail residence voice connections resulting primarily from competition and technology
substitution with wireless, competing voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and cable telephony services. Total voice connections include traditional switched access lines in
service, as well as Fios digital voice connections.
2016  Compar ed to 2015
Consumer Markets revenues increased $0.1 billion , or 0.4% , during 2016 compared to 2015, due to increases in Fios revenues as a result of subscriber growth for Fios services,
partially of fset by the continued decline of voice service revenues.
Our Fios connection growt h for 2016 was impacted by the 2016 Work Stoppage. Consumer Fios revenues increased $0.4 billion, or 4.3%, during 2016 compared to 2015. Fios
represented approximately 82% of Consumer revenue during 2016 compared to approximately 79% during 2015.
The decline of voice service revenues was primari ly due to a 7.5% decline in retail residence voice connections resulting primarily from competition and technology
substitution with wireless, competing VoIP and cable telephony services. Total voice connections include traditional switched access lines in service as well as Fios digital
voice connections.
Enterprise Solutions
Enterprise Solutions helps customers deliver an adaptive enterprise, while mitigating risk and maintaining continuity , to capitalize on the data driven world and create
personalized experiences. Enterprise Solutions provides professional and integrated managed services, delivering solutions for large businesses, including multinational
corporations, and federal government customers. Enterprise Solutions of fers traditional

our traditional voice servi ces and advanced workforce productivity and customer contact center solutio ns. Our Enterprise Solutions include security services to manage,
monitor , and mitigate cyber -attacks.
2017  Compar ed to 2016
Enterprise Solutions revenues remained consistent during 2017 compared to 2016. Increased revenues resulting from the acquisition of XO were fully offset by declines in
traditional data and voice communications services as a result of competitive price pressures.
2016  Compar ed to 2015
Enterprise Solutions revenues decreased $0.2 billion , or 2.3% , during  2016  compared to 2015, due to declines in traditional data and advanced networking solutions and voice
communications services. Also contributing to the decrease was the negative impact of foreign exchange rates.
Partner Solutions
Partner Soluti ons provides  communications services, including data, voice and local dial tone and broadb and services primarily to local, long distance and other carriers that
use our facilities to provide services to their customers.
2017  Compar ed to 2016
Partner Solutions revenues decreased 0.2%  during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to declines in traditional voice revenues due to the effect of technology substitution,
as well as continuing contraction of market rates due to competition, offset by revenues resulting from the acquisition of XO. As a result of technology substitution and the
elimination of affiliate access lines due to the acquisition of XO, the number of core data circuits at December 31, 2017 decreased 26.8% compared to December 31, 2016. The
decline in traditional voice revenue was driven by a 10.1% decline in domestic wholesale connections at December 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016.
2016  Compar ed to 2015
Partner Solutions revenues decreased $0.3 billion , or 5.0% , during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to declines in data revenues and traditional voice revenues  driven by
the effect of technology substitution as well as the continuing contraction of market rates due to competition. As a result of technology substitution, the number of core data
circuits at December 31, 2016 decreased 16.3% comp ared to December 31, 2015. The decline in traditional voice revenue was driven by a 5.8% decline in domestic wholesale
connections at December 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015.
Business Markets
Business Markets offers traditional voice and networking products, Fios services, IP Networking, advanced voice solutions, security , and managed IT services to U.S.-based
small and medium businesses, state and local governments, and educational institutions.
2017  Compar ed to 2016
Business Markets revenues increased $0.2 billion , or 6.8% , during  2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the acquisition of XO, partially offset by revenue declines related
to the loss of voice and HSI connections as a result of competitive price pressures.
2016  Compar ed to 2015
Business Markets revenues decreased $0.2 billion , or 5.5% , during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to revenue declines related to the loss of voice connections as a result
of competitive price pressures.

Cost of Services
Cost of services decreased $0.4 billion , or 2.3% , during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the fact that we did not incur incremental costs in 2017 that were incurred in
2016 as a result of the 2016 W ork Stoppage, as well as a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit costs
primarily driven by collective bargaining agreement s ratified in June 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in content costs associated with continued
programming license fee increases as well as an increase in access costs as a result of the acquisition of XO.
Cost of services decreased $0.1 billion , or 0.7% , during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit cost, and a decline in
access costs driven by declines in overall wholesale long distance volumes and rates. These decreases were  partially offset by incremental costs incurred as a result of the 2016
Work Stoppage as well as an increase in content costs associated with continued programming license fee increases and continued Fios subscriber growth.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gener al and administrative expense decreased $0.2 billion , or 3.1% , during 2017 compared to 2016, due to a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit costs,
primarily driven by collective bar gaining agreements ratified in June 2016 and the fact that there were no 2016 W ork Stoppage costs in 2017, partially of fset by a 9.5% increase
in expenses resulting from the acquisition of XO.
Selling, gener al and administrative expense decreased $0.7 billion , or 9.3% , during  2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to declines in employee costs as a result of reduced
headcount, a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit costs and decreases in non-income taxes.
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in net depreciable assets as a result of the acquisition of XO.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to decreases in net depreciable assets.

Special Items
Severance, Pension and Benefit Charges (Cr edits)
During 2017, we recorded pre-tax severance, pension and benefit charges of approximately $1.4 billion, exclusive of acquisitio n related severance charges, in accordance with
our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur . The pension and benefit remeasurement charges of approximately $0.9 billion
were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension and postretirement benefit plans from a
weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2016 to a weighted-average of 3.7%  at December  31, 2017 ($2.6 billion ). The charges were partiall y offset by the difference
between our estimated return on assets of 7.0% and our actual return on assets of 14.0% ($1.2 billion ), a change in mortality assumptions primarily drive n by the use of
updated actuarial tables (MP-2017) issued by the Society of Actuaries ( $0.2 billion ) and other assumption adjustments ( $0.3 billion ). As part of these charges, we also recorded
severance costs of $0.5 billion under our existing separation plans.
During 2016,  we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit charges of $2.9 billion in accordance  with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in
the period in which they occur. The pension and benefit remeasurement charges of $2.5 billion were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to
determine the current year liabilities of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 4.6% at December 31, 2015 to a weighted-average of
4.2% at December 31, 2016 ($2.1 billion), updated health care trend cost assumptions ($0.9 billion), the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0% and our
actual return on assets of 6.0% ($0.2 billion) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion). These charges were partially offset by a change in mortality assumptions
primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2016) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.5 billion) and lower negotiated prescription drug pricing ($0.5 billion).
As part of these char ges, we also recorded severance costs of $0.4 billion under our existing separation plans.
The net pre-tax severance,  pension and benefit charges during 2016 were comprised of a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.2 billion measured as of March 31,
2016 related to settlements  for employees who received lump-sum distributions in one of our defined benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension and benefit remeasurement
charge of $0.8 billion measured as of April 1, 2016  related to curtailments in three of our defined benefit pension and one of our other postretirement plans, a net pre-tax
pension and benefit remeas urement charge of $2.7 billion measured as of May 31, 2016 in two defined benefit pension plans and three other postretirement benefit plans as a
result of our accounting for the contractual healthcare caps and bar gained for changes, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement char ge of $0.1 billion measured as of May 31, 2016
related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in three of our defined benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of
$0.6 billion measured as of August 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in five of our defined benefit pension plans, and a net
pre-tax pensio n and benefit credit of $1.9 billion as a result of our fourth quarter remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement assets and liabilities based on updated
actuarial assumptions.
During 2015,  we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit credits of approximately $2.3 billio n primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in accordance
with our accounting policy  to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur . The credits were primarily driven by an increase in our discount rate
assumption used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2014 to a weighted-average of 4.6% at December 31, 2015 ($2.5
billion), the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015 ($1.0 billion) and a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial
tables (MP-2015) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.9 billion), partially offset by the difference betwee n our estimated return on assets of 7.25% at December 31, 2014 and
our actual return on assets of 0.7% at December 31, 2015 ($1.2 billion), severance costs recorded unde r our existing separation plans ($0.6 billion) and other assumption
adjustments ($0.3 billion).
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Oper ating Income and EBITDA discussion (see "Consolidated Results of
Operations") excludes the severance, pension and benefit char ges (credits) presented above.
Early Debt Redemptions
During 2017 and 2016, we recorded losses on early debt redemptions of $2.0 billion  and $1.8 billion , respectively .
We recognize losses on early debt redemptions in Other income (expense), net on our conso lidated statem ents of income . See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information related to our early debt redemptions.
Net Gain on Sale of Divested Businesses
During the second quarter of 2017, we completed the Data Center Sale. In connection with the Data Cente r Sale and other insignificant transactions, we recorded a net gain on
the sale of divested busin esses of approximately $1.8 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2017.
During the second quarter of 2016, we completed the Access Line Sale. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0 billion in Selling,
general and administrative expense on our consolida ted statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The pre-tax gain included a $0.5 billion pension and
postretirement benefit curtailment gain due to the elimination of the accrual of pension and other postretirement benefits for some or all future services of a significant number
of employees covered in three of our defined benefit pension plans and one of our other postretirement benefit plans.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Oper ating Income and EBITDA discussion (see "Consolidated Results of
Operations") excludes the gain on the Access Line Sale described above.
Gain on Spectrum License T ransactions
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed a license exchange transaction with affiliates of T-Mobile USA Inc. (T-Mobile USA) to exchange certain Advanced Wireless
Services (AWS) and Personal Communication Servic es (PCS) spectrum licenses. As a result of this agreement, we received $0.4 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum  licenses at
fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.1 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31,
2017.
During the first quarter of 2017, we completed a license exchange transaction with affiliates of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. As a
result of this non-cash exchange, we received $1.0 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.1 billion  in Selling, general and
administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
During the first quarter of 2016, we completed a license exchange transaction with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. As a result of this
non-cash exch ange, we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.1 billion in Selling, general
and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a license exchange transaction with an affiliate of T-Mobile USA to exchange certain AWS and PCS licenses. As a result of
this non-cash exchange, we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.3 billion in Selling,
general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Oper ating Income and EBITDA discussion (see "Consolidated Results of
Operations") excludes the gains on the spectrum license transactions described above.
Acquisition and Integration Related Charges
During the second quarter of 2017, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating business. We recorded acquisition and integration related charges of approximately $0.9
billion, including $0.6 billion of acquisition related severance charges during the year ended December  31, 2017, primarily related to the acquisition of Yahoo's operating
business. These charges were primarily recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31,
2017.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Oper ating Income and EBITDA discussion (see "Consolidated Results of
Operations") excludes the acquisition and integration related char ges described above.
Product Realignment
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded product realignment charges of approximately $0.7 billion.  Product realignment costs primarily related to charges taken against
certain early-stage developmental technologies. These non-cash charges were recorded in Selling, general  and administrative expense, Cost of services, and Depreciation and
amortization expense  on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Oper ating Income and EBITDA discussion (see "Consolidated Results of
Operations") excludes the product realignment costs described above.
Impact of T ax Reform
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a one-time corporate tax reduction of approximately $16.8 billion in Benefit (provision) for income taxes  on our conso lidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Operating Envir onment and T rends
The industries that we operate in are highly competitive, which we expect to continue particularly as tradit ional, non-traditional and emer ging service providers seek increased
market share.  We believe that our high-quality customer base and networks differentiate us from our comp etitors and give us the ability to plan and manage through changing
economic and competitive  conditions. We remain focused on executing on the fundamentals of the business: maintaining a high-quality customer base, delivering strong
financial and operating results and generating strong free cash flows. We will continue to invest for growth, which we believe is the key to creating value for our shareowners.
We are investing in innovative technologies, such as 5G and high-speed fiber, as well as the platforms that will position us to capture incremental profitable growth in new
areas, like media and telematics, to position ourselves at the center of growth trends of the future.
The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry . We expect future
revenue grow th in the industry to be driven by monetization of usage through new ecosystems, and penetration increases in other connected devices including tablets and IoT
devices. Current and potential competitors in the U.S. wireless market include other national wireless service providers, various regional wireless service providers, wireless
resellers, cable companies, as well as other communications and technology companies providing wireless products and services.
Service and equipment pricing continues to play an important role in the wireless competitive landscap e. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and
devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price. As the demand for wireless data services continues to grow , we and many other wireless
service provid ers offer service plans at competitive prices that include unlimited data usage (subject to certain restrictions). We and other wireless service providers also offer
service plans that provide a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes and, in some cases, the ability to carry over unused data allowances. These
service of ferings will vary from time to time as part of promotional of fers or in response to the competitive environment.
Many wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer payment options, such as device payment plans, which provide customers with the ability to pay
for their devic e over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically , wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby , in exchange for the
customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service providers significantly , and in some cases fully, subsidized the customer ’s device purchase. We and
many other wireless provid ers have limited or discontinued this form of device subsidy . As a result, we have experienced significant growth in the percentage of activations on
device
payment plans and the number of customers on plans with unsubsidized service pricing; however , the migration is approaching steady state. We expect future service revenue
growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue and also new account formation. Future service revenue growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the
penetration of our services and increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our network and services and the development of new ecosystems.
Current and potential competitors to our Wireline businesses include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite
television companies, Internet service providers, over the top providers and other companies that of fer network services and managed enterprise solutions.
In addition, companies with a global presence increa singly compete with our Wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service
providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the globa l wholesale markets. We compete with these full or near-full service
providers for large contrac ts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these compa nies have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing
customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may af fect our future revenue growth.
Despite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our Wireline segment by providing network reliability , offering consumers product
bundles that include broad band Internet access, digital television and local and long distance voice services, offering business and government customers more robust IP
products and services, and accelerating our IoT strategies. We will also continue to focus on cost efficienc ies to attempt to offset adverse impacts from unfavorable economic
conditions and competitive pressures.
2018 Connection T rends
In our Wireless segment, we expect to continue to attract and maintain the loyalty of high-quality retail postpaid customers, capitalizing on demand for data services and
bringing our customers new ways of using wireless services in their daily lives. We expect that future connection growth will be driven by smartphones, tablets and other
connected devices such as wearables. We believe the overall customer experience of matching the unlimited plan with our high-quality network continues to attract and retain
higher value retail postpaid connections, contributes to continued increases in the penetration of data services and helps us remain competitive with other wireless carriers. We
expect to manage churn by providing a consistent, reliable experience on our wireless network and focusi ng on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing
and better execution in our distribution channels.
In our Wireline segment, we have experienced conti nuing access line losses as customers have disconn ected both primary and secondary lines and switched to alternative
technologies such as wireless, VoIP and cable for voice and data services. We expect to continue to experience access line losses as customers continue to switch to alternate
technologies. We expect to continue to grow our Fios Internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas. In Fios video, the business
continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market. We expect to expand our existing business through initiatives such as One Fiber , our
multi-use fiber deployment.
2018 Operating Revenue T rends
In our Wireless segment, we expect to see a continua tion of the service revenue trends that started in 2017  as the migration to unsubsidized pricing is largely behind us and as
we gain momentum in new account formation driven by the introduction of new pricing structures in 2016 and 2017 and the use of promotions. Equipment revenues are lar gely
dependent on wireless device sales volumes, the mix of devices, promotions and upgrade cycles, which are subject to device lifecycles, iconic device launches and competition
within the wireless industry .
In our Wireline segment, we expect segment revenue  growth driven primarily by revenue growth in Consumer Markets, offset by revenue declines in Partner Solutions. We
expect Consu mer Markets revenue growth to be driven by growth in our Fios broadband subscriber base, offset by continuing declines related to retail voice and legacy
broadband connection losses. We expect a continued decline in core revenues for our Business Markets, Enterprise Solutions and Partner Solutions customer offerings;
however , we expect revenue growth from advanced business and fiber-based services, including the expansion of our fiber footprint, to partially , and in some cases fully,
mitigate these declines for the customer groups.
Due to the implementation of Accounting Standard  Codification (ASC) Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we estimate the overall impact from the opening balance sheet
adjustment and ongoing impact from new contracts to result in an insignificant change to consolidated revenue for the full year 2018, based on currently available information,
as the expected increase to wireless equipment revenue will be of fset by an expected decrease to wireless service revenue.
We expect initiatives to develop platforms, content and applications in the media and IoT space will have a long-term positive impact on revenues, drive usage on our network
and monetize our investments.
2018 Operating Expense and Cash Flow fr om Operations T rends
We expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin to remain strong as we continue to undertake initiatives to reduce our overall
cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiency in our operations throughout the busine ss in 2018 and beyond. We have deployed a zero-based budgeting
initiative to take $10 billion of cumulative cash outflows out of the business over the next four years. As part of this initiative, we will focus on both operating expenses and
capital expenditures. Every area of the business will
be examined with significant areas of focus being network costs, distribution and customer care. Expenses related to newly acquired businesses are expected to apply offsetting
pressure to our mar gins.
Due to the implementation  of ASC Topic 606, we estimate the overall impact from the opening balance sheet adjustment and ongoing impact from new contracts to result in a
net decrease, ranging from $0.9 billion to $1.2 billion, to operating expenses primarily related to wireless  and wireline commission expenses for the full year 2018, based on
currently available information.
We expect that the T ax Cuts and Jobs Act will have a positive impact to V erizon's cash flow from operations in 2018 of approximately $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion.
We create value for our shareowners by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable growth, thereby
increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In addition, we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to shareowners.
Verizon’ s Board of Directors increased the Company’ s quarterly dividend by 2.2% during 2017, making this the eleventh consecutive year in which we have raised our
dividend.
Our goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help us to grow the business,
strengthen our balance sheet, acquire spectrum licenses (see "Cash Flows from Investing Activities"), pay dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back
shares of our outstanding common stock (see "Cash Flows from Financing Activities").
Capital Expenditur es
Our 2018 capital program  includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding our core networks, adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE
network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and pre-position our network for 5G, building out multi-use fiber to expand the future capabilities of
both our wireless and wirel ine networks while reducing the cost to deliver services to our customers and pursuing other opportunities to drive operating efficiencies. We expect
the new One Fiber architecture will also deliver high- speed Fios broadband to businesses and create new opportunities in the small and medium business market. The level and
the timing of the Company ’s capital expenditures within these broad categories can vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors outside of our control, such as material
weather events. Capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be in the range of $17.0 billion to $17.8 billion, including the commercial launch of 5G. Capital expenditures
were $17.2 billion  in 2017  and $17.1 billion  in 2016 . We believe that we have significant discretion over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures on a Company-
wide basis as we are not subject to any agreement that would require significant capital expenditures on a designated schedule or upon the occurrence of designated events.

We use the net cash generated from our operations to fund network expansion and modernization, service and repay external financing, pay dividends, invest in new businesses
and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstan ding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary , from external financing
arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements. We expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily
through intern ally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities or to maintain an appropriate capital
structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily held domesti cally and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity .
Accordingly , we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. See "Market Risk" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk
management strategies.
Our available external financing arrangements include an active commercial paper program, credit available under credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, vendor
financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other capital market securities that are privately-placed or offered
overseas. In addition, we monetize our device payment plan agreement receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.
Cash Flows Pr ovided By Operating Activities
Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations, primarily from our Wireless segment. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2017
increased by $ 2.5 billion  primarily due to an increase in earnings and changes in working capital, partially offset by our discretionary contributions to qualified pension plans
of $3.4 billion (approximately $2.1 billion, net of tax benefit) and the change in the method in which we monetize device payment plan receivables, as discussed below . As a
result of the discretionary pension contribution in 2017, our mandatory pension funding through 2020 is expected to be minimal, which will benefit future cash flows. Further ,
the funded status of our qualified pension plan is improved.
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2016 decreased by $16.2 billion primarily due to a change  in the method by which we monetize device payment plan
receivables, as discussed below , as well as a decline in earnings, an increase in income taxes paid primarily as a result of the Access Line Sale and the fact that in 2015 we
received $2.4 billion of cash proceeds as a result of our transaction ( Tower Monetization T ransaction ) with American T ower  Corporation (American Tower). We completed the
Tower Monetization Transaction in March 2015, pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless
towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion, of which $2.4 billion related to a portion of the towers for which the right-of-use has passed to the tower operator . See Note 2 to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
During 2016, we changed the strategic method by which we monetize device payment plan receivables from sales of device payment plan receivables, which were recorded
within cash flows provided by operating activities, to asset-backed debt transactions, which are recorded in cash flows from financing activities. During 2016 and 2015, we
received cash proceeds related to sales of wireless device payment plan agreement receivables of approximately $2.0 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively . See Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional infor mation. During 2017 and 2016, we received proceeds from asset-backed debt transactions of approximately  $4.3 billion
and $5.0 billion , respectively . See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and "Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities" for additional information.
Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities
Capital Expenditur es
Capital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to facilitate the intro duction of new products and services, enhance responsiveness to
competitive challenges and increase the operating ef ficiency and productivity of our networks.
Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were as follows:
(dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2017  2016  2015
Wireless $ 10,310  $ 11,240  $ 11,725
Wireline 5,339  4,504  5,049
Other 1,598  1,315  1,001
 $ 17,247  $ 17,059  $ 17,775
Total as a percentage of revenue 13.7% 13.5% 13.5%
Capital expen ditures decreased at Wireless in 2017 and 2016 primarily due to the shift in investments to fiber assets, which support the densification of our 4G LTE network
and pre-position us for 5G technology deployment. Capital expenditures increased at Wireline in 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in investments to support our multi-
use fiber deployment. Capital expenditures declined at Wireline in 2016 as a result of the avoidance of capital expenditures related to the assets included in the Access Line
Sale that were sold to Frontier in April 2016, and reduced capital spending during the 2016 W ork Stoppage.
Acquisitions
During 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , we invested $0.6 billion , $0.5 billion  and $9.9 billion , respectively , in acquisitions of wireless licenses. During 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , we also
invested $5.9 billion , $3.8 billion  and $3.5 billion , respectively , in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired.
In February 2017, Verizon acquired XO, which owns and operates one of the largest fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks, for total cash consideration of approximately $1.5
billion , of which  $0.1 billion  was paid in 2015 .
In June 2017, V erizon acquired Y ahoo's operating business for cash consideration of approximately $4.5 billion, net of cash acquired.
In December 2017, Verizo n purchased certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from WideOpenW est, Inc. (WOW!) for cash consideration of approximately
$0.2 billion .
In July 2016, we acquired T elogis, a global cloud-based mobile enterprise management business, for $0.9 billion of cash consideration.
In November 2016, we acquired Fleetmatics, a leading global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions, for $60.00 per ordinary share in cash. The
aggregate mer ger consideration was approximately $2.5 billion, including cash acquired of $0.1 billion.
In January 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum, which it identified as the A WS-3 band. Verizon participated in that auction, and was the high bidder on
181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an application to the FCC and paid $9.5 billion to
the FCC to complete payment for these licenses. The cash payment of $9.5 billion is classified within Acquisitions of wireless licenses on our consolidated statement of cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2015. In April 2015, the FCC granted us these spectrum licenses.
In June 2015, V erizon acquired AOL for cash consideration of approximately $3.8 billion, net of cash acquired.
During 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , we acquired various other businesses and investments for cash consideration that was not significant.
See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for additional information on our acquisitions.
Dispositions
During 2017,  we received net cash proceeds of $3.5 billion in connection with the Data Center Sale on May 1, 2017. We also completed other insignificant transactions during
2017.
During 2016, we received cash proceeds of $9.9 billion in connection with the completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016.
See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for additional information on our dispositions.
Other , net
In May 2015, we consummated a sale-leaseback transaction with a financial services firm for the buildings and real estate at our Basking Ridge, New Jersey location. We
received total gross proceeds of $0.7 billion resulting  in a deferred gain of $0.4 billion, which will be amortized over the initial leaseback term of twenty years. The leaseback
of the buildings and real estate is accounted for as an operating lease. The proceeds received as a result  of this transaction have been classified within Other , net investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Also in 2015, we received proceeds of $0.2 billion related to a sale of real estate.
Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities
We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters. During 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , net cash used in financing
activities was $6.7 billion , $13.4 billion  and $15.1 billion , respectively .
2017
During 2017, our net cash used in financing activities of $6.7 billion  was primarily driven by:
• $24.2 billion  used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations, which included $0.4 billion  used for repayments of asset-backed long-term
borrowings; and
• $9.5 billion  used for dividend payments.
These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $32.0 billion , which included $4.3 billion  of proceeds from our asset-backed debt
transactions.
Proceeds fr om and Repayments of Long-T erm Borr owings
At December 31, 2017, our total debt increased to $117.1 billion  as compared to $108.1 billion  at December  31, 2016. Our effective interest rate was 4.7%  and 4.8%  during the
years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively . The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest
rates do not have a material ef fect on our interest payments. See also "Market Risk" and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
At December  31, 2017, approximately $18.0 billion or 15.3% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily the
Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on a majority of our foreig n denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal
payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.
Verizon may continue to acquire debt securities issued  by Verizon and its affiliates in the future through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers,
exchange of fers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as V erizon may from time to time determine for cash or other consideration.
Other , net
Other , net financing activities during 2017 includes early debt redemption costs, see "Special Items" for additional information, as well as cash paid on debt exchanges and
derivative related transactions.
Dividends
The Verizon Board of Directors assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such factors as long-term growth opportunities, internal
cash requirem ents and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2017, the Boar d increased our quarterly dividend payment 2.2% to $0.5900  from
$0.5775  per share in the prior period. This is the eleventh consecutive year that V erizon’ s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend increase.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2017, we paid $9.5 billion  in dividends.
2016
During 2016, our net cash used in financing activities of $13.4 billion  was primarily driven by:
• $19.2 billion  used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations; and
• $9.3 billion  used for dividend payments.
These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $18.0 billion, which included $5.0 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt
transactions.
Proceeds fr om and Repayments of Long-T erm Borr owings
At December 31, 2016, our total debt decreased to $108.1 billion  as compared to $109.7 billion  at December 31, 2015. Our effective interest rate was 4.8%  and 4.9% during
the years ended December  31, 2016 and 2015, respectively . The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in
interest rates did not have a material ef fect on our interest payments. See also "Market Risk" and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
At December  31, 2016, approximately $11.6 billion or 10.7% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily the
Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on a majority of our foreig n denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal
payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.

Dividends
During the third quarter of 2016, the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 2.2% to $0.5775 from $0.565 per share in the prior period.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2016, we paid $9.3 billion in dividends.
2015
During 2015, our net cash used in financing activities of $15.1 billion  was primarily driven by:
• $9.3 billion used for repayments of long-term borro wings and capital lease obligations, including the repayment of $6.5 billion of borrowings under a term loan
agreement;
• $8.5 billion used for dividend payments; and
• $5.0 billion payment for our accelerated share repurchase agreement.
These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $6.7 billion, which included $6.5 billion of borrowings under a term loan agreement which
was used for general corpo rate purposes, including the acquisition of spectrum licenses, as well as $2.7 billion of cash proceeds received related to the Tower Monetization
Transaction attributable to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations.
Proceeds fr om and Repayments of Long-T erm Borr owings
At December  31, 2015, our total debt decreased to $109.7 billion  as compared  to $112.8 billion at December 31, 2014. The substantial majority of our total debt portfoli o
consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, chan ges in interest rates did not have a material effect on our interest payments. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information regarding our debt activity .
At December 31, 2015, approximately $8.2 billion or 7.5% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily the
Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of
foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.

Dividends
During the third quarter of 2015, the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 2.7% to $0.565 per share from $0.550 per share in the same prior period.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2015, we paid $8.5 billion in dividends.
Asset-Backed Debt
As of December 31, 2017 , the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $8.9 billion . Our asset-backed debt includes notes (the Asset-Backed Notes) issued to third-party
investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facility) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt
bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively , the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection
with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, we transfer device payment plan agreement receivables from Cellco Partnership and certain
other affiliates of Verizon (collectively , the Originators) to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers  such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon
entities retain  the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related
payments and expenses.
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment plan agreement
receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses
related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed
debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’ s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied.
The Investors or
Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt,  but do not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment
of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, Verizon has agreed to guarante e certain of the payment obligations of Cellco Partnership and the
Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreem ent receivables are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated
accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions, deposits to the segregated accounts and payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan
agreement receivables are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Repayments of our asset-backed debt and related
interest paym ents made from the segregated accoun ts are non-cash activities and therefore not reflected within Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated
statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued and the assets securing this debt are included on our consolidated balance sheets.
During Septem ber 2016 and May 2017, we entered into loan agreements through an ABS Entity with a number of financial institutions. Under these ABS loan agreements, we
have the right to prepay all or a portion of the loans at any time without penalty , but in certain cases, with breakage costs. In December 2017, we prepaid $0.4 billion . The
amount prepaid is available for further drawdowns until September 2018, except in certain circumstances.
Credit Facilities
In July 2017, we entered into credit facilities insured by various export credit agencies with the ability to borrow up to $4.0 billion  to finance equipment-related purchases. The
facilities have  borrowings available, portions of whic h extend through October 2019, contingent upon the amount of eligible equipment-related purchases made by Verizon. At
December 31, 2017 , we had not drawn on these facilities.
In September 2016, we amended our $8.0 billion  credit facility to increase the availability to $9.0 billion  and extend the maturity to September 2020 . As of December 31,
2017 , the unused borrowing capacity under our $9.0 billion  credit facility was approx imately $8.9 billion . The credit facility does not require us to comply with financial
covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. We use the credit facility for the
issuance of letters of credit and for general corporate purposes.
In March 2016, we entered  into a credit facility insure d by Eksportkreditnamnden Stockholm, Sweden (EKN), the Swedish export credit agency . As of December 31, 2017 , we
had an outstanding balance of $0.8 billion . We used this credit facility to finance network equipment-related purchases.
Common Stock
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareowner plans. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we
issued 2.8 million  common shares from Treasury stock, which had an insignificant aggregate value. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we issued 3.5 million  common
shares from Treasury stock, which had an insignific ant aggregate value. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we issued 22.6 million  common shares from Treasury
stock, which had an aggregate value of $0.9 billion .
On March 3, 2017, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a new share buyback program to repurchase  up to 100 million  shares of the company's common stock. The new
program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches  100 million , or at the close of business on February 28, 2020, whichever is sooner . The
program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. There were no
repurchases of common stock during 2017 and 2016. During 2015, we repurchased $0.1 billion of our common stock under our previous share buyback program.
In February 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion of the
Company’ s common stock. On February 10, 2015, in exchange for an up-front payment totaling $5.0 billion , Verizo n received an initial delivery of 86.2 million  shares having
a value of approximately $4.25 billion . On June 5, 2015, Verizon  received an additional 15.4 million  shares as final settlement of the transaction under the ASR agreement. In
total, 101.6 million  shares were delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $49.21 .
Credit Ratings
Verizon’ s credit ratings did not change in 2017 , 2016  and 2015 .
Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendat ions to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating or ganization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Covenants
Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely
fashion, pay taxes, maintai n insurance with responsib le and reputable insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial
transactions, maintain our properties, provide financ ial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and consolidations, and other
similar covenants.
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants.
2017 T erm Loan Agr eement
During Janua ry 2017, we entered into a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of major financial institutions, pursuant to which we could borrow up to $5.5 billion  for
(i) the acquis ition of Yahoo and (ii) general corporate purposes.  None of the $5.5 billion  borrow ing capacity was used during 2017. In March 2017, the term loan credit
agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms and as such, the related fees were recognized in Other income (expense), net  and were not significant.
Change In Cash and Cash Equivalents
Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017  totaled $2.1 billion , a $0.8 billion  decrease  compared to Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016  primarily as a
result of the factors discussed above. Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016  totaled $2.9 billion , a $1.6 billion  decrease  compared to Cash and cash equivalents
at December 31, 2015  primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GA AP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete
understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets are necessary for
ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free
cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash
flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating
activities.
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to Free cash flow:
 (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2017  2016  2015
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 25,305  $ 22,810  $ 39,027
Less Capital expenditures (including capitalized software) 17,247  17,059  17,775
Free cash flow $ 8,058  $ 5,751  $ 21,252
The changes in free cash flow during 2017 , 2016  and 2015  were a result of the facto rs described in connection  with net cash provided by operating activities and capital
expenditures. The change in free cash flow during 2017 was primarily due to an increase in earnings and changes in working capital, partially offset by our discretionary
contributions to qualified pension plans of $3.4 billion (approximately $2.1 billion, net of tax benefit) and the change in the method in which we monetize device payment plan
receivables, as discussed below . As a result of the discretio nary pension contribution in 2017, our mandatory pension funding through 2020 is expected to be minimal, which
will benefit future cash flows. Further , the funded status of our qualified pension plan is improved.
The change in free cash flow during 2016 was primarily due to a change in the method by which we monetize device payment plan receivables, as discussed below , as well as a
decline in earnings, an increase in income taxes paid primarily as a result of the Access Line Sale and the fact that in 2015 we received $2.4 billion of cash proceeds as a result
of our  Tower Monetization T ransaction  with American T ower .
During 2016, we changed the strategic method by which we monetize device payment plan receivables from sales of device payment plan receivables, which were recorded
within cash flows provided by operating activities, to asset-backed debt transactions, which are recorded in cash flows from financing activities. During 2016 and 2015, we
received cash proceeds related to sales of wireless device payment plan agreement receivables of approximately $2.0 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively . See Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional infor mation. During 2017 and 2016, we received proceeds from asset-backed debt transactions of approximately  $4.3 billion
and $5.0 billion , respectively . See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and "Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities" for additional information.
Employee Benefit Plan Funded Status and Contributions
Employer Contributions
We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units. During
2017 , 2016  and 2015 , contributions to our qualified pension plans were $4.0 billion , $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively . We also contributed $0.1 billion  to our
nonqualified pension plans each year in 2017 , 2016  and 2015 .
The company’ s overall investment strategy is to achie ve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. In an
effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match cash flows
from investments with projected benefit payments. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to
as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries; however , we also expect the strategy to result in lower
asset returns. Nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately $0.1 billion  in 2018 .
Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not
have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $1.3 billion , $1.1 billion and $0.9 billion to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2017 , 2016  and
2015 , respectively . Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $0.8 billion  in 2018 .

(1) Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
(2) See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(3) Items included in purchase  obligations are primarily commitments to purchase content and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be
used or sold in the ordinar y course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the
subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented in this table alone do
not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash position. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.
(4) Other long-term liabilities include estimated postretirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.
(5) Represents future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement for our tower transaction. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.
We are not able to make a reasonable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $2.4 billion and related interest and penalties will be settled with the respective
taxing authorities until issues or examinations are further developed. See Note 1 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Guarantees
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telepho ne company subsidiaries as well as the debt obligations of GTE LLC, as successor in interest to GTE Corporation, that
were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
As a result of the closing of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016, GTE Southwest Inc., Verizon California Inc. and Verizon Florida LLC are no longer wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Verizon, and the guarantees of $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of debentures and first mortgage bonds of those entities have terminated pursuant to their
terms.
In connection  with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers
pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.
As of December 31, 2017 , letters of credit totaling approximately $0.6 billion, which were executed  in the normal course of business and support several financing
arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Market Risk
We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
changes in investment, equity and commodity prices  and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of
derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. W e do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
It is our gener al policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing
exposure to various marke t risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to
protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely
eliminate the ef fect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings.
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support
annex agreem ents (CSA) which provide rules for collateral exchange. Our CSA agreements entered into prior to the fourth quarter of 2017 generally require collateralized
arrangements with our counterparties in connection with uncleared derivatives. At December 31, 2016 , we had posted collateral of approximately  $0.2 billion  related to
derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrang ements, which were recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheet. Prior to 2017, we had
entered into amendments to our CSA agreements with substantially all of our counterparties that suspended the requirement for cash collateral posting for a specified period of
time by both counterparties. During the first and second quarter of 2017, we paid an insignificant amount of cash to extend certain of such amendments to certain collateral
exchange arrangements. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we began negotiating and executing new ISDA master agreements and CSAs with our counterparties. The newly
executed CSAs contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as
compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We did not post any collateral at December 31, 2017 . While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the
nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of
operations or financial condition due to our diversifi ed pool of counterparties.  See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the
derivative portfolio.
Inter est Rate Risk
We are exposed to change s in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term  debt that carries floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2017 ,
approximately 76% of the aggregate principal amou nt of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements
designated as hedges. The impact of a 100-basis-poin t change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, including our
interest rate swap agreeme nts that are designated as hedges, of approximately $0.3 billion. The interest rates on substantially all of our existing long-term debt obligations are
unaffected by changes to our credit ratings.
The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2017  and 2016 . The
table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield curve.
Our sensitivity analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not significantly affected by changes in market
interest rates.

At December 31, 2016 117,580  109,029  128,007
Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principa lly receive fixed rates and pay variable rates based on the London
Interbank Of fered Rate, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expe nse. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure
of designated debt issuances.  At December 31, 2017 , the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts were $0.1 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively . At December 31,
2016 , the fair value asset and liability of these contracts were $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively . At December 31, 2017  and 2016 , the total notional amount  of the
interest rate swaps was $20.2 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively .
Inter est Rate Caps
We also have interest rate caps which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate
our interest exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financing Facility and Asset-Backed Notes. The fair value of these contracts was insignificant at December 31,
2017  and 2016 . At December 31, 2017  and 2016 , the total notional value of these contracts was $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively .
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency . The translation of incom e statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into
U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and
losses on foreign currency  transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income in Other income (expense), net. At December 31, 2017 , our primary translation
exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Y en.
Cross Curr ency Swaps
We enter into cross currency swaps to exchange British Pound  Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Australian Dollar -denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars  and to fix our cash
payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.  These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The fair value of the
asset of these contracts was $0.5 billion and insignificant at December 31, 2017  and 2016 , respectively . At December 31, 2017  and 2016 , the fair value of the liability of these
contracts was insignificant and $1.8 billion, respectively . At December 31, 2017  and 2016 , the total notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $16.6 billion and
$12.9 billion, respectively .
Critical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Critical Accounting Estimates
A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements is as follows:
•Wireless licenses and Goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wirele ss licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible
assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter , unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or
changes in circumstances during an interim period that indicate these assets may not be recoverable. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent
appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologie s in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair
value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by natur e, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is
possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing  and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market
participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates. Significant and
adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units.
Wireless Licenses
The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $88.4 billion  as of December 31, 2017 . We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting,
as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize
certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless  communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors
that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses.
In 2017 and 2016, we perfo rmed a qualitative impairm ent assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than
the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of Wireless, macroeconomic conditions
(including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin projections), the projected
financial performance of Wireless, as well as other factors. Based on our assessments in 2017 and 2016, we qualitatively concluded that it was more likely than not that the
fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
In 2015 , our quantitative impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate  wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test
date. If the estimated fair value of our aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses then an impairment charge would
have been recognized. Our quantitative impairment test for 2015 indicated that the fair value exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
In 2015, using a quantitati ve assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based
valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no
assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the
aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were required to make significant estimates about future cash flows specifically associated with our
wireless licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows and assumed terminal value and growth rates. We considered
current and expected futur e economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs
thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash flows. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or
expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our consideration of the cost of debt
and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date. Accordingly , our discount rate incorporated our estimate of the expected return a marketplace
participant would have required as of the valuation date, including the risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation date.
The terminal value growth rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’ s long-term growth rate.
Goodwill
In 2017, V erizon combined Y ahoo's operating business with our previously existing Media business to create a newly branded or ganization, Oath. At December 31, 2017 , the
balance of our goodwill was approximately $29.2 billion , of which $18.4 billion  was in our Wireless reporting unit, $4.0 billion  was in our Wireline reporting unit,
$4.6 billion was in our Media reporting unit and $2.2 billion was in our other reporting units. To determine  if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform
a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporti ng unit is less than its carrying value. If we elect to bypass the
qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires the determination of fair value of
each respective reporting unit.
In 2017  and 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Wireless reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting
unit was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors , including the business enterprise value of Wireless from the last
quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry
and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin projections), the projected financial performance of Wireless, as well as other factors. Based on
our assessments in 2017 and 2016, we qualitatively concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Wireless reporting unit exceeded its carrying value
and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
We performed  a quantitative impairment assessment for our Wireless reporting unit in 2015 and for our Wireline and other reporting units in 2017, 2016 and 2015. For 2017,
2016 and 2015, our quantitative impairment tests indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and therefore, did not result in an
impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units, the fair value of each of our reporting units would have still exceeded their book
value. However , the excess  of fair value over carrying value for Wireline continues to decline such that it is reasonably possible that small changes to our valuation inputs,
such as a decline in actual or projected operating results or an increase in discount rates, or a combination of such changes, could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the
future. For our Media reporting unit, some of our valuation inputs are dependent on discount rates, and the continued expansion of the digital advertising industry coupled
with the effective execution of our strategic plans for Oath. These valuation inputs are inherently uncertain, and an adverse change in one or a combination of these inputs
could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future.
In conjunction with our test for goodwill impairment, our Wireline reporting unit had fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by 14% and 20% in 2017 and 2016,
respectively . For our Media reporting unit, its fair value exceeded its carrying amount by more than 20% in 2017.
Under our quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market approach
includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components—
projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the
discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present
value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the WACC, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the
valuation date.
•We maintain benefit plans  for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2017 , in the
aggregate, pension plan benefit obligations exceeded  the fair value of pension plan assets, which will result in higher future pension plan expense. Other postretirement
benefit plans have larger benefit obligations than plan assets, resulting in expense. Significant benefit plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate
of return on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income, expense,
assets and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. A sensitivity
analysis of the impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefit obligations and expense (income) recorded, as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a
decrease in the actual versu s expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2017  and for the year then ended pertaining to Verizon’ s pension and postretirement benefit
plans, is provided in the table below .

* In determin ing its pension and other postretireme nt obligation, the Company used a weighted-average discount rate of 3.7% . The rate was selected to approximate the
composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2017 . The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with
the time perio ds during which benefits payments are expected to occur , were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $0.3 billion
par outstanding).
The annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted the full yield curve approach to
estimate the interest cost component of net periodic  benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. We accounted for this change as a change in accounting
estimate and, accordingly , accounted for it prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Prior to this change, we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a
single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.
The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from  a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred
high-quality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit
payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.
•Our current and deferred income taxes and associate d valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in
connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items. As a global
commercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of
deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benef its taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance
with the accounting standa rd relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-s tep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances and
information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact
income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax
payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unan ticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances. See
Note 1 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
•Our Property , plant and equipment  balance represents a signi ficant component of our consolidated assets. We record Property , plant and equipment  at cost. We depreciate
Property , plant and equipment  on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We expect that a one-year increase in estimated useful lives of our Property ,
plant and equipment  would result in a decrease to our 2017  deprec iation expense of $2.7 billion and that a one-year decrease would result in an increase of approximately
$5.1 billion in our 2017  depreciation expense.
•We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our device payment plan agreem ent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure or
inability of our customers to make required payments. Our allowance for uncollectible accounts receiva ble is based on management’ s assessment of the collectability of
specific custo mer accounts  and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables
to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience
with bad debts, the general economic environment and the aging of such receivables.  If there is a deterioration  of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual
default rates on receivables  in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the
period the adjustments are made.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standard updates not yet adopted as of December 31, 2017 .
Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Wireless
Spectrum License T ransactions
From time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance
the reliability  of our network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding
our spectrum license transactions.
Tower Monetization T ransaction
In March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower  pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate  many of our wireless
towers for an upfront paym ent of $5.1 billion, which also included payment for the sale of 162 towers . See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.
Straight Path
In May 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path), a holder of millimeter wave spectrum configured for 5G
wireless servi ces, for consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approximately  $3.1 billion . Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we agree d to pay (i) Straight Path
shareholders  $184.00  per share, payable in Verizon shares, and (ii) certain transaction costs payable in cash of approximately  $0.7 billion , consisting primarily of a fee to be
paid to the FCC.  The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, and  is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018.
Wireline
Access Line Sale
In February 2015, we enter ed into a definitive agreement with Frontier  pursuant to which Verizon sold its local exchange business and related landline activities in California,
Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these
three states, for approxima tely $10.5 billion  (approximately $7.3 billion  net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion  of
indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier . The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange carriers in
California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The transaction closed on April 1, 2016.  See Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.
XO Holdings
In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire  XO, which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based  IP and Ethernet networks in the U.S.
Concurrently , we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-own ed subsidiary of XO Holdings,  NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink),
that holds its wireless spectrum, which included an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy the subsidiary . In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of XO for total
cash consideration of approximately  $1.5 billion , of which  $0.1 billion  was paid in 2015 .
In April 2017, we exercised our option to buy NextL ink for approximately  $0.5 billion , subject to certain adjustments. The transaction closed in January 2018. The spectrum
acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment.
Data Center Sale
In December  2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in Marc h 2017, with Equinix  Inc. pursuant to which we agreed to sell 23
customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately  $3.6 billion , subject to certain adjustments . The transaction closed in May 2017.
WideOpenW est, Inc.
In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from  WOW! , a leading provider of
communications services. The transaction closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! will complete the
build-out of the network assets we acquired by the second half of 2018. The total cash consideration for the transactions is expected to be approximately  $0.3 billion , of which
$0.2 billion  is related to the transaction that closed in December 2017.
Other
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
In May 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement  with AOL  pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
AOL at a price of $50.00  per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.  On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and
merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately  $3.8
billion . Holders of approximately  6.6 million  shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law. If they had not exercised these rights, Verizon would have paid an
additional  $330 million  for such shares at the closing.
AOL was a leader in the digital content and advertisin g platform space. Verizon has been investing in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and
advertising. AOL’s busines s model aligns with this approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform
enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams.  See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Acquisition of Y ahoo! Inc.’ s Operating Business
In July 2016, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo . Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms  and subject to the
conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’ s operating business for approximately  $4.83 billion  in cash,
subject to certain adjustments (the T ransaction).
In February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Transaction purchase price was reduced by $350 million  to
approximately  $4.48 billion  in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties also agreed that certain user security and data breaches incurred by
Yahoo (and the losses arising therefrom) were to be disregarded (1) for purposes of specified conditions to Verizon’ s obligations to close the Transaction and (2) in determining
whether a "Business Material Adverse Ef fect" under the Purchase Agreement has occurred.
Concurrently with the amendment of the Purchase Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo that Verizon agreed to purchase pursuant
to the Transaction, also entered into an amendment to the related reorganization agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo (which has changed its name to Altaba Inc. following the
closing of the Transaction) retains  50% of certa in post-closing liabilities arising out of governmental or third-party investigations, litigations or other claims related to certain
user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo prior to its acquisition by Verizon, including an August 2013 data breach disclosed by Yahoo on December 14, 2016. At that
time, Yahoo disclosed that more than one billion of the approximately three billion accounts existing in 2013 had likely been affected. In accordance with the original
Transaction agreements, Yahoo will continue to retain  100%  of any liabili ties arising out of any shareholder lawsuits (including derivative claims) and investigation s and
actions by the SEC.
In June 2017, we completed the T ransaction. The aggregate purchase consideration of the T ransaction was approximately  $4.7 billion , including cash acquired of $0.2 billion .
Prior to the closing of the Transaction, pursuant to a related reorganization agreement, Yahoo transferred all of the assets and liabilities constituting Yahoo’ s operating business
to the subsidiaries that we acquired in the Transactio n. The assets that we acquired did not include Yahoo’s ownership interests in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan and certain other
investments, certain undeveloped land recently divested by Yahoo, certain non-core intellectual proper ty or its cash, other than the cash from its operating business we
acquired. We received for our benefit and that of our current and certain future affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to all of Yahoo’ s
intellectual property that was not conveyed with the business.
In October 2017, based upon information that we received in connection with our integration of Yahoo's operating business, we disclosed that we believe that the August 2013
data breach previously disclosed by Y ahoo af fected all of its accounts.
Oath, our organization that combines Yahoo’ s operati ng business with our existing Media business, includes diverse media and technology brands that engage approximately a
billion people around the world. We believe that Oath, with its technology , content and data, will help us expand the global scale of our digital media business and build brands
for the future.
Fleetmatics Gr oup PLC
In July 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire  Fleetmatics . Fleetmatics was a leading global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions. Pursuant to
the terms of the agreement, we acquired Fleetmatics for $60.00  per ordinary share in cash. The aggregate merger consideration was approximately  $2.5 billion , including cash
acquired of $0.1 billion . We completed the acquisition on November 7, 2016.
Other
In July 2016, we acquired T elogis , a global cloud-based mobile enterprise management software business, for $0.9 billion  of cash consideration.
From time to time, we enter into strategic agreements to acquire various other businesses and investment s. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Dir ectors and Shar eowners of V erizon Communications Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in
Internal Cont rol-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our
opinion, V erizon maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have  audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of
Verizon as of December 31, 2017  and 2016 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2017 , and the related notes and our report dated February 23, 2018  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
Verizon’ s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon's
internal control over finan cial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtainin g an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting  is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accord ance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the mainten ance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit prepar ation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provi de reasonabl e assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisit ion, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a
material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

Note 1
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Verizon Comm unications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of communications,
information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies with a presence around the world. We have two reportable segments,
Wireless and W ireline. For additional information concerning our business segments, see Note 12.
The Wireless segment provides wireless communications products and services, including wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, across the United States (U.S.)
using one of the most extensive and reliable wireless networks. We provide these services and equipment sales to consumer , business and government customers across the
U.S. on a postpaid and prepaid basis.
The Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, inclu ding broadband video and data services, corporate networking
solutions, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide  these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to
carriers, businesses and government customers both in the U.S. and around the world.
Consolidation
The method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated, equity or cost, involves an evalua tion of all significant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or
suggest evide nce of control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as variable
interest entitie s (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary . For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in
Net income and Total equity . Investments in businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are
accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for
under the cost method. Equity and cost method investments are included in Investments in unconsolid ated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Basis of Pr esentation
We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
Use of Estimates
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could dif fer from those estimates.
Examples of significant estimates include the allowa nce for doubtful accounts, the recoverability of property , plant and equipment, the recoverability of intangible assets and
other long-liv ed assets, fair values of financial instrum ents, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, accrued expenses, pension and postretirement benefit
obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations.

Multiple Deliverable Arrangements
We offer products and services to our wireless and wireline customers through bundled arrangements. These arrangements involve multiple deliverables, which may include
products, services or a combination of products and services.
Wireless
Our Wireless segment earns revenue primarily by providing access to and usage of its network, as well as the sale of equipment. In general, access revenue is billed one month
in advance and recognized when earned. Usage revenue is generally billed in arrears and recognized when service is rendered. Equipment sales revenue associated with the
sale of wireless devices and accessories is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer , as this is considered to be a separate earnings
process from providing wireless services. For agreem ents involving the resale of third-party services in which we are considered the primary obligor in the arrangements, we
record the revenue gross at the time of the sale.
Under the Verizon device  payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless device s under a device payment plan agreement. We may offer certain
promotions that allow a customer to trade in his or her owned device in connection with the purchase of a new device.
Under these types of promotions, the customer receiv es a credit for the value of the trade-in device. In addition, we may provide the customer with additional future credits that
will be applied against the customer ’s monthly bill as long as service is maintained. We recognize a liability for the trade-in device measured at fair value, which is
approximated by considering several factors, includ ing the weighted-average selling prices obtained in recent resales of devices eligible for trade-in. Future credits are
recognized when earned by the customer .
From time to time, we offer certain marketing promotions that allow our customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a certain specified portion of their required
device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order . When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to
upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right’ s fair value (not an allocated value) is recognized as a
guarantee liability and the remaining allocable consideration is allocated to the device. The value of the guarantee liability effectively results in a reduction to the revenue
recognized for the sale of the device.
In multiple element arrangements that bundle devices and monthly wireless service, revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting using a relative selling price method. At the
inception of the arrangement, the amount allocable to the delivered units of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of the monthly wireless
service (the noncontingent  amount). We effectively recognize revenue on the delivered device at the lesser of the amount allocated based on the relative selling price of the
device or the noncontingent amount owed when the device is sold.
Wireline
Our Wireline  segment earns revenue based upon usage of its network and facilities and contract fees. In general, fixed monthly fees for voice, video, data and certain other
services are billed one month in advance and recognized when earned. Revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and are based on usage is generally billed in arrears
and recognized when service is rendered.
We sell each of the services we offer on a bundled basis (i.e., voice, video and data) and separately . Theref ore, each of our products and services has a standalone selling price.
Revenue from the sale of each product or service is allocated to each deliverable using a relative selling price method. Under this method, arrangement consideration is
allocated to each separate deliverable based on our standalone selling price for each product or service. These services include Fios services, individually or in bundles, and
high-speed Internet.
When we bundle equipment with maintenance and monitoring services, we recognize equipment revenue when the equipment is installed in accordance with contractual
specifications and ready for the customer ’s use. The maintenance and monitoring services are recognized monthly over the term of the contract as we provide the services.
Installation-related fees, along with the associated costs up to but not exceeding these fees, are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer relationship period.
Other
Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising  revenue is generated by the display of graphical advertisements and
other performance-based advertising. Search advert ising revenue is generated when a consumer click s on a text-based advertisement on their screen. Agreements for
advertising typically take the forms of impression-based contracts, time-based contracts or performance-b ased contracts. Advertising revenues derived from impression-based
contracts under which we provide impressions in exchange for a fixed fee, are generally recognized as the impressions are delivered. Advertising revenues derived from time-
based contrac ts under which we provide promotions over a specified time period for a fixed fee, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, provided
that we meet and continue to meet our obligations under the contract. Advertising revenues derived from contracts under which we are compensated based on certain
performance criteria are recognized as we complete the contractually specified performance.
We are considered the principal in our programmatic advertising contracts as we are the primary obligor . We present all revenues from these contracts on a gross basis.
We report taxes imposed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions between us and our customers, net of taxes we pass through to our customers.
Maintenance and Repairs
We char ge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services as these costs
are incurred.
Advertising Costs
Costs for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the periods in
which they are incurred. See Note 14 for additional information.
Earnings Per Common Shar e
Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per common share
include the dilutive ef fect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans.
There were a total of approximately 5 million , 6 million  and 8 million  outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the computation
of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , respectively .
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates
quoted market value and includes amounts held in money market funds.
Marketable Securities
We have investments in marketable securities, which are considered "available-for -sale" under the provisions of the accounting standard for certain debt and equity securities
and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in Other assets. We continually evalu ate our investments in marketable securities for impairment due to
declines in market value considered to be other -than -temporary . That evaluation includes, in addition to persistent, declining stock prices, general economic and company-
specific evalu ations. In the event of a determination that a decline in market value is other -than-temporary , a charge to earnings is recorded for the loss and a new cost basis in
the investment is established.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at cost net of an allowance for credit losses, with the exception of device payment plan agreement
receivables, which are initially recorded at fair value based on a number of factors including historical write‑of f experience, credit quality of the customer base and other
factors such as macroecon omic conditions. We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our device payment plan agreement receivables, for
estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on
management’ s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. We
record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectib le. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on
multiple factors, including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment and the aging of such receivables.  Due to the device payme nt plan
agreement being incorpora ted in the standard Verizon Wireless bill, the collection and risk strategies continue to follow historical practices. We monitor the aging of our
accounts with device payment plan agreement receivables and write-of f account balances if collection ef forts are unsuccessful and future collection is unlikely .
Inventories
Inventory consists of wirel ess and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost (determined principally on either an average cost or first-in, first-out
basis) or market.
Plant and Depr eciation
We record property , plant and equipment at cost. Property , plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the time the asset
was placed in service.
When deprec iable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the plant accounts and any gains or losses on
disposition are recognized in income.
We capitalize and deprec iate network software purchased or developed along with related plant assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or
construction of network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-related assets.
In conn ection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property , plant and equipment during 2016 , we determin ed that the average useful lives of certain
leasehold improvements would be increased from 5 to 7 years. This change resulte d in a decrease to deprecia tion expense of $0.2 billion  in 2016 . We determined that changes
were also necessary to the remaining estimated usefu l lives of certain assets as a result of technology upgrades, enhancements and planned retirements. These changes resulted
in an increase in depreciation expense of $0.3 billion , $0.3 billion  and $0.4 billion  in 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , respectively . While the timing and extent of current deployment
plans are subject to ongoing analysis and modification, we believe that the current estimates of useful lives are reasonable.
Computer Softwar e Costs
We capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software that has a useful life in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to
internal-use network and non-network software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Planning,
software main tenance and training costs are expense d in the period in which they are incurred. Also, we capitalize interest associated with the development of internal-use
network and non-network software. Capitalized non-network internal-use software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 3 to 7 years and are
included in Other intangib le assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. For a discussion of our impair ment policy for capitalized software costs, see "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" below . Also, see Note 3 for additional information of internal-use non-network software reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of busin esses over the fair value of the identifiable net asset s acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually in
the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. To determine if goodwill  is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative
assessment. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform an impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist. The impairment
test for goodwill is perfor med at the reporting unit level and compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and a
discounted cash flow method) to its carrying value. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted
cash flow method is based on the present value of two components, a projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future
cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present
value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital,
or expe cted return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for
the excess carrying value over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. Our assessments in 2017 , 2016  and 2015  indicated that the fair value of
each of our W ireless, W ireline, Media and T elematics reporting units exceeded their carrying value and therefore did not result in an impairment.
Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization
A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to
provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover , we have determined that there are currently no legal,
regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived
intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determ ination for wireless licenses each year to determine  whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite
useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless
network.
We test our wireless licen ses for potential impairme nt annually or more frequently if impairment indic ators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and
proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. In 2017  and 2016 , we performed a qualitative assessment to determine  whether it is more likely than not that
the fair value of our wirele ss licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment, we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise
value of our Wireless segm ent, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry
revenue and EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)), margin projections, the projected financial performance of our Wireless segment, as
well as other factors. The most recent quantitative assessments of our wireless licenses occurred in 2015 . Our quantitative assessme nt consisted of comparing the estimated fair
value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggre gated carrying amount as of the test date. Using a quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our aggregate
wireless licen ses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow
generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used
to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the
aggregated wireless license s is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized. Our assessments in 2017 , 2016  and
2015  indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
Interest expen se incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization
period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets
Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal- use software) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All of
our intangible assets subjec t to amortization, and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recov erability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the
net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generate d from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the
next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any . We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to
determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.
For informati on related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other
acquired intangible assets, see Note 3.
Fair V alue Measur ements
Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the
methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3—No observable pricing inputs in the market
Financial assets and financ ial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their
categorization within the fair value hierarchy .
Income T axes
Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we
operate.
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are
recalculated annually at tax rates in ef fect. W e record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is
more likely than not that a tax position will be sustain ed upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of
the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate
taxing authori ty that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is
measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50
percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will
generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax
asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability .
Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our ef fective tax rate.
We recorded provisional amounts in the consolidated financial statements for the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) based upon currently available
information.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure and recognize  compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See Note 9 for
additional information.
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency . For these foreign entities, we translate income statement amounts at average exchange rates
for the period, and we translate assets and liabilities at end-of-period exchange rates. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive income, a
separate component of Equity , in our consolidated balance sheets. We report exchange gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency transactions of a long-term nature in
Accumulated other comprehensive income. Other exchange gains and losses are reported in income.
Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year, as well as interest on projected benefit obligations, are accrued currently . Prior
service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive
benefits. Expected return on plan assets is determin ed by applying the return on assets assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognized in operating results in the year in which they occur . These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon
management employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the company retiree medical subsidy . See Note 10 for additional information.
We recognize a pension or a postretirement plan’ s funded status as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we measure any unrecognized prior
service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income tax.
Derivative Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We employ risk management
strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. We do
not hold derivatives for trading purposes. See Note 8 for additional information.
We measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities on our consolida ted balance sheets. Our derivative instruments are valued primarily
using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of
derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized in earnings in the current period . For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments is recognized in earnings, along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments, along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item, are reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. For net investment hedges of certain of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is reported in Other
comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially of fset the impact of foreign currency changes on the value of our net investment.
Variable Inter est Entities
VIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additio nal subordinated financial support from other parties, have equity
investors that do not have the ability to make signifi cant decisions relating to the entity’ s operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected
losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual  returns of the entity . We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary .
The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to
absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
During the first quarter of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Emplo yee Share-Based Payment Accounting." This standa rd update intends to simplify several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
flows. This standard update was effective as of the first quarter of 2017. The adoption of this standard update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
During the first quarter of 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." The
amendments in this update eliminate the requirement to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation when an
impairment is determined to have occurred. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the
carrying amount of goodw ill. This standard update is effective as of the first quarter of 2020; however , early adoption is permitted for any interim or annual impairment tests
performed after January 1, 2017. Verizon early adopted this standard on January 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard update did not have a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
During the first quarter of 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business." The amendments in this update
provide a framework - the "screen" - in which to evaluate whether a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. The screen requires that such set is not a business when
substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. The standard also aligns the
definition of outputs with how outputs are described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard is effective as
of the first quarter of 2018; however , early adoption is permitted. Verizon early adopted this standard, on a prospective basis, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The adoption of this
standard update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
During the third quarter of 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities." The
amendments in this update simplify the application of hedge accounting and increase the transparency of hedge results. The updated standard also amends the presentation and
disclosure requirements and changes how companies can assess the ef fectiveness
of their hedging relationsh ips. Companies will now have until the end of the first quarter in which a hedge is entered into to perform an initial assessment of a hedge’ s
effectiveness. After initial qualification, the new guidance permits a qualitative effectiveness assessment for certain hedges instead of a quantitative test if the company can
reasonably support an expe ctation of high effectiveness throughout the term of the hedge. An initial quantitative test to establish that the hedge relationship is highly effective
is still required. For cash flow hedges, if the hedge is highly effective, all changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument will be recorded in Other
comprehensive income (loss). These changes in fair value will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged item impacts earnings. The standard update is effective as of the
first quarter of 2019; however , early adoption is permitted within an interim period. Verizon early adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2017. The adoption of this
standard update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 , “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” This standard update allows entities, as an accounting policy election, the option to reclassify from accumulated other
comprehensive income to retained earnings stranded tax effects resulting from the newly enacted federal corporate income tax rate in TCJA. It also allows entities to elect to
reclassify other stranded tax effects that relate to TCJA but do not directly relate to the change in the federal rate such as state taxes. The tax effects that are stranded in
accumulated other comprehensive income for other reasons such as a change in valuation allowance may not be reclassified. This standard update is effective as of the first
quarter of 2019; however , early adoption is permitted. The standard update can be applied on a retrospective basis to each period in which the ef fect of the change in the federal
income tax rate in TCJA the Act is recognized or applied it in the reporting period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard update will have on
our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, "Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic
Postretirement Benefit Cost." The amendments in this update require an employer to report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation
costs arising from services  rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost, including the recognition of prior service credits,
will be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The amendments in this update also
allow only the service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs to be eligible for capitalization when applicable. The amendments in this update would
be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and other components of net periodic benefit cost in the income statement and prospectively , on
and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in assets. Disclosures of the nature of and reason for the change in
accounting principle would be required in the first interim and annual reporting periods of adoption. This standard update is effective as of the first quarter of 2018; however ,
early adoption is permitted  as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements have not been issued. We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2018.
The impact of the retrosp ective adoption of this standard update will be an increase to consolidated operating income of approximately $2.2 billion  for the year ended
December 31, 2016 . There will be an insignifi cant impact to consolidate d operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017  and no impac t to consolidated net income
for the years ended December 31, 2017  and 2016 .
In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, "Other Income - Gains and Losses From the Derecogni tion of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope
of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets." The new guidance defines an "in substance nonfinancial asset" as an asset or group
of assets for which substan tially all of the fair value consists of nonfinancial assets and the group or subsi diary is not a business. The standard requires entities to derecognize
nonfinancial assets or in substance nonfinancial assets when the entity no longer has (or ceases to have) a controlling financial interest in the legal entity that holds the asset
and the entity  transfers control of the asset. The standard update also unifies guidance related to partial sales of nonfinancial assets to be more consistent with the sale of a
business. This standard update is effective as of the first quarter of 2018; however , early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that this standard update will have a
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In November  2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 , "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted  Cash." The amendments in this update require that cash and cash
equivalent balances in a statement of cash flows include those amounts deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. This standard update is effective as of the
first quarter of 2018; however , early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." This standard update
addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice for these issues. Among the updates, this standard update requires cash
receipts from payments on a transferor ’s beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables to be classified as cash inflows from investing activities. This standard update is
effective as of the first quarter of 2018; however , early adoption is permitted. We expect the amendment relating to beneficial interests in securitization transactions will have
an impact on our presentat ion of collections of the deferred purchase price from sales of wireless device payment plan agreement receivables in our consolidated statements of
cash flows. Upon adoption  of this standard update in the first quarter of 2018 , we expect to retrospectively reclassify approximately $0.6 billion  of collections of deferred
purchase price related to collections from customers from Cash flows from operating activities to Cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2017  and $1.1 billion  for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Fina ncial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Meas urement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." This standard
update requires that certain  financial assets be measured at amortized cost net of an allowance for estim ated credit losses such that the net receivable represents the present
value of expe cted cash collection. In addition, this standard update requires that certain financial assets be measured at amortized cost reflecting an allowance for estimated
credit losses expected to occur over the life of the assets.
The estimate of credit losses must be based on all relevant information including historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect
the collectability of the amounts. This standard update is effective as of the first quarter of 2020; however , early adoption is permitted. We intend to adopt this standard update
in the first quarter of 2020. W e are currently evaluating the impact that this standard update will have on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." This standard update intends to increase transparency and improve comparability by requiring entities
to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases, with certain exceptions. In addition, through improved disclosure requirements, the standard update will
enable users of financial statements to further understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This standard update is effective as of the first
quarter of 2019; however , early adoption is permitted . Verizon’ s current operating lease portfolio is primarily comprised of network, real estate, and equipment leases. Upon
adoption of this standard, we expect our balance sheet to include a right-of-use asset and liability related to substantially all operating lease arrangements. We have established
a cross-functi onal coordina ted implementation team to implement the standard update related to leases. We are in the process of determining the scope of arrangements that
will be subject to this standard as well as assessin g the impact to our systems, processes and internal controls to meet the standard update’ s reporting and disclosure
requirements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." This standard, along with subsequently issued updates, clarifies the
principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The standard provides a more robust
framework for addressing revenue issues; improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across  entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; and provides
more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. The standard also amends current guidance for the recognition of costs to
obtain and fulfill contracts with customers such that incremental costs of obtaining and direct costs of fulfilling contracts with customers will be deferred and amortized
consistent with the transfer of the related good or service. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the
standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the
modified retro spective method, in which case the standard is applied only to the most current period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be
recognized at the date of initial application. In August 2015, an accounting standard update was issued that delayed the effective date of this standard until the first quarter of
2018, at whic h time we will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach applied to open contracts. We have a cross-functional coordinated team working on
the implementation of this standard. Summarized below are the key impacts and areas requiring significant judgment arising from the initial adoption of T opic 606.
The ultimate impact on revenue resulting from the application of the new standard is subject to assessments that are dependent on many variables, including, but not limited to,
the terms of our contractua l arrangements and mix of business. The allocation of revenue between equipm ent and service for our wireless subsidy contracts will result in more
revenue alloc ated to equipment and recognized upon delivery , and less service revenue recognized over the contract term than under current GAAP . Total revenue over the full
contract term will be unchanged and there will be no change to customer billing, the timing of cash flows or the presentation of cash flows.
Additionally , the new standard requires the deferral of incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, which are then amortized to expense, as part of Selling, general and
administrative expense, over the respective periods of expected benefit. As a result, a significant amount of our sales commission costs, which would have historically been
expensed as incurred by our W ireless and W ireline businesses under our previous accounting, will be deferred and amortized.
Based on currently availab le information, we expect the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard to result in an increase to the opening balance of retained
earnings ranging from approximately $4.0 billion  to $4.6 billion  on a pre-tax basis.
We also evaluated the impact of Topic 606 as it relates to gross versus net revenue presentation for our programmatic advertising services and the treatment of financing
component inherent in our Wireless direct channel contracts. We concluded that we are the principal in our programmatic advertising contracts with our customers and,
therefore, we will continue to present all revenues from these contracts on a gross basis. With respect to our direct channel wireless contracts, we have concluded that our
contracts currently do not contain a significant financ ing component for our classes of customers. These conclusions will be reassessed periodically based on current facts and
circumstances.
We have identified and implemented changes to our systems, processes and internal controls to meet the standard’ s reporting and disclosure requirements.

Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Wireless
Spectrum License T ransactions
Since 2015 , we have entered into several strategic spectrum transactions including:
• In January 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65MHz of spectrum, which it identified as the Advanced Wireless Services (AWS)-3 band. Verizon participated in
that auction and was the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately
$10.4 billion . Durin g the fourth quarter  of 2014, we made a deposit of $0.9 billion  related to our participatio n in this auction. During the first quarter of 2015, we
submitted an application to the FCC and paid the remaining $9.5 billion  to the FCC to complete payment for these licenses. The cash payment of $9.5 billion  is
classified within Acquisiti ons of wireless licenses on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015. The FCC granted us these
spectrum licenses in April 2015.
• During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a license exchange transaction with an affiliate of T-Mob ile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile USA) to exchange certain AWS and
Personal Com munication Services (PCS) spectrum licenses. As a result, we received $0.4 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-
tax gain of approximately $0.3 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.
• During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum
licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in March 2016. As a result, we received $0.4 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum  licenses at fair value and recorded a
pre-tax gain of $0.1 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
• During the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of Sprint Corporation to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum
licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in September 2016. As a result, we received $0.3 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and
recorded an insignificant gain in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
• During the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T  to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. This
non-cash exchange was completed in February 2017. As a result, we received $1.0 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum  licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain
of $0.1 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
• During the first quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of Sprint Corporation to exchange certain PCS spectrum licenses. This
non-cash exchange was completed in May 2017. As a result, we received $0.1 billion  of PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded an insignificant gain in
Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
• During the third quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of T-Mobile USA to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses.
This non-cash exchange was completed in December 2017. As a result, we received $0.4 billion  of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-
tax gain of $0.1 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Tower Monetization T ransaction
In March 2015, we comple ted a transaction with American Tower  Corporation (American T ower) pursuant to which America n Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and
operate  approximately 11,300  of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion . Under the terms of the leases, American Tower has exclusive rights to lease and
operate the towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on
their anticipat ed fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion . We have subleased capacity on the towers
from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew . The upfront payment, including the towers sold, which is primarily included
within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, was accounted for as deferred rent and as a financing obligation. The $2.4 billion  accounted for as deferred rent,
which is presented within Other, net cash flows provided by operating activities, relates to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use has passed to the tower operator .
The $2.7 billion  accounted for as a financing obligation, which is presented within Other , net cash flows used in financing activities, relates to the portion of the towers that we
continue to occupy and use for network operations. See Note 5 for additional information.
Straight Path
In May 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path), a holder of millimeter wave spectrum configured for fifth-
generation ( 5G) wireless services, for consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approximately  $3.1 billion . Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we agreed to pay
(i) Straight Path shareholders  $184.00  per share, payable in Verizon shares, and (ii) certain transaction costs payable in cash of approximately  $0.7 billion , consisting primarily
of a fee to be paid to the FCC.  The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory appro vals and closing conditions, and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of
2018.
Other
During 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , we entered into and completed various other wireless license transactions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.
Wireline
Access Line Sale
In February 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier  Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon sold its local exchange business and
related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and
long distance voice accounts in these three states, for approximately  $10.5 billion  (approximately $7.3 billion  net of income taxes), subje ct to certain adjustments and including
the assumption of  $0.6 billion  of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier  (Access Line Sale). The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests
of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange carriers ( ILECs ) in California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The transaction closed on
April 1, 2016.
The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million  voice connections, 1.6 million  Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million  Fios video subscribers and the
related ILEC businesses from Verizon. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, these businesses generated revenues of approximately $1.3 billion  and $5.3 billion ,
respectively , and operating income of $0.7 billion  and $2.8 billion , respectively , for Verizon. The operating results of these businesses are excluded from our Wireline segm ent
for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .
During April 2016, Verizon used the net cash proceeds received of $9.9 billion  to reduce its consolidated indebtedness. See Note 6 for additional information. The assets and
liabilities that were sold were included in Verizon’ s continuing operations and classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated
balance sheet s through the completion of the transact ion on April 1, 2016. As a result of the closing of the transaction, we derecognized property , plant and equipment of $9.0
billion , goodwill of $1.3 billion , $0.7 billion  of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations and $0.6 billion  of indebtedness assumed by Frontier .
We recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0 billion  in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2016. The pre-tax gain included a $0.5 billion  pension and postretirement benefit curtailment gain due to the elimination of the accrual of pension and other
postretirement benefits for some or all future services of a significant number of employees covered by three  of our defined benefit pension plans and one of our other
postretirement benefit plans.
XO Holdings
In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire  XO Holdings’ wireline business (XO), which owned and operate d one of the largest fiber-based  Internet
Protocol (IP) and Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently , we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO
Holdings,  NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink),  that holds its wireless spectrum, which included an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy the subsidiary . In February
2017, we completed our acquisition of XO for total cash consideration of approximately  $1.5 billion , of which  $0.1 billion  was paid in 2015 .
In April 2017, we exercised our option to buy NextL ink for approximately  $0.5 billion , subject to certain adjustments. The transaction closed in January 2018. The spectrum
acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment.
The consolida ted financial statements include the results of XO’s operations from the date the acquisition closed. If the acquisition of XO had been completed as of January 1,
2016, the results of operations of V erizon would not have been significantly dif ferent than our previously reported results of operations.
The acquisition of XO was accounted for as a busines s combination. The consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as
of the close of the acquisit ion. We recorded approximately $1.2 billion  of plant, property and equipment, $0.2 billion  of goodwill and $0.2 billion  of other intangible assets.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
recorded as a result of the XO transaction represents future economic benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill related to this acquisition is
included within our W ireline segment. See Note 3 for additional information.
Data Center Sale
In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2017, with Equinix , Inc. (Equinix)  pursuant to which we agreed to sell
23 customer -facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately  $3.6 billion , subject to certain adjustments  (Data Center Sale) . The transaction closed in
May 2017.
For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, these sites generated an insignificant amount of revenues and earnings. As a result of the closing of the transaction, we
derecognized assets with a carrying value of $1.4 billion , primarily consisting of goodwill, property , plant and equipment and other intangible assets. The liabilitie s associated
with the sale were insignificant.
In connection with the Data Center Sale and other insignificant divestitures, we recorded a net gain on sale of divested businesses of approximately $1.8 billion  in Selling,
general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
WideOpenW est, Inc.
In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreem ent to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from  WideOpenW est, Inc. (WOW! ), a leading
provider of communicatio ns services. The transactio n closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! will
complete the build-out of the network assets we acquired by the second half of 2018. The total cash consideration for the transactions is expected to be approximately  $0.3
billion , of which  $0.2 billion  is related to the transaction that closed in December 2017.
Other
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
In May 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Mer ger Agreement ) with AOL Inc. (AOL ) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all
of the outstanding shares of common stock of AOL at a price of  $50.00  per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary  of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the
closing of these transactio ns was approximately  $3.8 billion . Holders of approximately  6.6 million  shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law. If they had not
exercised these rights, V erizon would have paid an additional  $330 million  for such shares at the closing.
AOL was a leader in the digital content and advertisin g platform space. Verizon has been investing in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and
advertising. AOL’s busines s model aligns with this approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform
enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams.
The acquisition of AOL has been accounted for as a business combination. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the income,
cost and market approaches. The fair value measur ements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3
measurement as defined in ASC 820, other than long-term debt assumed in the acquisition. The income approach was primarily used to value the intangible assets, consisting
primarily of acquired technology and customer relationships. The income approach indicates value for an asset based on the present value of cash flow projected to be
generated by the asset. Projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money . The
cost approach , which estimates value by determining  the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility , was used, as appropriate, for property ,
plant and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property , less an allowance for loss in value due to
depreciation.
The following table summ arizes the consideration to AOL ’s shareholders and the identification of the assets acquired, including cash acquired of $0.5 billion , and liabilities
assumed as of the close of the acquisition, as well as the fair value at the acquisition date of AOL ’s noncontrolling interests:
(dollars in millions) As of June 23, 2015
Cash payment to AOL ’s equity holders $ 3,764

(1) During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we made cash payments of $1 million  and $179 million , respectively , in respect of acquisition-date estimated
liabilities to be paid. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining balance of estimated liabilities to be paid was $197 million .
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
recorded as a result of the AOL transaction represents future economic benefits we expect to achieve as a result of
combining the operations of AOL and Verizon as well as assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The goodwill related to this
acquisition is included within Corporate and other . See Note 3 for additional information.
Acquisition of Y ahoo! Inc.’ s Operating Business
In July 2016, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’ s operating business for approximately  $4.83 billion
in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the T ransaction).
In February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Transaction purchase price was reduced by $350 million  to
approximately  $4.48 billion  in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties also agreed that certain user security and data breaches incurred by
Yahoo (and the losses arising therefrom) were to be disregarded (1) for purposes of specified conditions to Verizon’ s obligations to close the Transaction and (2) in determining
whether a "Business Material Adverse Ef fect" under the Purchase Agreement has occurred.
Concurrently with the amendment of the Purchase Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo that Verizon agreed to purchase pursuant
to the Transaction, also entered into an amendment to the related reorganization agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo (which has changed its name to Altaba Inc. following the
closing of the Transaction) retains  50% of certa in post-closing liabilities arising out of governmental or third-party investigations, litigations or other claims related to certain
user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo prior to its acquisition by Verizon, including an August 2013 data breach disclosed by Yahoo on December 14, 2016. At that
time, Yahoo disclosed that more than one billion of the approximately three billion accounts existing in 2013 had likely been affected. In accordance with the original
Transaction agreements, Yahoo will continue to retain  100%  of any liabili ties arising out of any shareholder lawsuits (including derivative claims) and investigation s and
actions by the SEC.
In June 2017, we completed the T ransaction. The aggregate purchase consideration of the T ransaction was approximately  $4.7 billion , including cash acquired of $0.2 billion .
Prior to the closing of the Transaction, pursuant to a related reorganization agreement, Yahoo transferred all of the assets and liabilities constituting Yahoo’ s operating business
to the subsidiaries that we acquired in the Transactio n. The assets that we acquired did not include Yahoo’s ownership interests in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan and certain other
investments, certain undeveloped land recently divested by Yahoo, certain non-core intellectual proper ty or its cash, other than the cash from its operating business we
acquired. We received for our benefit and that of our current and certain future affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to all of Yahoo’ s
intellectual property that was not conveyed with the business.
In October 2017, based upon information that we received in connection with our integration of Yahoo's operating business, we disclosed that we believe that the August 2013
data breach previously disclosed by Y ahoo af fected all of its accounts.
Oath, our organization that combines Yahoo’ s operati ng business with our existing Media business, includes diverse media and technology brands that engage approximately a
billion people around the world. We believe that Oath, with its technology , content and data, will help us expand the global scale of our digital media business and build brands
for the future.
The acquisition of Yahoo’ s operating business has been accounted for as a business combination. We are currently assessing the identification and measurement of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary results, which are summarized below , will be finalized within 12 months following the close of the acquisition. The
preliminary results do not include any amount for potential liability arising from certain user security and data breaches since a reasonable estimate of loss, if any, cannot be
determined at this time. We will continue to evaluate the accounting for these contingencies in conjunction with finalizing our accounting for this business combination and
thereafter . When the valuations are finalized, any changes to the preliminary valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may result in adjustments to the preliminary
fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and goodwill.
The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the income, cost, market and multiple period excess earnings approaches. The fair value
measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820 other than
long-term debt assumed in the acquisition. The incom e approach was primarily used to value the intangible assets, consisting primarily of acquired technology and customer
relationships. The income approach indicates value for an asset based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flow is
discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money . The cost approach, which estimates value by
determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility , was used, as appropriate, for property , plant and equipment. The cost to replace a
given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property , less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.
The following table summa rizes the consideration to Yahoo’ s shareholders and the preliminary identificatio n of the assets acquired, including cash acquired of $0.2 billion , and
liabilities assumed as of the close of the acquisition, as well as the fair value at the acquisition date of Y ahoo’ s noncontrolling interests:
(dollars in millions) As of June 13, 2017Measur ement-period

(1) Adjustments to preliminary fair value measurements to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if
known, would have af fected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date.
On the closing date of the Transaction, each unvested and outstanding Yahoo restricted stock unit award that was held by an employee who became an employee of Verizon
was replaced with a Verizon restricted stock unit award, which is generally payable in cash upon the applicable vesting date. The value of those outstanding restricted stock
units on the acquisition date was approximately $1.0 billion .
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration trans ferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill is
primarily attributable to increased syner gies that are expected to be achieved from the integration of Yahoo’s operating business into our Media business. The preliminary
goodwill related to this acquisition is included within Corporate and other . See Note 3 for additional information.
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Yahoo’ s operating business from the date the acquisition closed. If the acquisition of Yahoo’ s operating business
had been completed as of January 1, 2016, the results of operations of V erizon would not have been significantly dif ferent than our previously reported results of operations.
Acquisition and Integration Related Char ges
In connection with the Yahoo Transaction, we recognized $0.8 billion  of acquisition and integration related charges during the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $0.5
billion , $0.1 billion  and $0.2 billion  related to Severance, Transaction costs and Integ ration costs, respectively . These charges were recorded in Selling, general and
administrative expense on our consolidated statements of income.
Fleetmatics Gr oup PLC
In July 2016,  we entered into an agreement to acquire  Fleetmatics Group PLC, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland (Fleetmatics ). Fleetmatics was a leading
global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions. Pursuant to the terms of the agreem ent, we acquired Fleetmatics for $60.00  per ordinary share in cash.
The aggregate mer ger consideration was approximately  $2.5 billion , including cash acquired of $0.1 billion . We completed  the acquisition on November 7, 2016.  As a result of
the transaction, Fleetmatics became a wholly-owned subsidiary of V erizon.
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Fleetmatics’ operations from the date the acquisition closed. Had this acquisition been completed on January 1,
2016 or 2015, the results of operations of Verizon would not have been significantly different than our previously reported results of operations. Upon closing, we recorded
approximately $1.4 billion  of goodwill and $1.1 billion  of other intangibles.
The acquisitio n of Fleetmatics was accounted for as a business combination. The consideration was alloca ted to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair
values as of the close of the acquisition.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
recorded as a result of the Fleetmatics transaction represents future economic benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill related to this
acquisition is included within Corporate and other . See Note 3 for additional information.
Other
In July 2016, we acquired Telogis , Inc., a global cloud-based mobile enterprise manageme nt software business, for $0.9 billion  of cash consideration.  Upon closing, we
recorded $0.5 billion  of goodwill that is included within Corporate and other .
During 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , we entered into and completed various other transactions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.
Real Estate T ransaction
On May 19, 2015, we consummated a sale-leaseback transaction with a financial services firm for the buildings and real estate at our Basking Ridge, New Jersey location. We
received total gross proceeds of $0.7 billion  resulting in a deferred gain of $0.4 billion , which  will be amortized over the initial leaseback term of twenty  years. The leaseback
of the buildings and real estate is accounted for as an operating lease. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction have been classified within Cash flows used in
investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Asset-Backed Debt
At December 31, 2017 , the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $8.9 billion . Our asset-b acked debt includes notes (the Asset-B acked Notes) issued to third-party
investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facility) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt
bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively , the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection
with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, we transfer device payment plan agreement receivables from Cellco Partnership and certain
other affiliates of Verizon (collectively , the Originators) to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers  such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon
entities retain  the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related
payments and expenses.
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment plan agreement
receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses
related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed
debt transactions, and will not be available to
pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’ s creditor s until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied. The Investors or Banks, as applicable, which
hold our asset -backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on
the debt. Under a parent support agreement, V erizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco Partnership and the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the device payment plan agreem ent receivables are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated
accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions, deposits to the segregated accounts and payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan
agreement receivables are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Repayments of our asset-backed debt and related
interest paym ents made from the segregated accoun ts are non-cash activities and therefore not reflected within Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated
statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued and the assets securing this debt are included on our consolidated balance sheets.
Asset-Backed Notes
In October 2017, we issued approximately $1.4 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior and junior Asset-Backed Notes through an ABS Entity . The Class A-1a senior
Asset-Backed Notes had an expected weighted-average life to maturity of 2.48 years at issuance and bear interest at 2.060%  per annum, the Class A-1b senior Asset-Backed

In November 2016, we issued approximately $1.4 billion  aggregate principal amou nt of senior and junior Asset-Backed Notes through an ABS Entity . The Class  A senior
Asset-Backed Notes had an expected weighted-average life to maturity of about 2.55 years at issuance and bear interest at 1.680%  per annum. The Class B junior Asset-
Backed Notes had an expected weighted-average life to maturity of about 3.32 years at issuance and bear interest at 2.150%  per annum and the Class C junior Asset-Backed
Notes had an expected weighted-average life to maturity of 3.59 years at issuance and bear interest at 2.360%  per annum.
In July 2016, we issued approximately $1.2 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior and junior Asset-Backed Notes through an ABS Entity , of which $1.1 billion  of notes
were sold to Investors. The Class A senior Asset-Backed Notes had an expected weighted-average life to maturity of about 2.52 years at issuance and bear interest at 1.420%
per annum. The Class B junior Asset-Backed Notes had an expected weighted-average life to maturity of about 3.24 years at issuance and bear interest at 1.460%  per annum
and the Class C junior Asset-Backed Notes had an expected weighted-average life to maturity of 3.51 years at issuance and bear interest at 1.610%  per annum.
Under the terms of each series of Asset-Backed Notes, there is a two year revolving period during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity .
ABS Financing Facility
During Septe mber 2016, we entered into a loan agreement through an ABS Entity with a number of financial institutions. Under the terms of the loan agreement, such
counterparties made advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement receivables for proceeds of $1.5 billion . We had the option of requesting an
additional $1.5 billion  of committed  funding by December 31, 2016 and during December 2016, we received additional funding of $1.0 billion  under this option. In May 2017,
we received additional funding of $0.3 billion  pursuant to an additional loan agreement with simil ar terms. These loans have an expected weighted-average life of about 2.4
years at issua nce and bear interest at floating rates. There is a two year revolving period, beginning from September 2016, which may be extended, during which we may
transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity . Subject to certain conditions, we may also remove receivables from the ABS Entity .
Under these loan agreements, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of the loans at any time without penalty , but in certain cases, with breakage costs. In December 2017,
we prepaid $0.4 billion . The amount  prepaid is available for further drawdowns until September 2018, except in certain circumstances.  As of December 31, 2017 , outstanding
borrowings under the loans were $2.4 billion .
Variable Inter est Entities (VIEs)
The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary as we have both the power to direct the activities of the entity that
most significantly impact the entity’ s performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receiv e benefits of the entity . Therefore, the assets, liabilities and activities
of the ABS Entities are consolidated in our financial results and are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated balance sheets.
The assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included on our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2017  2016
Assets    
Account receivable, net $ 8,101  $ 3,383
Prepaid expenses and other 636  236
Other Assets 2,680  2,383

Short-term portion of long-term debt 1,932  —
Long-term debt 6,955  4,988
See Note 7 for additional information on device payment plan agreement receivables used to secure asset-backed debt.
Early Debt Redemption and Other Costs
During 2017 and 2016, we recorded losses on early debt redemptions of $2.0 billion  and $1.8 billion , respectively .
We recognize losses on early debt redemptions in Other income (expense), net  on our consolidated statements of income  and within our Net cash used in financing  activities  on
our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Additional Financing Activities (Non-Cash T ransactions)
During both the years ende d December 31, 2017  and 2016 , we financed, primarily through vendor financing arrangements, the purchase of approximately $0.5 billion  of long-
lived assets consisting primarily of network equipment. At December 31, 2017 , $1.2 billion  relating to these financing  arrangements, including those entered into in prior years
and liabilities  assumed through acquisitions, remained  outstanding. These purchases are non-cash financing activities and therefore not reflected within Capital expenditures on
our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Guarantees
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017 , $0.8 billion  aggregate principal amount of these obligations remained
outstanding. Each guarantee will remain in place for the life of the obligation unless terminated pursuant to its terms, including the operating telephone company no longer
being a wholly-owned subsidiary of V erizon.
As a result of the closing of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016, GTE Southwest Inc., Verizon California Inc. and Verizon Florida LLC are no longer wholly-owned
subsidiaries of V erizon, and the guarantees of $0.6 billion  aggregate principal amount of debentures and first mortgage bonds of those entities have terminated pursu ant to their
terms.
We also guarantee the debt obligations of GTE LLC as successor in interest to GTE Corporation that were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003. As of December 31,
2017 , $0.7 billion  aggregate principal amount of these obligations remain outstanding.
Debt Covenants
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants.
Maturities of Long-T erm Debt
Maturities of long-term debt outstanding, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, at December 31, 2017  are as follows:
Years (dollars in millions)
2018 $ 3,308
2019 6,306
2020 6,587
2021 6,403

Note 7
Wireless Device Payment Plans
Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate service
on devices purchased unde r the device payment program pay lower service fees as compared to those unde r our fixed-term service plans, and their device payment plan charge
is included on their standard wireless monthly bill. As of January 2017, we no longer offer consumers new fixed-term service plans for phones. However we continue to
service existing plans and provide these plans to business customers.

Included in our device payment plan agreement receivables, net at December 31, 2017 , are net device payment plan agreement receivables of $10.7 billion  that have been
transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be reported in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 6 for additional information.
We may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in his or her owned device in connection with the purchase of a new device. Under these types of promotions,
the customer receives a credit for the value of the trade-in device. In addition, we may provide the customer with additional future credits that will be applied against the
customer's monthly bill as long as service is maintained. We recognize a liability for the trade-in device measured at fair value, which is determined by considering several
factors, including the weig hted-average selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices eligible for trade-in. Future credits are recognized when earned by the
customer . Device payment plan agreement receivables, net does not reflect the trade-in device liability . At December 31, 2017 , the amount of trade-in liability was
insignificant.
From time to time, we offer certain marketing promotions that allow our customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a certain specified portion of the required
device payme nt plan agreement amount as well as trading in their device in good working order . When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right
to upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation.
At the time of the sale of a device, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreeme nt receivables. We record the imputed interest as a reduction to the
related accounts receivable. Interest income, which is included within Service revenues and other on our consolidated statements of income, is recognized over the financed
device payment term.
When origina ting device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk score to measure the credit quality of a customer and to
determine eligibility for the device payment program. If a customer is either new to Verizon Wireless or has less than 210 days of customer tenure with Verizon Wireless (a
new customer), the credit decision process relies more heavily on external data
sources. If the customer has 210 days or more of customer tenure with Verizon Wireless (an existing customer), the credit decision process relies on internal data sources.
Verizon Wireless’ experien ce has been that the paym ent attributes of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their ability to pay in the future. External
data sources include obtain ing a credit report from a national consumer credit reporting agency , if available. Verizon Wireless uses its internal data and/or credit data obtained
from the credit reporting agencies to create a custom credit risk score. The custom credit risk score is generated automatically (except with respect to a small number of
applications where the information needs manual intervention) from the applicant’ s credit data using Verizo n Wireless’ proprietary custom credit models, which are empirically
derived, demonstrably and statistically sound. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely delinquent and be disconnected for
non-payment. For a small portion of new customer applications, a traditional credit report is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the
potential customer does not have suf ficient credit history . In those instances, alternate credit data is used for the risk assessment.
Based on the custom credi t risk score, we assign each customer to a credit class, each of which has a specified required down payment percentage, which ranges from zero to
100% , and specifie d credit limits. Device payment plan agreement receivables originated from customers assig ned to credit classes requiring no down payment represent the
lowest risk. Device payment plan agreement receivables originated from customers assigned to credit classes requiring a down payment represent a higher risk.
Subsequent to origination, Verizon Wireless monitors delinquency and write-of f experience as key credit quality indicators for its portfolio of device payment plan agreements
and fixed-term  service plans. The extent of our collection efforts with respect to a particular customer are based on the results of proprietary custom empirically derived
internal behav ioral scoring  models that analyze the customer ’s past performance to predict the likelihood of the customer falling further delinquent. These customer scoring
models assess a number of variables, including origination characteristics, customer account history and payment patterns. Based on the score derived from these models,
accounts are grouped by risk category to determine the collection strategy to be applied to such accoun ts. We continuously monitor collection performance results and the
credit quality  of our device payment plan agreement receivables based on a variety of metrics, including aging. Verizon Wireless considers an account to be delinquent and in
default status if there are unpaid char ges remaining on the account on the day after the bill’ s due date.
The balance and aging of the device payment plan agreement receivables on a gross basis was as follows:

Sales of W ireless Device Payment Plan Agr eement Receivables
In 2015 and 2016, we established programs pursuant to a Receivables Purchase Agreement, or RPA, to sell from time to time, on an uncommitted basis, eligible device
payment plan agreement receivables to a group of primarily relationship banks (Purchasers) on both a revolving (Revolving Program) and non-revolving (Non-Revolving
Program) basis. In December 2017, the RPA and all other related transaction documents were terminated. Under the Programs, eligible device payment plan agreement
receivables were transferred to the Purchasers for upfront cash proceeds and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, referred to as the deferred purchase
price.
There were no sales of device payment plan agreement receivables under the Programs during 2017. During 2016, we sold $3.3 billion  of receivables, net of allowance and
imputed interest, under the Revolving Program. We received cash proceeds from new transfers of $2.0 billion  and cash proceeds from reinvested collections of $0.9 billion  and
recorded a deferred purchase price of $0.4 billion . During 2015, we sold $6.1 billion  of receivables, net of allowances and imputed interest, under the Non-Revolving Program.
In connection  with this sale, we received cash proceeds from new transfers of $4.5 billion  and recorded a deferred purchase price of $1.7 billion . During 2015, we also sold
$3.3 billion  of receivable s, net of allowances and imputed interest, under the Revolving Program. In connection with this sale, we received cash proceeds from new transfers of
$2.7 billion  and recorded a deferred purchase price of $0.6 billion .
The sales of receivables under the RPA did not have a significant impact on our consolidated statement s of income. The cash proceeds received from the Purchasers were
recorded within Cash flows provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Deferr ed Pur chase Price
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we collected $0.6 billion , $1.1 billion  and an insignificant amount, respectively , which was returned as deferred purchase price and recorded
within Cash flows provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Collect ions, recorded within Cash flows used in investing activities on our
consolidated statements of cash flows were $0.8 billion  during 2017 and insignificant during 2016. During 2017, we repurchased all outstanding receivables previously sold to
the Purchasers in exchange  for the obligation to pay the associated deferred purchase price to the wholly-owned subsidiaries that are bankruptcy remote special purpose entities
(Sellers). At December 31, 2017 , our deferred purchase price receivable was fully satisfied. At December 31, 2016 , our deferred  purchase price receivable, which was held by
the Sellers, was comprised of $1.2 billion  included within Prepaid expenses and other and $0.4 billion  included within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheet. The
deferred purchase price was initially recorded at fair value, based on the remaining device payment amounts expected to be collected, adjusted, as applicable, for the time value
of money and by the timing and estimated value of the device trade-in in connection with upgrades. The estimated value of the device trade-in considered prices expected to be
offered to us by independent third parties. This estimate contemplated changes in value after the launch of a device. The fair value measurements were considered to be Level 3
measurements within the fair value hierarchy . The collection of the deferred purchase price was contingent on collections from customers.
Variable Inter est Entities (VIEs)
Under the RPA, the Sellers’ sole business consists of the acquisition of the receivables from Cellco Partnership and certain other affiliates of Verizon and the resale of the
receivables to the Purchasers. The assets of the Sellers are not available to be used to satisfy obligations of any Verizon entities other than the Sellers. We determined that the
Sellers are VIEs as they lack sufficient equity to finance their activities. Given that we have the power to direct the activities of the Sellers that most significantly impact the
Sellers’ econ omic perform ance, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the Sellers. As a result, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of the Sellers into our
consolidated financial statements.
Continuing Involvement
At December 31, 2017  and 2016 , the total portfolio of device payment plan agreement receivables, including derecognized device payment plan agreement receivables, that we
were servicing was $17.8 billion  and $16.1 billion , respectively . There were no dereco gnized device paym ent plan agreement receivables outstanding at December 31, 2017.
The outstanding portfolio of device payment plan agreement receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet, but which we continued to service, was $4.3 billion
at December 31, 2016. To date, we have collected and remitted approximately $10.1 billion , net of fees. At December 31, 2017 , no amounts remained to be remitted to the
Purchasers.
Verizon had continuing involvement with the sold receivables as it serviced the receivables. We continued to service the customer and their related receivables on behalf of the
Purchasers, including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. While servicing the receivables, the same policies and procedures were
applied to the sold receivables that applied to owned receivables, and we continued to maintain normal relationships with our customers. The credit quality of the customers we
continued to service was consistent throughout the periods presented.
In addition, we had continuing involvement related to the sold receivables as we were responsible for absorbing additional credit losses pursuant to the agreements. Credit
losses on receivables sold were $0.1 billion  during 2017  and $0.2 billion  during 2016.

(3) no observable pricing inputs in the market
Equity securities consist of investments in common stock of domestic and international corporations measured using quoted prices in active markets.
Fixed income  securities consist primarily of investme nts in municipal bonds as well as U.S. Treasury securities. We used quoted prices in active markets for the majority of our
U.S. Treasury securities, therefore these securities were classified as Level 1. For fixed income securities that do not have quoted prices in active markets, we use alternative
matrix pricing resulting in these debt securities being classified as Level 2.
Derivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substa ntial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified within
Level 2. W e use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis.
We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2017  and
2016 .
Fair V alue of Short-term and Long-term Debt
The fair value  of our debt is determined using variou s methods, including quoted prices for identical terms and maturities, which is a Level 1 measurement, as well as quoted
prices for similar terms and maturities in inactive markets and future cash flows discounted at current rates, which are Level 2 measurements. The fair value of our short-term
and long-term debt, excluding capital leases, was as follows:

The following table sets forth the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments:
   (dollars in millions)
At December 31, 2017  2016
Interest rate swaps $ 20,173  $ 13,099
Cross currency swaps 16,638  12,890
Interest rate caps 2,840  2,540
Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates based on the LIBOR,
resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt
issuances.  We record the interest rate swaps at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilitie s. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are
recorded to Interest expense, which are of fset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates.
During 2017,  we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $7.5 billion  and settled interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.5 billion . During
2016, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $6.3 billion  and settled interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.9 billion .
The inef fective portion of these interest rate swaps was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2017  and 2016 .
As of December 31, 2017  and 2016 , the following amounts were recorded on the balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:

Long-term debt $ 22,01 1 $ 13,013  $ 316  $ 113
Forwar d Inter est Rate Swaps
In order to manage our exposure to future interest rate changes, we have entered into forward interest rate swaps. We designated these contracts as cash flow hedges. During
2016, we entered into forward interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $1.3 billion  and subsequently settled all outstanding forward interest rate swaps. During 2016, a
pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion  was recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss).
Cross Curr ency Swaps
We have entered into cross  currency swaps designate d as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Australian Dollar -denominated cash
flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.
During 2017,  we entered into cross currency swaps with a total notional value of $14.0 billion  and settled $10.2 billion  notional amount of cross currency swaps. A pre-tax
gain of $1.4 billion  was recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) with respect to these swaps.
During 2016,  we entered into cross currency swaps with a total notional value of $3.3 billion  and settled $0.1 billion  notional amount of cross currency swaps upon redemption
of the related debt. A pre-tax loss of $0.1 billion  was recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) with respect to these swaps.
A portion of the gains and losses recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) was reclassified to Other income (expense), net to offset the related pre-tax foreign
currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying hedged item.
Net Investment Hedges
We have designated certain foreign currency instrum ents as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain
foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. The notional amount of the Euro-denomina ted debt as a net investment hedge was $0.9 billion  and $0.8 billion
at December 31, 2017  and 2016 , respectively .
Undesignated Derivatives
We also have the following derivative contracts which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting.
Inter est Rate Caps
We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate our interes t exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financing Facility and Asset-Backed Notes. During 2017, we entered into
interest rate caps with a notional value of $0.3 billion . During 2016, we entered  into such interest rate caps with a notional value of $2.5 billion . During 2017  and 2016 , we
recognized an insignificant increase and reduction in Interest expense, respectively .
Concentrations of Cr edit Risk
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, short-term and long-term investments, trade receivables,
including device payment plan agreement receivables, certain notes receivable, including lease receivables and derivative contracts.
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support
annex agreem ents (CSA) which provide rules for collateral exchange. Our CSA agreements entered into prior to the fourth quarter of 2017 generally require collateralized
arrangements with our counterparties in connection with uncleared derivatives. At December 31, 2016 , we had posted collateral of approximately  $0.2 billion  related to
derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrang ements, which were recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheet. Prior to 2017, we had
entered into amendments to our CSA agreements with substantially all of our counterparties that suspended the requirement for cash collateral posting for a specified period of
time by both counterparties. During the first and second quarter of 2017, we paid an insignificant amount of cash to extend certain of such amendments to certain collateral
exchange arrangements. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we began negotiating and executing new ISDA master agreements and CSAs with our counterparties. The newly
executed CSAs contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as
compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We did not post any collateral at December 31, 2017 . While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the
nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of
operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.

 Stock-Based Compensation
Verizon Long-T erm Incentive Plan
In May 2017, Verizon’ s shareholders approved the 2017 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated Verizon’ s authority to grant new awards under the Verizon
2009 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). Consistent with the 2009 Plan, the 2017 Plan provide s for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive
officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other
awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, V erizon reserved the 91 million  shares that were reserved but not issued under the 2009 Plan for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.
Restricted Stock Units
The 2009 Plan and 2017 Plan provide for grants of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). For RSUs granted prior  to 2017, vesting generally occurs at the end of the third year. For the
2017 grants, vesting generally occurs in three  equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs are generally classified as equity awards because the RSUs
will be paid in Verizon common stock upon vesting. The RSU equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at
the end of each reporting period. Dividend equivalent units are also paid to participants at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.
In connection  with our acquisition of Yahoo’ s operati ng business, on the closing date of the Transaction each unvested and outstanding Yahoo RSU award that was held by an
employee who became an employee of V erizon was replaced with a V erizon RSU award, which is generally
payable in cash upon the applicable vesting date. These awards are classified as liability awards and are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Performance Stock Units
The 2009 Plan and 2017 Plan also provide for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the 2009
Plan and 2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the
corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three -year performance cycle. The PSUs are classified as liability awards because the PSU awards are paid in
cash upon vesting. The PSU award liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Verizon common
stock as well as performan ce relative to the targets. Dividend equivalent units are also paid to participant s at the time that the PSU award is determined and paid, and in the
same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance goals achieved.
The following table summarizes V erizon’ s Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Stock Unit activity:

As of December 31, 2017 , unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’ s RSUs and PSUs was approximately $1.0 billion  and is expected to
be recognized over approximately two years.
The RSUs granted in 2017  and 2016  have weighted-average grant date fair values of $49.93  and $51.86  per unit, respectively . During 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , we paid $0.8
billion , $0.4 billion  and $0.4 billion , respectively , to settle RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
After -tax compensation expense for stock-based comp ensation related to RSUs and PSUs described above included in Net income attributable to Verizon was $0.4 billion , $0.4
billion  and $0.3 billion  for 2017 , 2016  and 2015 , respectively .
Note 10
 Employee Benefits
We maintain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans for certain employees. In addition, we main tain postretirement health care and life insurance plans for certain
retirees and their dependents, which are both contribu tory and non-contributory , and include a limit on our share of the cost for certain recent and future retirees. In accordance
with our accounting policy  for pension and other postretirement benefits, operating expenses include pension and benefit related credits and/or charges based on actuarial
assumptions, including projected discount rates, an estimated return on plan assets, and health care trend rates. These estimates are updated in the fourth quarter to reflect
actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions or upon a remeasurement. The adjustment is recognized in the income statement during the fourth quarter or
upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
Pension and Other Postr etirement Benefits
Pension and other postretirement benefits for certain  employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Modifications in benefits have been bargained from time to
time, and we may also periodically amend the benefi ts in the management plans. The following tables summarize benefit costs, as well as the benefit obligations, plan assets,
funded status and rate assumptions associated with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $21.5 billion  and $21.1 billion  at December 31, 2017  and 2016 , respectively .
2017 Postr etirement Plan Amendments
During 2017, amendments were made to certain postretirement plans related to retiree medical benefits for management and certain union represented employees and retirees. 
The impact of the plan amendments was a reduction in our postretirement benefit plan obligations of approximately $0.5 billion , which  has been recorded as a net increase to
Accumulated other comprehensive income of $0.3 billion  (net of taxes of $0.2 billion ).  The impac t of the amou nt recorded in Accumulate d other comprehensive income that
will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost is insignificant. 
2016 Collective Bar gaining Negotiations
In the collective bargaining  agreements ratified in June 2016, Verizon’ s annual postretirement benefit obligation for retiree healthcare remains capped at the levels established
by the previous contracts ratified in 2012. Ef fective January 2016, prior to reaching these new collective bar gaining
agreements, certain retirees began to pay for the costs of retiree healthcare in accordance with the provisions relating to caps in the previous contracts. In reaching new
collective bargaining agreements in 2016, there is a mutual understanding that the substantive postretirement benefit plans provide that Verizon’ s annual postretirement benefit
obligation for retiree healthcare is capped and, accor dingly , we began accounting for the contractual healthcare caps in June 2016. We also adopted changes to our defined
benefit pensio n plans and other postretirement bene fit plans to reflect the agreed upon terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreements. The impact was a
reduction in our postretire ment benefit plan obligations of approximately $5.1 billion  and an incre ase in our defined benefit pension plan obligations of approximately
$0.4 billion , which have been recorded as a net increase to Accumulated other comprehensive income of $2.9 billion  (net of taxes of $1.8 billion ). The amount recorded in
Accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the respective
plans’ participants, which, on a weighted-average basis, is 12.2 years for defined benefit pension plans and 7.8 years for other postretirement benefit plans. The above-noted
reclassification resulted in a decrease to net periodic benefit cost and increase to pre-tax income of appro ximately $0.7 billion  and $0.4 billion , respectively , during 2017 and
2016.

Amounts reclassified to net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the reclassification to Selling, general and administrative expense of a pre-tax pension and
postretirement benefit curtailment gain of $0.5 billion  ($0.3 billion  net of taxes) due to the transfer of employees to Frontier , which caused the elimination of a significant
amount of future service in three  of our defined benefit pension plans and one of our other postretirement benefit plans requiring us to recognize a portion of the prior service
credits. See Note 2 for additional information.
The estimated prior service  cost for the defined benef it pension plans that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit (income)
cost over the next fiscal year is not significant. The estimated prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from Accumulated other
comprehensive income into net periodic benefit income over the next fiscal year is $1.0 billion .
Assumptions
The weighted-average assumptions used in determining benefit obligations follow:
 Pension   Health Car e and Life  
At December 31, 2017  2016  2017  2016
Discount Rate 3.70% 4.30% 3.60% 4.20%
Rate of compensation increases 3.00% 3.00% N/A  N/A
The weighted-average assumptions used in determining net periodic cost follow:

At December 31, 2017  2016  2015  2017  2016  2015
Discount rate in ef fect for determining service cost 4.70% 4.50% 4.20% 4.60% 4.50% 4.20%

Rate of compensation increases 3.00  3.00  3.00  N/A  N/A  N/A
Effective January 1, 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the interest component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits.
Historically , we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at
the beginning of the period. We have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used
in the determ ination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We have made this change to provide a more precise measurement of interest cost by
improving the correlation between projected benefit  cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. We have accounted for this change as a change in accounting
estimate and accordingly accounted for it prospectively .
In determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 3.70%  and 3.60% , respectively . The rates were selected to
approximate the composite  interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2017 . The bonds selected had maturities that
coincided with the time periods during which benefits payments are expected to occur , were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least
$0.3 billion  par outstanding).
In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each major asset class over the subsequent 10-year
period. Those  estimates are based on a combination of factors including the current market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and historical
long-term risk premiums. To determine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset class is then weighted according to the allocation
to that investment area in the trust’ s long-term asset allocation policy .
The assumed health care cost trend rates follow:
 Health Car e and Life  
At December 31, 2017  2016  2015
Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 7.00% 6.50% 6.00%
Rate to which cost trend rate gradually declines 4.50  4.50  4.50
Year the rate reaches the level it is assumed to remain thereafter 2026  2025  2024
A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following ef fects:
 (dollars in millions)  
One-Percentage Point Increase  Decr ease
Effect on 2017 service and interest cost $ 25 $ (24)
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 532  (516)
Plan Assets
The company’ s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. While
target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed so that 60% of the assets have the objective of achieving a return  in
excess of the growth in liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds and emer ging debt) and 38% of the assets are invested as liability
hedging asset s (where cash flows from investments better match projected benefit payments, typically longer duration fixed income) and 2% is in cash. This allocation will
shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to ensure they are in line with fund objectives.
Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market efficiencies and various other factors. Due to our diversification and risk control
processes, there are no significant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector , industry , geography or company names.
Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of V erizon common stock.

The following are general descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies and inputs used to determine the fair value of each major category of assets.
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds (less than 90 days to maturity), prim arily in diversified portfolios of investment grade money market
instruments and are valued using quoted market prices or other valuation methods. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature
of these investments.
Investments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or , if no
sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds , international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix
prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over -the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last
business day of the year from published sources or , if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes.
Commingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party
custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian
of the respective plan.
The investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance, and natural resource limited partnership investments. Real estate investments are valued at
amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data.
Loans secured  by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are based
upon available and current  market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultim ately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation,
estimated fair values might dif fer significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These dif ferences could be material.
Forward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last business day of the year . Both exchange
rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified by the asset class of the underlying holdings.
Hedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager . These funds are valued in accordance with the terms of their
corresponding of fering or private placement memoranda.
Commingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate limite d partnership investments for which fair value is measured using the
NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy and are included as a reconciling item to total investments.
Employer Contributions
In 2017 , we contributed $4.0 billion  to our qualified pension plans, which included $3.4 billion  of discretionary contributions, $0.1 billion  to our nonqualified pension plans
and $1.3 billion  to our other postretirem ent benefit plans. Nonqualified pension plans contributions are estimated to be $0.1 billion  and contributions to our other
postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be $0.8 billion  in 2018 .
Estimated Futur e Benefit Payments
The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows:
   (dollars in millions)
Year Pension Benefits  Health Car e and Life
2018 $ 2,401  $ 1,246
2019 2,098  1,249

2022 1,161  1,336
2023 to 2027 5,526  6,277
Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We maintain four leveraged  employee stock ownersh ip plans (ESOP). We match a certain percentage of eligible employee contributions to certain savings plans with shares of
our common stock from this ESOP . At December 31, 2017 , the number of allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was 53 million . There were no unallocate d shares of
common stock in this ESOP at December 31, 2017 . All leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations.
Total savings plan costs were $0.8 billion  in 2017 , $0.7 billion  in 2016  and $0.9 billion  in 2015 .

Severance, Pension and Benefit Char ges (Cr edits)
During 2017,  we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit charges of $1.4 billion , exclusive of acquisition related severance charges, in accordance with our
accounting policy to recog nize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur . The pension and benefit remeasurement charges of approximately $0.9 billion  were
primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabiliti es of our pension and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-
average of 4.2%  at December 31, 2016 to a weighted-average of 3.7%  at December 31, 2017 ($2.6 billion ). The charges were partially offset by the difference between our
estimated return on assets of 7.0%  and our actual return on assets of 14.0%  ($1.2 billion ), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial
tables (MP-2017) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.2 billion ) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion ). As part of these charges, we also recorded severance costs
of $0.5 billion  under our existing separation plans.
During 2016,  we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit charges of $2.9 billion  in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in
the period in which they occur. The pension and benefit remeasurement charges of $2.5 billion  were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to
determine the current year liabilities of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 4.6%  at December 31, 2015 to a weighted-average of
4.2%  at December 31, 2016 ($2.1 billion ), updated health care trend cost assumptions ($0.9 billion ), the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0%  and our
actual return on assets of 6.0%  ($0.2 billion ) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion ). These charges were partially offset by a change in mortality assumptions
primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2016) issued by the Society of Actuaries ( $0.5 billion ) and lower negotiated prescription drug pricing ($0.5 billion ).
As part of these char ges, we also recorded severance costs of $0.4 billion  under our existing separation plans.
The net pre-tax severance,  pension and benefit charges during 2016 were comprised of a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.2 billion  measured as of March 31,
2016 related to settlements for employees who receiv ed lump-sum distributions in one of our defined benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension and benefit remeasurement
charge of $0.8 billion  measu red as of April 1, 2016 related to curtailment s in three  of our defined benefit pension and one of our other postretirement plans, a net pre-tax
pension and benefit remeasurement charge of $2.7 billion  measured as of May 31, 2016 in two defined benefit pension plans and three  other postretirement benefit plans as a
result of our accounting for the contractual healthcare caps and bar gained for changes, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement char ge of $0.1 billion  measured as of May 31, 2016
related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in three  of our define d benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.6
billion  measured as of August 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in five of our define d benefit pension plans, and a net pre-tax
pension and benefit credit  of $1.9 billion  as a result of our fourth quarter remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement assets and liabilities based on updated
actuarial assumptions.
During 2015,  we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit credits of approximately $2.3 billion  primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in accordance
with our accounting policy  to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur . The credits were primarily driven by an increase in our discount rate
assumption used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2%  at December 31, 2014 to a weighted-average of 4.6%  at December  31, 2015 ($2.5
billion ), the executio n of a new prescription drug contract during 2015 ($1.0 billion ) and a chang e in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial
tables (MP-2015) issued by the Society of Actuaries ( $0.9 billion ), partially offset by the difference between our estima ted return on assets of 7.25%  at December 31, 2014 and
our actual return on assets of 0.7%  at December  31, 2015 ($1.2 billion ), severance costs recorded under our existing separ ation plans ($0.6 billion ) and other assumption
adjustments ( $0.3 billion ).

 Taxes
The components of income before benefit (provision) for income taxes are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)

Total income tax (benefit) provision $ (9,956 ) $ 7,378  $ 9,865
The following table shows the principal reasons for the dif ference between the ef fective income tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate:
Years Ended December 31, 2017  2016  2015
Statutory federal income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %
State and local income tax rate, net of federal tax benefits 1.6  2.2  2.1
Affordable housing credit (0.6) (0.7) (0.5)
Employee benefits including ESOP dividend (0.5) (0.5) (0.4)
Impact of tax reform re-measurement (81.6 ) —  —
Noncontrolling interests (0.6) (0.6) (0.5)
Non-deductible goodwill 1.0  2.2  —
Other , net (2.6) (2.4) (0.8)
Effective income tax rate (48.3 )% 35.2 % 34.9 %
The ef fective income tax rate for 2017 was (48.3)%  compared to 35.2%  for 2016. The decrease in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was due to a
one-time, non-cash income tax benefit recorded in the current period as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. The TCJA significantly revised the U.S.
federal corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21% beginn ing in 2018 and imposing a mandatory repatriation tax on
accumulated foreign earnings. U.S. GAAP accounting for income taxes requires that Verizon record the impacts of any tax law change on our deferred income taxes in the
quarter that the tax law change is enacted. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 allows us
to provide a provisional estimate of the impacts of the legislation. Verizon has provisionally estimated, based on currently available information, that the enactment of the
TCJA results in a one-time reduction in net deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $16.8 billion , primarily due to the re-me asurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities at
the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, and no impact from the repatriation tax. This provisional estimate does not reflect the ef fects of any state tax law changes
that may arise as a result of federal tax reform. Verizon will continue to analyze the effects of the TCJA on its financial statements and operations and include any adjustments
to tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the reporting periods that such adjustments are determined, consistent with the one-year measurement period set forth in
SAB 1 18.
The effective income tax rate for 2016 was 35.2%  compared to 34.9%  for 2015. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of $527 million
included in the provision for income taxes from goodwill not deductible for tax purposes in connection with the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016. This increase was partially
offset by the impact that lower income before income taxes in the current period has on each of the reconci ling items specified in the table above. The decrease in the provision
for income taxes was prim arily due to lower income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded 2016 in compared to severance, pension and
benefit credits recorded in 2015.
The amounts of cash taxes paid by V erizon are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31, 2017  2016  2015
Income taxes, net of amounts refunded $ 4,432  $ 9,577  $ 5,293
Employment taxes 1,207  1,196  1,284
Property and other taxes 1,737  1,796  1,868
Total $ 7,376  $ 12,569  $ 8,445
The increase in cash taxes paid during 2016 compared to 2015 was due to a $3.2 billion  increase in income taxes paid primarily as a result of the Access Line Sale.
Deferred taxes arise because of dif ferences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
 (dollars in millions)  
At December 31, 2017  2016
Employee benefits $ 6,174  $ 10,453
Tax loss and credit carry forwards 4,176  3,318
Other - assets 1,938  2,632
 12,288  16,403
Valuation allowances (3,293 ) (2,473 )
Deferred tax assets 8,995  13,930
    
Spectrum and other intangible amortization 21,148  31,404
Depreciation 14,767  22,848
Other - liabilities 4,281  5,642
Deferred tax liabilities 40,196  59,894
Net deferred tax liability $ 31,201  $ 45,964
The decrease in the net deferred tax liability during 2017 was primarily due to the $16.8 billion  re-measurement of U.S. deferred taxes at the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate
income tax rate.
At December 31, 2017 , undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States amounted to approximately $1.8 billion . Due to foreign
legal restrictions that requi re minimum reserves be maintained in certain countries, not all of the foreign undistributed earnings are available for repatriation. No U.S. federal
deferred income taxes on these undistributed earnings are required because, under the TCJA, such earning s have been subject to U.S. federal tax as a result of the mandatory
repatriation provision. In addition, such earnings will not be subject to U.S. federal tax when actually distri buted under the new 100% participation exemption as enacted under
the TCJA.
At December 31, 2017 , we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $4.2 billion  that primarily relate to state and foreign taxes.
Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $2.6 billion  will expire between 2018  and 2037 and approximately $1.6 billion  may be carried forward
indefinitely .
During 2017 , the valuation allowance increased approximately $0.8 billion . The balance of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2017  and the 2017  activity is primarily
related to state and foreign taxes.
Unrecognized T ax Benefits
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
   (dollars in millions)  
 2017  2016  2015
Balance at January 1, $ 1,902  $ 1,635  $ 1,823
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 219  338  194
Additions for tax positions of prior years 756  188  330
Reductions for tax positions of prior years (419) (153) (412)
Settlements (42) (18) (79)
Lapses of statutes of limitations (61) (88) (221)
Balance at December 31, $ 2,355  $ 1,902  $ 1,635
Included in the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 , 2016  and 2015  is $1.9 billion , $1.5 billion  and $1.2 billion , respectively , that if recognized, would
favorably af fect the ef fective income tax rate.
We recognized the following net after -tax (expenses) benefits related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes:
Years Ended December 31, (dollars in millions)
2017 $ (77)
2016 (25)
2015 43
The after -tax accruals for the payment of interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
At December 31, (dollars in millions)
2017 $ 269
2016 142
The increase in unrecognized tax benefits during 2017 was primarily related to the acquisition of Y ahoo's operating business.
Verizon and/or its subsidia ries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer , we are under audit
by the Interna l Revenue Service (IRS) and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years. The IRS is currently examining the Company’ s U.S. income tax
returns for tax years 2013-2014 and Cellco Partnersh ip’s U.S. income tax return for tax year 2013- 2014 . Tax controv ersies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2005. The
amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is
reasonably possible that various current tax examinations will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’ s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of
the possible change cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved.

Segment Information
Reportable Segments
We have two report able segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services, and customer
groups, respectively . We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of
segment performance.
Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following:
Segment  Description
Wireless Wireless’ communications  products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer , business and
government customers across the U.S.
Wireline Wireline’ s voice, data and video comm unications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data services, corporate networking solutions,
security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well
as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the U.S. and around the world.
During the first quarter of 2017, Verizon reorganized  the customer groups within its Wireline segment. Previously , the customer groups in the Wireline segment consisted of
Mass Markets  (which included Consumer Retail and Small Business subgroups), Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale. Pursuant to the reorganization, there are now four
customer groups within the Wireline segment: Consumer Markets, which includes the customers previousl y included in Consumer Retail; Enterprise Solutions, which includes
the large business custom ers, including multinational corporations, and federal government customers previously included in Global Enterprise; Partner Solutions, which
includes the customers previously included in Global Wholesale; and Business Markets, a new customer group, which includes U.S.-based small business customers previously
included in Mass Markets  and U.S.-based medium business customers, state and local government customers and educational institutions previously included in Global
Enterprise.
Corporate and other includ es the results of our Media business, branded Oath, our telematics and other  businesses, investments in unconsolidated businesses, unallocated
corporate expenses, pension and other employee benefit related costs and lease financing. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and
other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business
segment resul ts, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses that are not individu ally significant are included in all segment results as these items are
included in the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.  We completed our acquisition of Y ahoo's operating business on June 13, 2017.
On April 1, 2016, we completed the Access Line Sale. Additionally , on May 1, 2017, we completed the Data Center Sale. See Note 2 for additional information. The results of
operations for these divestitures and other insignificant transactions are included within Corporate and other for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating
results consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker .
In addition, Corporate and other includes the results of our telematics businesses for all periods presented, which were reclassified from our Wireline segment effective April 1,
2016. The impact of this reclassification was insignificant to our consolidated financial statements and our segment results of operations.
The reconciliation of segment operating revenues and expenses to consolidated operating revenues and expenses below includes the effects of special items that management
does not consider in assessing segment performance, primarily because of their nature.
We have adjusted prior period consolidated and segment information, where applicable, to conform to the current year presentation.

On March 3, 2017, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a new share buyback program to repurchase  up to 100 million  shares of the company's common stock. The new
program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches  100 million , or at the close  of business on February 28, 2020, whichever is sooner . During the
years ended December 31, 2017  and 2016 , Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’ s common stock under our authorized share buyback programs. During the year
ended December 31, 2015 , Verizon repurchased approximately 2.8 million  shares of the Company's common stock under our previous share buyback program for
approximately $0.1 billion . At December 31, 2017 , the maximum  number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyb ack program was
100 million .
In addition to the previously authorized three -year share buyback program, in 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an accelerated share
repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion  of the Company's common stock. On February 10, 2015, in exchange for an up-front payment totaling $5.0 billion ,
Verizon received an initial delivery of 86.2 million  shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion . On June 5, 2015, Verizon received an additional 15.4 million  shares as
final settlement of the transaction under the ASR agreement. In total, 101.6 million  shares were delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $49.21 .
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareowner plans. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we
issued 2.8 million  common shares from Treasury stock, which had an insignificant aggregate value. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we issued 3.5 million  common
shares from Treasury stock, which had an insignific ant aggregate value. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we issued 22.6 million  common shares from Treasury
stock, which had an aggregate value of $0.9 billion .
Note 15
Commitments and Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involv ed in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal level. Where it is determined, in
consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter , the Company establishes an accrual. In none of the
currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be
made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including (1) uncertain damage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record;
(3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously
monitor these  proceedings as they develop and adjus t any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending regulatory or legal
matter in future periods, including the Hicksville matter described below , will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a material effect on our results
of operations for a given reporting period.
Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to
address contamination at the site of a former Sylvani a facility in Hicksville NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army
Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the
contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the
parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation.
Verizon is currently involved in approximately 40 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. Most of these cases are brought by non-
practicing entities and effectively seek only monetar y damages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well.
These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved.
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers
pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time,
counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and V erizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business.
Subsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was issued when the directory
business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensio ns). The preexisting guara ntee continues, without modification, despite the subsequent sale of Verizon
Information Services Canada and the spin-of f of our domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories business. The possible financial impact of the guarantee, which is not
expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably estimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may
offset each other . We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely .
As of December 31, 2017 , letters of credit totaling approximately $0.6 billion , which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing
arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.
We have several commitments, totaling $21.0 billion , primarily to purchase programming and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be
used or sold in the ordinary  course of business, from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $7.6 billion  is attributable to 2018 , $9.0 billion  is attributable to 2019  through
2020 , $2.1 billion  is attributable to 2021  through 2022  and $2.3 billion  is attributable to years thereafter . These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the
future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities or
termination amounts. Purchases against our commitments totaled approximately $8.2 billion  for 2017 , $8.1 billion  for 2016 , and $10.2 billion  for 2015 . Since the commitments
to purchase programming services from television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of
subscribers at December 31, 2017 , and applica ble rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm
commitment.
