FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report contains information that may constitute “forward-looking statements.” Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,”
“will” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions
does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the
future — including statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and net income per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future operating
results — are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not
to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-
looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our Company’s actual results to differ materially from historical experience and our present
expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the assumptions used to calculate our estimated aggregate
incremental tax and interest liability related to the potential unfavorable outcome of the ongoing tax dispute with the United States Internal Revenue Service could significantly
change; those described in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report; and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
Part I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
In this report, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial
statements.
General
The Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200
countries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;
water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world’s top six nonalcoholic
sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light.
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and
retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company account for 2.2 billion of the
estimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.
We believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.
Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.
We are guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference. Our vision for growth has three connected pillars:
•Loved Brands. We craft meaningful brands and a choice of drinks that people love and enjoy and that refresh them in body and spirit.
•Done Sustainably. We grow our business in ways that achieve positive change in the world and build a more sustainable future for our planet.
•For A Better Shared Future. We invest to improve people’s lives, from our employees to all those who touch our business system, to our investors, to the broad
communities we call home.
The Coca-Cola Company was incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same
name that had been organized in 1892.

Operating Segments
The Company’s operating structure is the basis for our internal financial reporting. Our operating structure includes the following operating segments:
•Europe, Middle East and Africa
•Latin America
•North America
•Asia Pacific
•Global Ventures
•Bottling Investments
Additionally, our operating structure includes operating units, which sit under our four geographic operating segments. The operating units are focused on regional and local
execution and are highly interconnected, with the goal of eliminating duplication of resources and scaling new products more quickly. The operating units work closely with
five global marketing category leadership teams to rapidly scale ideas while staying close to the consumer. The global marketing category leadership teams primarily focus on
innovation as well as marketing efficiency and effectiveness.
Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of two components: (1) a center focusing on strategic initiatives, policy, governance and scaling global
initiatives, and (2) a platform services organization supporting the operating units, global marketing category leadership teams and the center by providing efficient and scaled
global services and capabilities, including, but not limited to, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and social/digital hubs.
For additional information about our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, “Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.
Except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, the description of our business in this report
is presented on a consolidated basis.
Products and Brands
As used in this report:
•“concentrates” means flavorings and other ingredients which, when combined with water and, depending on the product, sweeteners (nutritive or non-nutritive) are used
to prepare syrups or finished beverages, and includes powders/minerals for purified water products;
•“syrups” means intermediate products in the beverage manufacturing process produced by combining concentrates with water and, depending on the product, sweeteners
(nutritive or non-nutritive);
•“fountain syrups” means syrups that are sold to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and convenience stores, which use dispensing equipment to mix the syrups with
sparkling or still water at the time of purchase to produce finished beverages that are served in cups or glasses for immediate consumption;
•“Company Trademark Beverages” means beverages bearing our trademarks and certain other beverages bearing trademarks licensed to us by third parties for which we
provide marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit; and
•“Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages” or “Trademark Coca-Cola” means nonalcoholic beverages bearing the trademark Coca-Cola or any trademark that includes Coca-
Cola or Coke (that is, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and all their variations and any line extensions, including caffeine free Diet
Coke, Cherry Coke, etc.). Likewise, when we use the capitalized word “Trademark” together with the name of one of our other beverage products (such as “Trademark
Fanta,” “Trademark Sprite” or “Trademark Simply”), we mean beverages bearing the indicated trademark (that is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its
variations and line extensions (such that “Trademark Fanta” includes Fanta Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Zero Sugar, Fanta Apple, etc.; “Trademark Sprite”
includes Sprite, Sprite Zero Sugar, etc.; and “Trademark Simply” includes Simply Orange, Simply Apple, Simply Grapefruit, etc.).
3
Our Company markets, manufactures and sells:
•beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate
operations”); and
•finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations”).
Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.
Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which
we typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the
product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and
refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through
wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which
they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain
syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.
Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and
wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our
Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to
distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments
or our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited (“Costa”). These sales are included in our
Global Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages
for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are
included in our North America operating segment.
For information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading “Our
Business — General” set forth in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report.
For information regarding how we measure the volume of Company beverage products sold by the Company and our bottling partners (“Coca-Cola system”), refer to the
heading “Operations Review — Beverage Volume” set forth in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of
this report.
We own and market numerous valuable beverage brands, including the following:
•sparkling soft drinks: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes, Sprite and Thums Up;
•water, sports, coffee and tea: Aquarius, Ayataka, BODYARMOR, Ciel, Costa, Dasani, doğadan, FUZE TEA, Georgia, glacéau smartwater, glacéau vitaminwater, Gold
Peak, Ice Dew, I LOHAS, Powerade and Topo Chico; and
•juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages: AdeS, Del Valle, fairlife, innocent, Minute Maid, Minute Maid Pulpy and Simply.
Schweppes is owned by the Company in certain countries other than the United States.
In addition to the beverage brands we own, we also provide marketing support and otherwise participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures
and strategic relationships. For example, certain Coca-Cola system bottlers distribute certain brands of Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), primarily Monster Energy,
in designated territories in the United States, Canada and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster and
related distribution agreements between Monster and Coca-Cola system bottlers.
Consumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings. Consumer demand can vary from one market to another and can change over time within a
single market. Our Company continually seeks to further optimize its portfolio of brands, products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand in every market.1

Distribution System
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries and territories through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors,
wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing trademarks owned by or licensed
to the Company at a rate of 2.2 billion servings each day. Our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us capture growth by manufacturing, distributing and
selling existing, enhanced and new innovative products to consumers throughout the world.
The Coca-Cola system sold 32.7 billion and 31.3 billion unit cases of our products in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sparkling soft drinks represented 69 percent of our
worldwide unit case volume in both 2022 and 2021. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 46 percent and 47 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in 2022 and 2021,
respectively. In 2022, unit case volume in the United States represented 17 percent of the Company’s worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume, 61 percent was
attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83
percent of the Company’s worldwide unit case volume in 2022. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China,
Brazil and India, which together accounted for 32 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 70 percent was attributable to sparkling soft
drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 47 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.
Our five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2022 were as follows:
•Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Coca-Cola FEMSA”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including
Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (most of the country), Colombia (most of the country), Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela,
Uruguay, Brazil (a major part of the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais; the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná and Santa Catarina; and part of the states of Rio
Grande do Sul, Goiás and Rio de Janeiro), and Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas);
•Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc (“CCEP”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great
Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;
•Coca-Cola HBC AG (“Coca-Cola Hellenic”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland,
Republic of Ireland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;
•Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of
Texas and part of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and
•Swire Coca-Cola Limited, which as of December 31, 2022 had bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai municipality in mainland China,
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Cambodia and territories in 13 states in the western United States. Swire Coca-Cola Limited acquired our bottling and distribution operations in
Vietnam in January 2023.
In 2022, these five bottling partners combined represented 42 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.
Being a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.
Bottler’s Agreements
We have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as “bottler’s agreements,” with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations
by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler’s agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company
Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire
requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain
from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the
particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for us or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such
containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or
form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).
5
While under most of our bottler’s agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our
bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company’s ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject,
both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through
shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based
concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing,
the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.
As further discussed below, our bottler’s agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler’s agreements for territories within the
United States.
Bottler’s Agreements Outside the United States
Bottler’s agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the United States generally are of stated duration, subject in some cases to possible extensions or renewals.
Generally, these bottler’s agreements are subject to termination by the Company following the occurrence of certain designated events, including defined events of default and
certain changes in ownership or control of the bottlers. Most of the bottler’s agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the United States authorize the bottlers to
manufacture and distribute fountain syrups, usually on a nonexclusive basis.
In certain parts of the world outside the United States, we have not granted comprehensive beverage production and distribution rights to the bottlers. In such instances, we
have authorized certain bottlers to (1) prepare and package Company Trademark Beverages for sale to other bottlers or (2) purchase Company Trademark Beverages from other
bottlers for sale and distribution throughout their respective designated territories, often on a nonexclusive basis.
Bottler’s Agreements Within the United States
In the United States, most bottlers operate under a contract to which we generally refer as a “Comprehensive Beverage Agreement” (“CBA”) that is of stated duration, subject
in most cases to renewal rights of bottlers and in some cases to renewal rights of the Company. A small number of bottlers continue to operate under legacy bottler’s agreements
with no stated expiration date for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. In all instances, the bottler’s agreements in the
United States are subject to termination by the Company for nonperformance or upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to
contract.
Certain U.S. bottlers have been granted certain additional exclusive territory rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of Company-owned and licensed
beverage brands (as defined by the CBAs). We refer to these bottlers as “expanding participating bottlers” or “EPBs.” EPBs operate under CBAs (“EPB CBAs”) under which
the Company generally retained the rights to produce the applicable beverage products for territories not covered by specific manufacturing agreements, and such bottlers
purchase from the Company (or from Company-authorized manufacturing bottlers) substantially all of the finished beverage products needed in order to service the customers
in these territories. Each EPB CBA has a term of 10 years and is renewable, in most cases by the bottler, and in some cases by the Company, indefinitely for successive
additional terms of 10 years each and includes additional requirements that provide for, among other things, a binding national governance model, mandatory incidence pricing
and certain core performance requirements. The Company has also entered into manufacturing agreements that authorize certain EPBs that have executed EPB CBAs to
manufacture certain beverage products for their own account and for supply to other bottlers.
In addition, certain U.S. bottlers that were not granted additional exclusive territory rights, which we refer to as “participating bottlers,” converted their legacy bottler’s
agreements to CBAs, to which we refer as “participating bottler CBAs,” each of which has a term of 10 years, is renewable by the bottler indefinitely for successive additional
terms of 10 years each, and is substantially similar in most material respects to the EPB CBAs, including with respect to requirements for a binding national governance model
and mandatory incidence pricing, but includes core performance requirements that vary in certain respects from those in the EPB CBAs.
Those bottlers that have not signed CBAs continue to operate under legacy bottler’s agreements that include pricing formulas that generally provide for a baseline price for
Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company, up to a maximum
indexed ceiling price, and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. The U.S. unit case volume prepared, packaged, sold and
distributed under these legacy bottler’s agreements is not material.
Under the terms of the bottler’s agreements, bottlers in the United States generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups. Rather, the Company manufactures and
sells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain authorized bottlers) and some fountain retailers. These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups, or deliver
them on our behalf, to restaurants and other retailers.
6
Promotional and Marketing Programs
In addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most
cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler’s
agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and
equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to
fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements. The aggregate amount provided by our Company to bottlers, resellers and other customers of our
Company’s products, principally for participation in promotional and marketing programs, was $4.8 billion in 2022.
Investments in Bottling Operations
Most of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of
a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables
us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler’s sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler’s business and information systems;
and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our
ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-
Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company
continues to participate in the bottler’s results of operations through our share of the equity method investee’s earnings or losses.
In addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and
efficiency of the Coca-Cola system’s production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those
businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased
sales for our Company’s concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler’s operating
and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.
Seasonality
Sales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of
sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.
Competition
The commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include
companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products
include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and
powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and
relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The
Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has authorized alcohol-licensed
third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. Competitive products include all
flavored alcohol beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant
competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestlé S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage & Food Limited, Unilever, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings,
Heineken N.V., Diageo and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing
microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers
that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.
Competitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing,
digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing
equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.
Our competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products;
sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated employees. Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many
countries, a concentrated
7
retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers’ own store or private-
label beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.
Raw Materials
We and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business, including high fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”), sucrose, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose,
saccharin, cyclamate, steviol glycosides, ascorbic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid, caffeine and caramel color; other raw materials such as coffee, orange and other fruit juice
and juice concentrates; packaging materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”), bio-based PET and recycled PET for bottles; and aluminum cans, glass bottles and
other containers.
Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural
resource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we
operate, as one of the key challenges facing our business.
In addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, the principal nutritive sweetener is HFCS,
which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. HFCS is available from numerous domestic sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. Adverse
weather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. For example, drought conditions in certain parts
of the United States or in other major corn-producing areas of the world may negatively affect the supply of corn, which in turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for
HFCS. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States is sucrose (i.e., table sugar), which is also available from numerous sources and has
historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for nutritive sweeteners. In
the United States, we purchase HFCS to meet our and our bottlers’ requirements with the assistance of Coca-Cola Bottlers’ Sales & Services Company LLC (“CCBSS”).
CCBSS is a limited liability company that is owned by authorized Coca-Cola bottlers doing business in the United States. Among other things, CCBSS provides procurement
services to our North American operations and to our U.S. bottling partners for the purchase of various goods and services, including HFCS.
The principal non-nutritive sweeteners we use in our business are aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate and steviol glycosides. Generally, these
raw materials are readily available from numerous sources. We purchase sucralose, which we consider a critical raw material, from suppliers in the United States and China.
Our Company generally has not experienced major difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non-nutritive sweeteners.
Juice and juice concentrate from various fruits, particularly orange juice and orange juice concentrate, are the principal raw materials for our juice and juice drink products. We
source our orange juice and orange juice concentrate primarily from Florida and the Southern Hemisphere (particularly Brazil). We work closely with Cutrale Citrus Juices
U.S.A., Inc., our primary supplier of orange juice from Florida and Brazil, to ensure an adequate supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate that meets our Company’s
standards. However, the citrus industry is impacted by citrus greening disease and the variability of weather conditions that can affect the quality and supply of orange juice and
orange juice concentrate. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate
throughout the industry. In addition, citrus greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs and prices.
We generate most of our coffee revenues through Costa. Costa purchases Rainforest Alliance Certified and other green coffee through multiple suppliers. While most of Costa’s
coffee is sourced as readily available bulked commercial grade from Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia, many of Costa’s suppliers have vertically integrated supply chains with
direct access to yields from cooperatives and producer groups.
Our consolidated bottling operations and our non-bottling finished product operations also purchase various other raw materials, including, but not limited to, PET resin,
preforms and bottles; glass and aluminum bottles; aluminum and steel cans; plastic closures; aseptic fiber packaging; labels; cartons; cases; postmix packaging; and beverage
gases, including carbon dioxide and liquid nitrogen. While we generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not experienced significant
shortages, certain packaging materials, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers.
Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
Our Company owns numerous patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other know-how and technology, which we collectively refer to in this report as “technology.” This
technology generally relates to beverage products and the processes for their production; packages and packaging materials; design and operation of processes and equipment
useful for our business; and
8
certain software. Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties. Trade secrets are an important aspect of our technology, and our sparkling beverage and
other beverage formulas are among the important trade secrets of our Company.
We also own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their
registrations are properly maintained. Pursuant to our bottler’s agreements, we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their
preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of Company products. In addition, we authorize certain third parties to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with
their preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of beverages bearing Company trademarks in certain territories. We also grant licenses to third parties from time to time to
use certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and food products.
Governmental Regulation
Our Company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business. In
many jurisdictions, our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.
In the United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and sale of our Company’s products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; various federal and state laws and regulations governing
competition and trade practices, including the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, as amended, and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended; federal, state and local workplace
health and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; privacy and personal data protection laws; and various other federal, state and local
statutes and regulations. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements and
regulatory reviews.
Under the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Proposition 65”) of the state of California, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or
harms human reproduction or development, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the conditions of an
exemption (described below) can be met. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. The detection of even a trace amount
of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 exempts a product from a warning if the manufacturer can
demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:
•below a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established;
•naturally occurring;
•the result of necessary cooking; or
•subject to another applicable exemption.
One or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 list can be detected in certain Company products at low levels that are safe. The Company maintains that the
presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with
Proposition 65. However, the state of California and other parties have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future. Additionally, the state of California may
include other substances on the Proposition 65 list in the future.
Bottlers of our beverage products presently offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around
the world. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and
elsewhere around the world requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. The
precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes, product stewardship
and/or restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including certain packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), also apply in various
jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere around the world. We anticipate that additional such legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at federal,
state and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world.
All of our Company’s facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and
regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources, discharge of wastewater and air emissions. In addition, increasing concern over climate change is expected to
continue to result in additional legal or regulatory requirements (both inside and outside the United States) designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, to discourage the use of plastic materials, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity
concerns, or to expand disclosure of certain sustainability metrics. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. We have made, and plan on continuing to make,
expenditures
9
necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals. While compliance has not had a
material adverse effect on our Company’s capital expenditures, net income or competitive position, changes in environmental compliance requirements along with expenditures
necessary to comply with such requirements and to make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals could adversely affect our financial performance.
We are also subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, including the European Union’s General
Data Protection Regulation, China’s Personal Information Protection Law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020, as
amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective on January 1, 2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which became effective on January 1,
2023, and privacy laws in Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, which are slated to take effect during 2023. The interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and data
residency laws are often uncertain and are expanding in the United States and internationally, including in the European Union, Brazil, China and other jurisdictions. We
monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain their relevance to and potential impact on our business, and we develop strategies to address
regulatory trends and developments, including any required changes to our privacy and data protection compliance programs and policies. Globally, we see a trend toward data
protection laws and regulations increasing in complexity and number, and we anticipate that our obligations will expand commensurately. As a result, our ability to maximize
the utility of our data could be impacted and we may need to modify our practices to accommodate legal and regulatory constraints and obligations or meet consumer
expectations.
Human Capital Management
Our people and culture agendas are critical business priorities. Our Board of Directors, through the Talent and Compensation Committee, provides oversight of the Company’s
policies and strategies relating to talent; leadership and culture, including diversity, equity and inclusion; and the Company’s compensation philosophy and programs. The
Talent and Compensation Committee also evaluates and approves the Company’s compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives. In addition,
the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance of our Board of Directors oversees succession planning and talent development for our senior executives.
Employees
We believe people are our most important asset, and we strive to attract and retain high-performing talent. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our Company had approximately
82,500 and 79,000 employees, respectively, of which approximately 9,000 and 9,400, respectively, were located in the United States. The increase in the total number of
employees was primarily due to Costa opening new retail stores as well as the existing Costa retail stores requiring additional staff to meet increased demand, partially offset by
the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in Cambodia. Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 600 employees in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically have terms of three
to five years. We currently anticipate that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such agreements when they expire.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that mirrors the markets we serve is critical to the Company’s continued growth and success. We take a
comprehensive view of diversity, equity and inclusion across different races, ethnicities, tribes, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, generations, abilities, and expressions of
gender and sexual identity.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 7,800 employees located in the United States, excluding the employees of the Global Ventures operating segment; fairlife,
LLC; and BA Sports Nutrition, LLC. Of these 7,800 employees, 40 percent and 48 percent were female and people of color, respectively.
We seek to create a better shared future for everyone our brands and business touch. We are focused on providing access to equal opportunity and fostering belonging both in
our workplaces and the local communities we proudly serve. We have publicly announced our 2030 aspirations to be 50 percent led by women globally, and in the United
States, to reflect the U.S. Census racial and ethnic representation at all job grade levels. Each of our operating units outside the United States has developed locally relevant
diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations. Diversity and inclusion metrics, which highlight progress and help drive accountability, are shared with our senior leaders on a
quarterly basis. Our Global Women’s Leadership Council, composed of ten senior leaders, focuses on accelerating the development and promotion of women into roles of
increasing responsibility and influence.
We believe our sustainability goals, including our diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations, are key drivers for growth. Accordingly, in 2022, we introduced quantitative and
qualitative components into our compensation programs for our executives to promote progress toward our diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations, as well as to encourage
the design and implementation of sustainable diversity, equity and inclusion strategies and programs that foster the recruitment, development and retention of diverse talent.
10
We conduct annual pay equity analyses, with regard to gender globally and race/ethnicity in the United States, to help ensure our base pay structures are fair and to identify and
address potential issues or disparities. When appropriate, we adjust base pay. Also, as permitted by local law, during the annual rewards cycle, we perform an adverse impact
analysis on base pay, annual incentives and long-term incentives to help ensure fairness.
We support many employee-led inclusion networks, which are an integral part of operationalizing and embedding our diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. Our inclusion
networks are regionally structured to meet relevant local needs, and they provide employees with the opportunity to engage with colleagues around the world based on common
interests or backgrounds.
Talent and Development
Through our comprehensive global talent management processes, we continuously identify and develop our talent for acceleration in our networked organization. We believe in
providing challenging and diverse experiences and opportunities to our people to help them develop and grow.
In 2022, we launched a global career strategy program called “Thrive,” which is designed to provide clarity to employees on what it means to have a career at the Company.
Through our people-centered approach, we strive to create an integrated, streamlined and inspiring career experience. We believe that development is anchored in acquiring
skills and work experiences. We focus on investing in inspirational leadership, capability development, and providing learning opportunities to equip our global workforce with
the skills they need for the future and to improve employee engagement and retention. We provide a range of formal and informal learning programs, which are designed to
help our employees continuously grow and strengthen their skills throughout their careers. We provide online learning through a robust catalog of digital content as well as
experiential learning opportunities, and we are continually identifying opportunities to provide democratized access to content for all of our employees. We also have Thrive
Opportunity Marketplace, a people-centered technology solution that helps connect project opportunities to interested employees who have the capacity, skills and interest in
short-term experiences and assignments. Additionally, we offer comprehensive Company-wide coaching and mentoring programs that support leadership and employee
development at all levels in our organization.
We also believe that talent thrives in a growth-oriented environment where high performance and leadership effectiveness are valued. Our talent practices rely on data and
feedback from multiple sources to help our employees get the transparent and timely feedback they need to be successful.
Compensation and Benefits
Through comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, ongoing employee learning and development, and a focus on health and well-being, we strive to support
our employees in all aspects of their lives. Our compensation programs are designed to reinforce our growth agenda and our talent strategy as well as to drive a strong
connection between the contributions of our employees and their pay.
We believe the structure of our compensation packages provides the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. We provide base pay that is
competitive and that aligns with employee positions, skill levels, experience and geographic location. In addition to base pay, we seek to reward employees with annual
incentive awards, recognition programs, and equity awards for employees at certain job levels.
We also offer competitive employee benefits packages, which vary by country and region. These employee benefits packages may include: 401(k) plan, pension plan, core and
supplemental life insurance, financial courses and advisors, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, commuter assistance, adoption assistance, medical and dental
insurance, vision insurance, health savings accounts, health reimbursement and flexible spending accounts, well-being rewards programs, vacation pay, holiday pay, and
parental and adoption leave.
Culture and Engagement
As our employees work together to achieve our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference, they collectively build and reinforce our culture. Our culture is rooted in our
growth mindset, which expects each employee, leader and function to be curious, empowered, inclusive and agile. We use a variety of practices to measure and support
progress against these growth behaviors and to ensure that our employees are engaged and fulfilled at work. For example, our Performance Enablement and Culture &
Engagement Pulse platforms provide regular opportunities for employees across the organization to provide feedback on how their leaders, teammates and work experiences
support the growth behaviors. Data from questionnaires are anonymized and plotted against historical results to inform teams and functions on areas of strength and
opportunities for improvement. We also encourage regular, live communication across the organization and host quarterly global town halls with our senior leadership that
include employee question-and-answer sessions. In addition, function-level town halls are held on a         regular basis.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently
deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS
Unfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results.
Our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, including inflation, credit market
conditions, increased unemployment, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity (including energy) prices and supply, a recession or economic slowdown, trade
policies, foreign currency exchange rates, changing policy positions or priorities, levels of government spending and deficits, and actual or anticipated default on sovereign
debt. Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced, and could continue to experience, unfavorable changes in economic conditions, which could
negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by
forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including private-label brands, which could
reduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall financial performance.
Other financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions or events in certain markets, including civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism or
governmental changes, or changes in international relations could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing power, thereby reducing demand
for our products. Product boycotts resulting from political activism could reduce demand for our products. Restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across
borders, price controls, limitations on profits, retaliatory tariffs, import authorization requirements and other restrictions on business activities, which have been or may be
imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability, deterioration of economic relations between countries or otherwise, could impact our profitability. In
addition, U.S. trade sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions for
commerce within such countries could increase significantly, which could make it difficult, or even impossible, for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries.
The imposition of retaliatory sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to U.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of our
branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to U.S. trade sanctions or other governmental actions or policies, could also negatively affect our business.
In March 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia. While we have maintained our operations in Ukraine to the extent possible, our business in
Ukraine has been disrupted due to the conflict. Although we currently do not anticipate that the suspension of our operations in Russia or the disruptions in Ukraine will have a
material impact on our results of operations, the conflict has resulted, and could continue to result, in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of
cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), reduced
availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and raw materials and other input costs, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or
regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia), or difficulty protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights. The ongoing conflict could
result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect
our employees, operations, customers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals.
12
Increased competition could hurt our business.
We operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. For additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, including the
names of certain of our significant competitors, refer to the heading “Competition” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of
sales in the global market or in regional or local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause the Company and our bottling
partners to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers’ ability to increase prices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost
increases. Such pressures may also increase marketing costs along with in-store placement, slotting and other marketing fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e ‑ commerce may
create additional consumer price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route-to-
market strategies and thus negatively affect revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand
loyalty and market share while strategically expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.
If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.
Achieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop,
introduce and market new beverage products. The success of our innovation activities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and
trends; obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property rights; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in our
innovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.
Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results.
Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines between, retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Retailers
may seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures in support of their businesses, and may be more likely
to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system’s profitability. In addition, in
developed markets, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace, while in emerging and developing markets, modern trade is growing at a faster pace than
traditional trade outlets. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and
subscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we and our bottling partners build e-commerce capabilities, we
may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key
customers operating physical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our
share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships
with key retail and foodservice customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.
If we are unable to expand our business in emerging and developing markets, our growth could be negatively affected.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those
markets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and
technology. Additionally, we rely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. Scarcity of, or heavy
competition for, talented employees could impede our abilities in such markets. Moreover, the supply of our products in emerging and developing markets must match
consumer demand for those products. Due to product price, limited purchasing power and cultural differences, our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or
developing market.
If we do not successfully manage the potential negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.
We believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement
the most effective and efficient business model possible. Consequently, we continuously search for productivity opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take
from time to time in pursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause
deterioration in employee morale, which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control
structures of the affected business operations; and give rise to negative publicity, which could affect our corporate reputation. If we are unable to successfully manage the
potential negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.
13
If we are unable to attract or retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, our business could be negatively affected.
The success of our business depends on our Company’s and the Coca-Cola system’s ability to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce
as well as on our success in nurturing a culture that supports our growth and aligns employees around the Company’s purpose and work that matters most. Competition for,
along with compensation and benefits expectations of, existing and prospective personnel have increased. In addition, the broader labor market is experiencing a shortage of
qualified workers, which has further increased the competition we face for qualified employees. We may not be able to successfully compete for, attract or retain the highly
skilled and diverse workforce that we want and that our future business needs may require, such as employees with e-commerce, social media and digital marketing and
advertising skills, and/or digital and analytics capabilities. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled
technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, the unexpected loss of experienced and highly skilled employees due to an increase
in aggressive recruiting for best-in-class talent could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and
retain highly skilled and diverse talent; to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture, including increasing the number of underrepresented employees
in the United States; to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for our management team; to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and
inclusion; or to design and successfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could disrupt our operations and
adversely affect our business and our future success.
Disruption of our supply chain, including increased commodity, raw material, packaging, energy, transportation and other input costs may adversely affect our financial
condition or results of operations.
We have experienced, and could continue to experience, disruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. In connection with our manufacturing and bottling
operations, we and our bottling partners are dependent upon, among other things, various ingredients and other raw materials and packaging materials. For additional
information on the raw materials and supplies we use in our business, refer to the heading “Raw Materials” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Some of the raw
materials and supplies used in the production of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal
demand is at its peak. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are located in countries experiencing political or other risks and/or unfavorable economic conditions. We and our
bottling partners may not be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers, and our contingency plans may not be effective in preventing
disruptions that may arise from shortages of any ingredients or other raw materials. In addition, adverse weather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities
from which key ingredients for our products are derived. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our
costs and interrupt product supply, which could adversely impact our business.
We and our independent bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute beverage products to customers. In addition, we and our independent
bottlers use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate production plants, bottling plants and distribution facilities. Throughout 2022,
increases in energy demand, along with supply disruptions exacerbated by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, resulted in significantly higher energy prices, particularly
in Europe, which could continue to impact us and our independent bottlers in the future.
The raw materials and other supplies, including ingredients, agricultural commodities, energy, fuel, packaging materials, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that
we use for the production and distribution of our products, are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors. These factors include changes
in supply and demand; supplier capacity constraints; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners’ relationships with suppliers; inflation; weather conditions (including the
effects of climate change); wildfires and other natural disasters; disease or pests (including the impact of citrus greening disease on the citrus industry); agricultural uncertainty;
health epidemics, pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including COVID-19); labor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; changes in or the enactment of new laws and
regulations; governmental actions or controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); port congestion or
delays; transport capacity constraints; cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions; political uncertainties; acts of terrorism; governmental instability; or fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We expect
the inflationary pressures on input and other costs to continue to impact our business in 2023.
Our attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through price increases of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in
sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forgo some
purchases altogether. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset higher costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in
sales volume, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset cost increases through productivity
initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.
14
The COVID-19 pandemic and related ongoing impacts may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus have negatively impacted, and
could continue to negatively impact, our business globally. The extent and nature of governmental actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have varied across our markets
based upon the then-current extent and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. At times we have experienced a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the
world, as well as a shift in consumer demand to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. While we have experienced improved trends throughout
2021 and 2022 in away-from-home channels and improved margins, our recovery has been asynchronous, and the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. If COVID-19 infection rates increase, the pandemic
intensifies, or continued efforts to curb the pandemic are ineffective, the negative impacts of the pandemic on our sales could be more prolonged and may become more severe
than what we have experienced to date.
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our global supply chain. We and our bottling partners have experienced temporary disruptions in certain
of our operations; delays in delivery of concentrates, ingredients, packaging and equipment; temporary plant closures; production slowdowns; and difficulty or delays in
sourcing key ingredients and beverage containers. We and our bottling partners may face similar disruptions in the future, which may increase supply chain and packaging
costs, or may result in an inability to secure key ingredients and inputs, which could cause delays in delivering our products to our customers and consumers. Although we are
unable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future, we expect supply chain pressures to continue into 2023.
In addition to the above risks, the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate other risks related to our business, including risks related to changes in the retail landscape or the loss
of key retail or foodservice customers; fluctuations in input costs, inflation rates, and foreign currency exchange rates; and the ability of third-party service providers and
business partners to fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. The continuing evolution
of the pandemic may also present risks not currently known to us.
If we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or if we are unable to realize a significant portion of the anticipated
benefits of our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results could suffer.
We routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or
taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. We may incur
unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring businesses, brands or bottling operations. The expected benefits of business or brand acquisitions, including
cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to
successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We may also
encounter unexpected difficulties, costs or delays in restructuring and integrating acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations into our Company’s operating, governance,
sustainability and internal control structures, including extending our Company’s internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses, which may increase the
risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our quality management program, which is designed
to ensure product quality and safety, may not be sufficiently robust to effectively manage the expanded range of product offerings introduced through newly acquired
businesses or brands, which may increase our costs or subject us to negative publicity. Also, we may not be able to successfully manage the additional complexities involved
with overseeing various supply chain models as we expand our product offerings. Our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage acquired
businesses, brands and bottling operations, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we
incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures,
or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.
We also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationships
with our joint venture partners or our strategic relationships, including our relationship with Monster, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of
the benefits we expect from our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
15
If our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.
In the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers,
distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain services in support of key portions of our operations. These third parties are
subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory and
market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in
accordance with the agreed-upon terms or applicable laws. In addition, while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our
relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems,
practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any
reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.
If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our
business could suffer.
Many of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to
renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory,
negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our
employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition,
many of our bottling partners’ employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or
at our bottling operations or our major bottlers’ plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers’ ability to supply
finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling
partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in
escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. If these labor relations are not effectively managed at the local level, they
could escalate in the form of corporate campaigns supported by the labor organizations and could negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in
turn could have a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers.
RISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS
Obesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.
There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. Increasing public concern
about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sweetened beverages; potential new or increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government
entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sweetened
beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of
sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.
If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.
Consumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns
regarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of, or
location of origin of, ingredients, raw materials or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically
valid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer
lifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources and the product manufacturing process; consumer emphasis on
transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other
materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets,
shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-
commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in
such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall
financial results could be negatively affected.
16
Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality
standards, which we expect our operations as well as our bottling partners to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling
partners periodically have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage
categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products. If we or our bottling partners fail to comply with
applicable product safety and quality standards, or if our beverage products taken to the market are or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to
conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our business to suffer.
Public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients, such as non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances,
and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products.
Public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as synthetic colors, non-nutritive sweeteners and
biotechnology-derived substances; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-
methylimidazole (“4-MEI”), a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or substances
used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (“BPA”), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the
coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers’ preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage products. In addition, increasing public concern
about perceived or potential health consequences of the presence of ingredients or substances in our beverage products or in packaging materials (or alleged presence of
substances such as PFAS) and/or the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain
ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have resulted, and could result, in additional governmental regulations concerning the
advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our beverages; potential new or increased taxes on our beverages by government entities; and negative publicity, or actual
or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry, all of which could damage the reputation of, and may reduce demand for, our beverage products.
If we are not successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our financial results could be negatively affected.
The digital evolution is affecting how we interact with consumers, customers, suppliers, bottlers and other business partners and stakeholders. We believe our future success
will depend in part on our ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment. Therefore, one of our top priorities is to digitalize the Coca-Cola system by, among other
things, creating more relevant and more personalized experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers, whether in a digital environment or through digital devices in
an otherwise physical environment; finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for the Coca-Cola system’s retail customers to enable them to grow their
businesses; and digitalizing operations through the use of data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. If we are
not successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our ability to increase sales and improve margins may be negatively affected and the cost and expenses we have
incurred or may incur in connection with our digitalization initiatives may adversely impact our financial performance.
If negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and human rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image,
corporate reputation and social license to operate, our business may suffer.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build the brand image for new products and brand extensions, and
maintain our corporate reputation and social license to operate. However, our continuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety
and quality and human rights have not always had, and may not in the future always have, the desired impact on our products’ brand image and on consumer preferences.
Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and
may cause consumers to choose other products. In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or “spurious” products, which we and our bottling partners
may not be able to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and our executives have engaged, and may in the
future engage, in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting
the Company. These engagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the future be, the subject of backlash from advocacy groups or others that have a differing
point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships have subjected us in the past, and
could subject us in the future, to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or
support financially or through in-kind contributions. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our bottling system or supply
17
chain, with workplace, human rights or animal welfare issues, whether actual or perceived, could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative
postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future,
generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Furthermore, allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting internationally
recognized human rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, including child labor laws,
or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers, joint venture partners or other business partners to engage in proper
animal welfare practices; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like
could negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers. In addition,
if we fail to respect our employees’ and our supply chain employees’ human rights, or inadvertently discriminate against any group of employees or hiring prospects, our ability
to hire and retain the best talent will be diminished, which could have an adverse impact on our overall business.
If we are unable to successfully manage new product launches, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
Due to the highly competitive nature of the commercial beverage industry, the Company continually introduces new products and evolves existing products to stimulate
consumer demand. For instance, the Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States, and in the United States, the
Company has authorized alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage
bases. The success of new and evolved products depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful product development, adherence to new global and/or local
standards of practice, consumer acceptance and stakeholder perception. Such endeavors may also involve significant risks and uncertainties, including greater execution risks;
higher costs; lower rates of sales; distraction of management from existing operations; lower product, category or industry knowledge and expertise; slower than expected or
inadequate return on investments; increased competitive pressures; stakeholder scrutiny; and reliance on the performance of third parties. As we become subject to additional
governmental regulations, including alcohol regulations related to licensing, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, and
relationships with distributors, we may become exposed to the risk of increased compliance costs and disruptions to our existing business.
RISKS RELATED TO THE COCA-COLA SYSTEM
We rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners, our business could
suffer.
We generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. As independent companies, our bottling
partners, some of which are publicly traded companies, make their own business decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, some of our bottling
partners have the right to manufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to maintain operating and strategic
alignment or agree on appropriate pricing and marketing and advertising support, or if our bottling partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and development efforts,
they may take actions that, while maximizing     their own short-term profits, may be detrimental to our Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their resources
        to business opportunities or products other than those of the Company. Such actions could, in the long term, have an adverse effect on our profitability.
If our bottling partners’ financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could be affected.
In the vast majority of our markets, our products are sold and distributed by independent bottling partners, and we therefore derive a significant portion of our net operating
revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. Accordingly, the success of our business depends in part on our bottling partners’ financial
strength and profitability. While under our agreements with our bottling partners we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our concentrates and
syrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners’ financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition,
we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such
bottling partners’ income or loss. Our bottling partners’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including
competitive and general market conditions; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; changes in or additional
regulations; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. A deterioration of
the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and
syrups; and, if such deterioration involves one or more of our
18
equity method investee bottling partners, it could also result in a decrease in our equity income and/or impairments of our equity method investments.
We may from time to time engage in refranchising activities or divestitures of certain brands or businesses, which could adversely affect our business and results of
operations.
As part of our strategic initiative to focus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, we continue to seek opportunities to refranchise
our consolidated bottling operations. Our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may be a distraction for, senior
management. If we are unable to complete future refranchising transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us, or if our refranchising partners are not efficient or not
aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have divested and may in the
future divest certain brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to
offset impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or if we are otherwise unable to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from
such divestitures.
RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERS
Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or regulations, or unfavorable resolutions of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial
results.
We are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable
local tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, tax treaties between such jurisdictions, and the geographic mix of our income before income taxes, which is itself
impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix or foreign currency exchange rates
could reduce our net income. Tax laws and regulations, including rates of taxation, are subject to revisions by individual taxing jurisdictions, and such revisions may result from
multilateral agreements. Many jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s
(“OECD”) anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a project on behalf of the G20 and other participating countries which would
grant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. Model rules adopted
pursuant to this project would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15 percent, and the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to
incorporate similar provisions into their respective domestic laws. The directive requires the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31,
2023. Other countries have taken similar actions. It is possible that the legislative adoption of these or other proposals could have a material impact on our net income and cash
flows. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable,
the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions, estimates and accruals. The results of
audits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and
for periods for which the statute of limitations is open.
For instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income for tax years 2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a
potential additional U.S. federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for that period, plus interest. The Company firmly believes that the IRS’ claims are without
merit and is pursuing, and will continue to pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its position. On November 18, 2020, the
U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) issued an opinion (“Opinion”) predominantly siding with the IRS. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the Opinion
and intends to vigorously defend its position, considering all avenues of appeal, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Company’s favor. It is therefore
possible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinion could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would be subject to significant additional liabilities
for the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years if the unfavorable portions of the Opinion were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope
of the Opinion. Moreover, the IRS could successfully appeal the portions of the Opinion that are favorable to the Company and/or assert new claims for additional tax relating
to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees. These adjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. Any such adjustments related to years prior to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may also have an impact on the
transition tax payable as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”). For additional information regarding the tax litigation, refer to Part I, “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” of this report.
Increased or new indirect taxes could negatively affect our business.
Our business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income, sometimes referred to as “indirect taxes,” including import duties, tariffs, excise
taxes, sales or value-added taxes, taxes on sweetened beverages, packaging taxes, carbon taxes, property taxes and payroll taxes, in many of the jurisdictions in which we
operate. In addition, in the past, the
19
U.S. Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar, HFCS or other nutritive sweeteners and may consider similar proposals in the
future. As federal, state and local governments in the United States and throughout the world experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers have singled out beverages
among a plethora of revenue-raising items and have imposed or increased, or proposed to impose or increase, sales or similar taxes on beverages, particularly sweetened
beverages and alcohol beverages, as well as packaging and/or packaging materials. Increases in or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or products
would increase the cost of products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable, which may negatively impact our net operating revenues
and profitability.
Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products.
We and our bottlers offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable containers in the United States and in various other markets around the world. Legal requirements
have been enacted in various jurisdictions requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage
containers. Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, recycling content, tethered bottle caps, ecotax and/or product stewardship, or prohibitions on
certain types of plastic products, packages and cups (including packaging containing PFAS) have been introduced and/or adopted in various jurisdictions, and we anticipate that
similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at federal, state and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers’ increased concerns and
changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the adoption of additional such legislation or regulations
in the future. If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could
reduce our net operating revenues and profitability.
Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products.
Various jurisdictions have adopted and may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products
because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current
or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.
For example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or
development, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor
level or another exemption is applicable. For additional information regarding Proposition 65, refer to the heading “Governmental Regulation” set forth in Part I, “Item 1.
Business” of this report. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our beverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting
consumer reaction to the warnings and potential adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets.
Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.
We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, those arising out of our advertising and
marketing practices, product claims and labels, competition, distribution and pricing, intellectual property and commercial disputes, tax disputes, and environmental and
employment matters. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of
potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These
assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or
losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates.
We conduct business in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments, which exposes us to increased legal and reputational risk.
We have bottling and other business operations in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our
employees and agents with all United States and local laws and regulations and consent orders applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper
payments to government officials. Nonetheless, our policies, procedures and related training programs may not always ensure full compliance by our employees and agents
with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in the United States and internationally or lead to litigation or
legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits.
20
Failure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights could harm our business.
Our trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights (refer to the heading “Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks” in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this
report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property
rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our
intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our
business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any
of the foregoing could harm our business.
Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating
revenues.
Our Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to
competition, distribution and pricing, product safety, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling, recycled content, product stewardship, the protection of the
environment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices, personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws
and regulations applicable to our business, refer to the heading “Governmental Regulation” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Changes in applicable laws or
regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where
our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital
expenditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition, increased
or additional regulations to limit and/or report carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic
materials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; or to limit or impose
additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, have in the past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures
and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our
products, which could affect our net operating revenues. Failure to comply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and competition laws; anti-modern
slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and China’s Personal Information
Protection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil
enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, the suspension of production or
distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners’ facilities, as
well as damage to our or our bottling partners’ image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners’ profitability.
RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2022, we derived $27.6 billion of net operating
revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and
expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the
value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.
Global events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the
resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be
offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing
countries, could materially affect our financial results.
If interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.
We maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our cost
of capital, which increases our return on shareowners’ equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative
financial instruments to reduce our

exposure to interest rate risks. However, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations.
On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”),
ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities,
will continue to be published through June 2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended, or will amend, our LIBOR-referencing agreements to
either reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate, but it is possible that these changes may have an adverse impact on
our financing costs as compared to LIBOR in the long term. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. In assessing our credit strength, credit rating
agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some credit
rating agencies also consider financial information of certain of our major bottling partners. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this
methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure; our major bottling partners’ financial performance; changes in the credit
rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength; the credit agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our or our major bottling partners’
current or future financial performance and financial condition; or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if the credit ratings of certain
bottling partners in which we have equity method investments were to be downgraded, such bottling partners’ interest expense could increase, which would reduce our equity
income.
If we are unable to achieve our overall long-term growth objectives, the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected.
We have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives. These objectives are based on, among other things, our evaluation of our growth prospects,
which are generally driven by the sales potential of our many beverage products, some of which are more profitable than others, and on an assessment of the potential price and
product mix. We may not be able to realize the sales potential and the price and product mix necessary to achieve our long-term growth objectives.
Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.
As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option
contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in
accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial
institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our
counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in
accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of
default by or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
We may be required to recognize impairment charges that could materially affect our financial results.
We assess our noncurrent assets, including trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity method investments and other long-lived assets, as and when required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to determine whether they are impaired and, if they are, we record appropriate impairment charges. Our equity
method investees also perform similar recoverability and impairment tests, and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by them adjusted, as
appropriate, for the impact of items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. It is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges
or our proportionate share of significant impairment charges recorded by equity method investees in the future and, if we do so, our net income could be materially adversely
affected.
RISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PRIVACY
If we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data or cybersecurity incidents, our operations could be disrupted, we
may suffer financial losses and our reputation may be damaged.
We rely on networks and information systems and other technology (“information systems”), including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of
business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, employee processes, consumer
marketing, mergers and acquisitions, and research and development. We use information systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting
purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. In addition, we depend on information systems for digital marketing activities and
electronic communications among our locations around the world and between Company employees and our bottlers, customers, suppliers, consumers and other third parties.
Because information systems are critical to many of the Company’s operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or
cybersecurity incidents. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine
22
operations, such as system upgrades, or by user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of
employees or contractors, cyberattacks by hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations (which may include social engineering, business email compromise, cyber
extortion, denial of service, or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities), geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other
catastrophic events. In addition, such cybersecurity incidents could result in unauthorized or accidental access to or disclosure of material confidential information or regulated
personal data. If our information systems or third-party information systems on which we rely suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans
do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our
inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments for concentrates or finished products. Unauthorized or accidental access to, or destruction, loss,
alteration, disclosure, falsification or unavailability of, information, or unauthorized access to machines and equipment could result in violations of data protection laws and
regulations, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment, damage to the reputation and credibility of the Company, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses
or brands, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net operating
revenues. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us, our current or former
employees, our bottling partners, other customers or suppliers, or consumers or other data subjects, and may become exposed to legal action and increased regulatory oversight,
including governmental investigations, enforcement actions and regulatory fines. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to
remedy the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or to repair or replace networks and information systems. These risks also may be present to the extent any of our
bottling partners, distributors, joint venture partners or suppliers using separate information systems, not integrated with the information systems of the Company, suffers a
cybersecurity incident and could result in increased costs related to involvement in investigations or notifications conducted by these third parties. These risks may also be
present to the extent a business we have acquired, but which does not use our information systems, experiences severe damage, a system shutdown, service disruption, or a
cybersecurity incident.
Like most major corporations, the Company’s information systems are a target of attacks. In addition, third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as our
bottling partners, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers or acquired businesses that use separate information systems, may experience cybersecurity incidents that may
involve data we share with them. Although the cybersecurity incidents that we have experienced to date, as well as those reported to us by our third-party partners, have not had
a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, such incidents could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. In order to address risks to
our information systems, we continue to make investments in personnel, technologies and training. Data protection laws and regulations around the world often require
“reasonable,” “appropriate” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation and application of those laws and regulations are often
uncertain and evolving; there can be no assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate, appropriate or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even
security measures that are deemed adequate, appropriate, reasonable or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not protect the information we maintain against
increasingly sophisticated attacks. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory corrective action due to a cybersecurity incident, which could adversely
affect our business operations and result in substantial costs for years to come. While we have purchased cybersecurity insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage
would be adequate in relation to any incurred losses. Moreover, as cyberattacks increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cybersecurity insurance in
amounts and on terms we view as appropriate for our operations.
If we fail to comply with privacy and data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity, business disruption, data loss, government enforcement actions and/or
private litigation, any of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.
In the ordinary course of our business, we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals (“personal data”), including employees, former
employees, vendors, third-party personnel, customers and consumers with whom we interact. As a result, we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing
laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy and data protection. These privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. In addition, new legislation in this area may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time.
These laws impose operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data, and many provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Some laws
and regulations also impose obligations regarding cross-border data transfers of personal data. These requirements with respect to personal data have subjected and may
continue in the future to subject the Company to, among other things, additional costs and expenses and have required and may in the future require costly changes to our
business practices and information technology and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. In addition, some countries are considering or have enacted data
localization or residency laws, which require that certain data be maintained, stored and/or processed within their country of origin. Maintaining local data centers in individual
countries could increase our operating costs significantly. Our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and
the policies,
23
procedures and practices we have implemented or may implement in the future may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal data by us or the third-party service
providers and vendors whose technology, systems and services we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of personal data. Unauthorized access to or
improper disclosure of personal data in violation of privacy and data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to regulatory
enforcement actions (including penalties, fines and investigations), and result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for
monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results. We have incurred, and will continue to incur,
expenses to comply with privacy and data protection standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of
data collection, use, disclosure and retention practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing laws and regulations, enactment of new laws and
regulations, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase our cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business or
otherwise harm our business.
RISKS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS
Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets is subject to risks, many of which are outside of our control, and our reputation and brands could be harmed if
we fail to meet such goals.
Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to sustainability, including practices and disclosures related to sustainable packaging;
water stewardship; climate; health and nutrition; human rights; and diversity, equity and inclusion. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets and to accurately
and transparently report our progress presents numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks, and is dependent on the actions of our bottling partners, suppliers and other
third parties, all of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to meet our sustainability goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, or if we are
perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for sustainability issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products, could be negatively
impacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on sustainability. If, as a result of their
assessment of our sustainability practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company.
As the nature, scope and complexity of sustainability reporting, due diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we may have to incur additional costs to control, assess and
report on sustainability metrics. Any failure or perceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our sustainability goals and targets or to satisfy various sustainability
reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk of litigation.
Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials could result in reduced demand for our beverage products and
increased production and distribution costs.
There are increasing concerns among consumers, governments and other stakeholders about the damaging impact of the accumulation of plastic bottles and other packaging
materials in the environment, particularly in the world’s waterways, lakes and oceans, as well as inefficient use of resources when packaging materials are not included in a
circular economy. We and our bottling partners sell certain of our beverage products in plastic bottles and use other packaging materials that, while largely recyclable, may not
be regularly recovered and recycled due to lack of collection and recycling infrastructure. If we and our bottling partners do not, or are perceived not to, act responsibly to
address plastic materials recoverability and recycling concerns and associated waste management issues, our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged, which
may cause some consumers to reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals
and targets to reduce the Coca-Cola system’s impact on the environment by, for example, increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials; increasing our use
of packaging materials that are made in part of plant-based renewable materials; expanding our use of reusable packaging (including refillable or returnable glass and plastic
bottles, as well as dispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers for our beverages); participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or
recover bottles and other packaging materials that are already in the environment; and taking other actions and participating in other programs and initiatives organized or
sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other groups. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our
announced environmental goals and targets, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our products. In addition, in response to
environmental concerns, governmental entities in the United States and in many other jurisdictions around the world have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations and
policies designed to mandate or encourage plastic packaging waste reduction and an increase in recycling rates and/or recycled content minimums, or, in some cases, restrict or
even prohibit the use of certain plastic containers or packaging materials. These regulations and policies, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our beverage
products or otherwise put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging materials waste has
in the past and may continue to require us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and to increase our capital expenditures. A reduction in consumer demand for our
products and/or an increase in costs and
24
expenditures relating to production and distribution as a result of these environmental concerns regarding plastic bottles and other packaging materials could have an adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.
Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system’s costs and capacity.
Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our
manufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve and the ecosystems in which we operate. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the
world, facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require
water, increasing pollution and emerging awareness of potential contaminants, poor management, lack of physical or financial access to water, sociopolitical tensions due to
lack of public infrastructure in certain areas of the world and the effects of climate change. As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water
becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints and the possibility of reputational
damage, which could adversely affect our profitability.
Increased demand for food products, decreased agricultural productivity and increased regulation of ingredient sourcing due diligence may negatively affect our business.
As part of the manufacture of our beverage products, we and our bottling partners use a number of key ingredients that are derived from agricultural commodities such as
sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea. Increased demand for food products; decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of
changing weather patterns; increased agricultural regulations, including regulation of ingredient sourcing due diligence; and other factors have in the past, and may in the
future, limit the availability and/or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. If we are unable to
implement programs focused on economic opportunity and environmental sustainability to address these agricultural challenges and fail to make a strategic impact on food
security through joint efforts with bottlers, farmers, communities, suppliers and key partners, as well as through our increased and continued investment in sustainable
agriculture, our ability to source raw materials for use in our manufacturing processes and the affordability of our products and ultimately our business and results of operations
could be negatively impacted.
Climate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere is causing significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Decreased agricultural
productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as
sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the world.
Climate change may also exacerbate extreme weather, resulting in water scarcity or flooding, and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could
limit water availability for the Coca-Cola system’s bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities,
disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Increasing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to
reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, and/or may result in increased disclosure obligations. Increased energy
or compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and
distribution of our beverage products. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our
business and results of operations. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to reduce the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint by
increasing our use of recycled packaging materials, expanding our renewable energy usage, and participating in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives
organized or sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other groups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions industrywide. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or
improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon footprint reduction goals and targets, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference
for our beverage products.
Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products.
The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months
may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
Our worldwide headquarters is located on a 35-acre complex in Atlanta, Georgia. The complex includes several office buildings which are used by Corporate employees and
North America operating segment employees. In addition, the complex includes technical and engineering facilities along with a reception center.
We own or lease additional facilities, real estate and office space throughout the world, which we use for administrative, manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage,
warehousing, distribution and retail operations. These properties are generally included in the geographic operating segment in which they are located, with the exception of our
Costa retail stores, which are included in the Global Ventures operating segment, and facilities related to our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are
included in the Bottling Investments operating segment.
The following table summarizes our principal production facilities, distribution and storage facilities, and retail stores by operating segment and Corporate as of December 31,

Management believes that our Company’s facilities used for the production of our products are suitable and adequate, that they are being appropriately utilized in line with past
experience, and that they have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes. The extent of utilization of our production facilities varies based upon seasonal
demand for our products. However, management believes that additional production can be achieved at the existing facilities by adding personnel and capital equipment or, at
some facilities, by adding shifts of personnel or expanding the facilities. We continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, on the basis of that review, may
from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. Management
believes that, except as disclosed in “U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute” below, the total liabilities of the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal
proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.
Aqua-Chem Litigation
On December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca-Cola Company v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., Civil Action No. 2002CV631-50) in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia (“Georgia Case”), seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company has no obligation to its former subsidiary, Aqua-Chem, Inc., now known as Cleaver-Brooks, Inc.
(“Aqua-Chem”), for any past, present or future liabilities or expenses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua-Chem. Subsequent to the Company’s filing but on
the same day, Aqua-Chem filed a lawsuit (Aqua-Chem, Inc. v. The Coca-Cola Company, Civil Action No. 02CV012179) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee
County, Wisconsin (“Wisconsin Case”). In the Wisconsin Case, Aqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not
covered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem’s general and product liability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Company’s sale of Aqua-Chem in
1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million for costs incurred by Aqua-Chem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case
initially was stayed, pending final resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua-Chem.
The Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance coverage, which also insures Aqua-Chem for
some of its prior and future costs for certain product liability and other claims. The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of
a stock sale agreement. The 1981 agreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties’ rights and obligations concerning past and future claims and
lawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a division of Aqua-Chem, manufactured boilers, some of
26
which contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has approximately 15,000 active claims
pending against it.
The parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-Chem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the
coverage action, five plaintiff insurance companies filed suit (Century Indemnity Company, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852)
in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the policies that were the
subject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination
of the respective rights and obligations under the insurance policies issued with regard to asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem. The action also sought a monetary
judgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers, one with a $15 million policy limit and one with a $25 million
policy limit, asserted cross-claims against the Company, alleging that the Company and/or its insurers are responsible for Aqua-Chem’s asbestos liabilities before any obligation
is triggered on the part of the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies.
Aqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the insurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were
jointly and severally liable for coverage amounts, but reserving judgment on other defenses that might apply. During the course of the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation,
Aqua-Chem and the Company reached settlements with several of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who paid funds into escrow accounts for payment of costs arising from the
asbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. On July 24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under
the insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant insurers, which judgment was not appealed. The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer whose policy
is triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua-Chem’s losses up to policy limits. The court’s judgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage
litigation.
The Company and Aqua-Chem continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem with those insurance companies that did
not settle in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. The Company anticipated that a final settlement with three of those insurers (“Chartis insurers”) would be finalized in
May 2011, but the Chartis insurers repudiated their settlement commitments and, as a result, Aqua-Chem and the Company filed suit against them in Wisconsin state court to
enforce the coverage-in-place settlement or, in the alternative, to obtain a declaratory judgment validating Aqua-Chem and the Company’s interpretation of the court’s judgment
in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.
In February 2012, the parties filed and argued a number of cross-motions for summary judgment related to the issues of the enforceability of the settlement agreement and the
exhaustion of policies underlying those of the Chartis insurers. The court granted defendants’ motions for summary judgment that the 2011 Settlement Agreement and 2010
Term Sheet were not binding contracts, but denied their similar motions related to plaintiffs’ claims for promissory and/or equitable estoppel. On or about May 15, 2012, the
parties entered into a mutually agreeable settlement/stipulation resolving two major issues: exhaustion of underlying coverage and control of defense. On or about January 10,
2013, the parties reached a settlement of the estoppel claims and all of the remaining coverage issues, with the exception of one disputed issue relating to the scope of the
Chartis insurers’ defense obligations in two policy years. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem on that one open issue and
entered a final appealable judgment to that effect following the parties’ settlement. On January 23, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a notice of appeal of the trial court’s summary
judgment ruling. On October 29, 2013, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem. On November 27,
2013, the Chartis insurers filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and on December 11, 2013, the Company filed its opposition to that petition. On April
16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin denied the Chartis insurers’ petition for review.
The Georgia Case remains subject to the stay agreed to in 2004.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute
On September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the IRS seeking approximately $3.3 billion of additional federal income tax
for years 2007 through 2009. In the Notice, the IRS stated its intent to reallocate over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from certain of its foreign affiliates that
the U.S. parent company licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in certain non-U.S. markets.
The Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates. IRS rules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-
length pricing of transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates.
To resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the IRS had agreed in 1996 on an arm’s-length methodology for determining
the amount of U.S. taxable income that the U.S. parent company would report as
27
compensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord in a closing agreement resolving that dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing
Agreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances or relevant federal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the
Company would not be assessed penalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation methodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be used for the 1987
through 1995 tax years.
The IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement methodology in five successive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through
2006.
The September 17, 2015 Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology for the 2007 through 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely
different methodology, without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax calculation methodology, the IRS reallocated over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent
company from its foreign licensees for tax years 2007 through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet to     do so.
The IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative
means for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly
imposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,
preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.
The Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the Tax Court in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice.
Prior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary
judgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.
The trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.
On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the
foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become
payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the
Company’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,
2013). The Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co.
opinion to the Company’s case, the Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a final decision, in the Company’s case.
The Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign
licensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different
from that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on
appeal and vigorously defend its position.
In determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting
Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and
regulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our various well-
founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal merits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not
the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the
methodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinion (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final resolution of the litigation. Based on
the required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result
of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the
different tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be
recharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis.
The Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of December 31, 2022. However,
we updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts
28
could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application of the required probability analysis to these updated calculations and the
accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax reserve as of December 31, 2022 to $423 million.
While the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment
proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax
years 2007 through 2009, and potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows.
The Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the
Opinion, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the
federal courts. This impact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2022 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and for subsequent tax years from
2010 through 2022. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments to the previously accrued transition tax payable under the Tax Reform Act.
The Company estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022. Additional income tax
and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. We currently project the continued application of the Tax
Court Methodology in future years, assuming similar facts and circumstances as of December 31, 2022, would result in an incremental annual tax liability that would increase
the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 3.5 percent.
The Company does not know when the Tax Court will issue its opinion regarding the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the Company’s licensee
in Brazil for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. After the Tax Court issues its opinion on the Company’s Brazilian licensee, the Company and the IRS will be provided time to
agree on the tax impact, if any, of both opinions, after which the Tax Court would render a final decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice
of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and pay the tax liability and interest related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years. The Company currently
estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax
and interest liability, would be approximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2022), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of
payment. Some or all of this amount would be refunded if the Company were to prevail on appeal.

The total shareowner return is based on a $100 investment on December 31, 2017 and assumes that dividends were reinvested on the day of issuance.
To better align with the Company’s direct competitors, the Company has chosen to change the peer group for the performance graph above. A self-constructed peer group
(“Prior Peer Group”), which consisted of the companies included in the Dow Jones Food & Beverage Index (from which the Company has been excluded) and the Dow Jones
Tobacco Index, was replaced with the Dow Jones Food & Beverage Total Return Index. Accordingly, the performance graph presents the total shareowner return for both the
Prior Peer Group and the Dow Jones Food & Beverage Total Return Index.
In 2022, the Prior Peer Group consisted of the following companies: Altria Group, Inc., Archer Daniels Midland Company, The Boston Beer Company, Inc., Brown-Forman
Corporation, Bunge Limited, Campbell Soup Company, Celsius Holdings, Inc., ConAgra Brands, Inc., Constellation Brands, Inc., Darling Ingredients Inc., Flowers Foods, Inc.,
General Mills, Inc., The Hershey Company, Hormel Foods Corporation, Ingredion Incorporated, Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Lamb

OUR BUSINESS
General
The Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200
countries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;
water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world’s top six nonalcoholic
sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light.
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and
retailers as well as the Company’s consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the
estimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.
We believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.
Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.
Our Company markets, manufactures and sells:
•beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate
operations”); and
•finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations”).
Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.
Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which
we typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the
product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and
refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through
wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the
33
United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing
beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations
are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.
Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and
wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our
Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to
distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments
or our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures
operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate
consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our
North America operating segment.
The following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:

Total 100 % 100 %
We operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along
with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic
conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 8, 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the conflict has caused
a disruption of our business in Ukraine. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve. As a point of reference, in 2021, the
Company’s business in Russia and Ukraine contributed 2 percent of the Company’s unit case volume and 1 percent and 2 percent of the Company’s consolidated net operating
revenues and operating income, respectively.
Throughout 2022, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resurgence of the virus in certain countries and the related actions by governments to attempt to contain
the spread of the virus, continued to negatively impact our business. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply
chain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we are focused on executing for growth.
Despite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support
our future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities:
unlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing
consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and
further embedding sustainability goals into our operations.

Challenges and Risks
Being a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain
challenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, five key challenges and risks are discussed below.
Obesity
Obesity continues to impact communities and countries worldwide. There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health
problems associated with obesity. This concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are
committed to being a part of the solution.
We recognize the uniqueness of consumers’ lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to:
•offer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;
•provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;
•provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and
•market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.
The heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering to find
winning solutions in the area of noncaloric sweeteners. This includes working to reduce sugar and calories in many of our beverages. We want to be a helpful and credible
partner in the fight against obesity. Across the Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action.
Evolving Consumer Product Preferences
We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of
these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. We are
committed to meeting changing consumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-
calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; innovative and sustainable packaging; and ingredient education
efforts.
Evolving Competitive Landscape and Competing in the Digital Marketplace
Our Company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local companies. Additionally, the rapidly evolving digital
landscape and growth of e-commerce in many markets has led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns. Consumers are rapidly embracing shopping via
mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, which presents new challenges to maintain the competitiveness and relevancy of our
brands. As a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to compete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market
share. In addition, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online
sales, and shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital.
Product Safety and Quality
We strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain
ingredients used in our products. The Coca-Cola system works every day to produce high quality, safe and refreshing beverages for consumers around the world. We have
rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage
options to satisfy consumers’ evolving needs and preferences.
We work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. We stay current with new regulations,
industry best practices and marketplace conditions, and we engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products
according to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-
Cola system against the same stringent standards. Our quality management program also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality laboratories, we
stringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace.
35
We perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries and territories where our products are
sold. We regularly assess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain.
Sustainability Matters
As investors and stakeholders increasingly focus on sustainability matters, our Company and companies across all industries are facing challenges and risks related to, among
other things, sustainable packaging; water stewardship; climate; health and nutrition; human rights; and diversity, equity and inclusion. Where these challenges and risks relate
to our business, we acknowledge that we have a role to play in developing and implementing solutions related to these important challenges. We have established specific
sustainability focus areas: water quality and scarcity; packaging materials used for our products; reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; sustainable
sourcing of agricultural commodities; diversity, equity and inclusion; and human and workplace rights. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals is dependent on many
factors, including, but not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling partners, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental
organizations, communities, and other third parties, all of which are outside of our control.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), which require
management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our
most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
•Principles of Consolidation
•Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets
•Pension Plan Valuations
•Revenue Recognition
•Income Taxes
Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of
Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and on actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately
differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Principles of Consolidation
Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even
though the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another
business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity’s voting
interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a
variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a variable interest is referred to as a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the
primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these
VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these
financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the
VIEs’ economic performance. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are accounted for as
consolidated entities.
We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and
financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our
36
Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes
considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany
transactions.
We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion
of transactions with equity method investees.
Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets
Our Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries and territories in which we operate,
particularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading “Our Business — Challenges and Risks” above and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this report. As a
result, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and
noncurrent assets in various regions around the world.
We perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are
required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently
if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.
The performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management
judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others,
the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term
growth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers’ financial
condition. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are even more
difficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The estimates we use when performing
recoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using
management’s best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets
that are more dependent on cash flows generated in away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas which are more heavily impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore these assets are more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are
naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. If
we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different
assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to
record could be material. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to the heading “Operations Review” below for additional information related to our present business
environment.
As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (“CCBJHI”) exceeded its fair value by $29 million, or 8 percent.
Based on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time
sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an
impairment charge related to the investment.
Our equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company
records its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with
respect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.
Investments in Equity and Debt Securities
We measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in
net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable
fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual
basis.
37
Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt
securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities
that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt
securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt
securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to
the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for
impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable
fair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in
circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to
our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values
of most of our Company’s investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded
companies, management’s assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as
appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or
estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the
determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other
than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair
value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be
assessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in
the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. When such events or
changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its
eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount
exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models.
These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.
Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to
amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, recoverability tests must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, impairment tests must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances
indicate that an asset may be impaired.
The performance of recoverability and impairment tests of intangible assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment,
include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the
economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth
rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers’ financial condition.
These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of intangible assets
are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management’s best assumptions,
which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The
variability of these factors depends on a number
38
of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used
when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is
practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods or if different conditions
exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading “Operations Review” below for additional information related to our present business
environment.
Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and
macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it
could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in
our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates.
Additionally, we are required to ensure that the assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions that we believe a market
participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of
whether our Company’s actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an
intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.
We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on
geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller
geographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and doğadan
businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling
Investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within
our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each
business combination.
In order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. However, the impairment
charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The
assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of
goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further
assessment.
When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the
carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our
internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we
recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to
determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant
would use.
We test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate
that an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in
conducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are
consistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment
charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than
goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its
carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any
further assessment.

Pension Plan Valuations
Our Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans for certain employees in the United
States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans outside the United States.
Management is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or
income. We believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed
annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our
pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income.
The discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and
certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit
cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the
respective countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the
yield curve to the plans’ projected cash flows.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each
asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our investment
objective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company
periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk.
In 2022, the Company’s net periodic pension income was $124 million. In 2023, we expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately $40 million. The primary driver of
this change is the unfavorable performance of plan assets in 2022, partially offset by the net impact of the increase in the weighted-average discount rate at December 31, 2022
compared to December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 64 percent and 61 percent of the Company’s consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan
assets, respectively. For this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $13 million increase in our 2023 net periodic pension cost,
and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a $21 million increase in our 2023 net periodic pension
cost.
Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the
promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is
transferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which
completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing
defects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally
be collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have
an original duration of one year or less.
Our customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume ‑ based incentive programs, support for
infrastructure programs, and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value,
aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing
model. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished
products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an
estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance
obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when
uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we expect to receive. In making
40
our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3)
customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable
consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than at the individual contract level. The result of
making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. The actual amounts
ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates.
Income Taxes
Our annual effective tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our
annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we
determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position
is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax
position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing
authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative
intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of
the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing
facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Refer to the heading “Operations Review — Income Taxes” below and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. The number of years subject to tax audits or tax assessments varies
depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold would be
recognized in income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is “more likely than
not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has
expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Tax laws require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the
annual effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are
permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are
the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the
Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.
We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future
operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A
valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit
associated with a deferred tax asset.
The Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis
difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision
as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account various items, including, but not limited to,
forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other
non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions
on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company’s local country subsidiary to pay a dividend),
economic stability and asset risk. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

OPERATIONS REVIEW
Our organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and
Bottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services organization. For additional information regarding our
operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands
In order to continually improve upon the Company’s operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and
other manufacturing operations. In addition, we periodically acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our
beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company’s performance.
Unit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company’s performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The
Company’s unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its
bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading “Beverage
Volume” below.
Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or
used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents
the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers.
Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” below.
When we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2)
changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined
below), as applicable. Refer to the heading “Net Operating Revenues” below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling
partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or
syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products
manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate
revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the
concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated
bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate sales to the extent of our ownership interest, until the equity
method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. We typically report unit case volume when finished products
manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.
We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as “structural changes,” which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural
changes do not impact the Company’s unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit
case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our
Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer
to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s acquisitions and divestitures.
“Acquired brands” refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume
related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are
incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.
“Licensed brands” refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which
we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to
a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and
concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.
42
In August 2022, the Company acquired a controlling interest in a bottling operation in Malawi. The impact of this acquisition has been included as a structural change in our
analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segments. Additionally, in
November 2022, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Cambodia. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net
operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.
In November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining ownership interest in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”). The impact of this acquisition has been included in
acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment.
Beverage Volume
We measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, “unit case” means
a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink
beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and “unit case volume” means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company
beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products
bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system
bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain
joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system
because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company
from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances
expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink
beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case
equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period.
Factors such as seasonality, bottlers’ inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create
differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which
the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between
unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.

Unit Case Volume
The Coca-Cola system sold 32.7 billion and 31.3 billion unit cases of our products in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily a result of strength in away-from-
home channels and ongoing investments in the marketplace.
Unit case volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa increased 3 percent, which included 4 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 6 percent growth in water, sports, coffee
and tea, and 2 percent growth in sparkling flavors, partially offset by a 13 percent decline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. The operating segment
reported growth in unit case volume of 8 percent in the Eurasia and Middle East operating unit and 1 percent in the Europe operating unit. Unit case volume in the Africa
operating unit was even. The growth in the Europe operating unit included the impact of the suspension of the Company’s business in Russia. The performance in the Africa
operating unit included the impact of transitioning certain territories to new franchise bottling partners.
In Latin America, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which included 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 10 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, 6 percent
growth in sparkling flavors and 10 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. The operating segment’s volume performance included 5 percent
growth in Mexico, 9 percent growth in Brazil and 11 percent growth in Argentina.
Unit case volume in North America increased 2 percent, which included 1 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 3 percent growth in both sparkling flavors and juice, value-
added dairy and plant-based beverages, and even performance in water, sports, coffee and tea.
In Asia Pacific, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which included 8 percent growth in sparkling flavors, 6 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 4 percent growth in
water, sports, coffee and tea, and 9 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. The operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 36
percent in the India and Southwest Asia operating unit, 6 percent in the ASEAN and South Pacific operating unit, and 2 percent in the Japan and South Korea operating unit,
partially offset by a decline of 3 percent in the Greater China and Mongolia operating unit.
Unit case volume for Global Ventures increased 13 percent, driven by 12 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea along with growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a
decline of 3 percent in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages.
Unit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 12 percent, which primarily reflects growth in India, South Africa and Vietnam.
Concentrate Sales Volume
In 2022, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 5 percent compared to 2021. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case
volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in
which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals.

Net Operating Revenues
Net operating revenues were $43,004 million in 2022, compared to $38,655 million in 2021, an increase of $4,349 million, or 11 percent.
The following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues on a consolidated basis
and for each of our operating segments:

Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures
operating segment (expressed in unit case equivalents) after considering the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, if any . For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the
percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any . Our Bottling Investments operating
segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only after considering the impact of structural changes, if any . Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above.
Includes structural changes, if any . Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands” above.
Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volumes.
“Price, product and geographic mix” refers to the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix
of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. The impact of price, product and geographic mix is calculated by subtracting the change in net operating
revenues resulting from volume increases or decreases, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures from the total change in net operating
revenues. Management believes that providing investors with price, product and geographic mix enhances their understanding about the combined impact that the following
items had on the Company’s net operating revenues: (1) pricing actions taken by the Company and, where applicable, our bottling partners; (2) changes in the mix of products
and packages sold; (3) changes in the mix of channels where products were sold; and (4) changes in the mix of geographic territories where products were sold. Management
uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.
Price, product and geographic mix had an 11 percent favorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety
of factors and events, including, but not limited to, the following:
•Europe, Middle East and Africa — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Türkiye, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;
•Latin America — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Argentina, along with favorable channel and package mix;
•North America — favorable pricing initiatives, including a benefit resulting from the timing of price increases in the prior year, and favorable channel, package and
product mix;
•Asia Pacific — favorable pricing initiatives along with favorable channel and package mix, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;
•Global Ventures — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel mix, primarily due to the timing of Costa retail store reopenings in the United Kingdom in the
prior year, offset by the unfavorable impact of no longer receiving COVID-related incentives in the current year; and
•Bottling Investments — favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix.1 2

The favorable channel and package mix for the year ended December 31, 2022 in all applicable operating segments was primarily a result of strength in away-from-home
channels in the current year and the impact of social distancing measures in the prior year.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 7 percent. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S.
dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Turkish lira, euro, British pound sterling, Philippine peso, South African rand and Argentine peso,
which had an unfavorable impact on our Asia Pacific; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Global Ventures; Bottling Investments; and Latin America operating segments. The
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign
currencies, including the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Latin America operating segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital
Resources and Financial Position — Foreign Exchange” below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
“Acquisitions and divestitures” generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The
impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we
removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that
quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company’s net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their
understanding of the Company’s net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of
acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company’s performance. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands” above for
additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.
Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and
divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we
expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2023 net operating revenues.
Information about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows:
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021
Europe, Middle East & Africa 16.0 % 17.0 %
Latin America 11.4 10.7 
North America 36.5 34.1 
Asia Pacific 11.0 12.1 
Global Ventures 6.6 7.3 
Bottling Investments 18.3 18.6 
Corporate 0.2 0.2 
Total 100.0 % 100.0 %
The percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating revenues in some operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to
other operating segments. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impact the percentage contribution of each operating segment. For additional information
about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — Foreign Exchange” below.
Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information
related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses
this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.
46
Our gross profit margin decreased to 58.1 percent in 2022 from 60.3 percent in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations, increased commodity and transportation costs, and the acquisition of BodyArmor, a finished goods business, in November 2021. The impact of these items
was partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as well as favorable channel and package mix. We expect commodity and transportation costs to continue to have an
unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin in 2023, and we will continue to proactively take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
The following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021
Selling and distribution expenses $ 2,767 $ 2,574 
Advertising expenses 4,319 4,098 
Stock-based compensation expense 356 337 
Other operating expenses 5,438 5,135 
Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 12,880 $ 12,144 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $736 million, or 6 percent, in 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased marketing spending, higher selling and
distribution expenses, and higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense. The increase in selling and distribution expenses was due to the continued recovery
from the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to our strong financial performance in 2022 and a more favorable outlook
of our future financial performance, which resulted in higher payout assumptions as compared to 2021. In 2022, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased selling,
general and administrative expenses by 6 percent.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $325 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which
we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-
based compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Operating Charges
Other operating charges incurred by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021

North America 19 39 
Asia Pacific 57 12 
Global Ventures — — 
Bottling Investments — — 
Corporate 1,146 643 
Total $ 1,215 $ 846 
In 2022, the Company recorded other operating charges of $1,215 million. These charges primarily consisted of $1,000 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent
consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with our acquisition of fairlife, LLC ("fairlife") in 2020, $85 million related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment
program and $57 million related to the impairment of a trademark in Asia Pacific. In addition, other operating charges included $38 million related to the restructuring of our
North America operating unit and $38 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition in 2021, which included various transition and transaction costs, employee retention costs
and the amortization of noncompete agreements, net of the reimbursement of distributor termination fees recorded in 2021. These charges were partially offset by a net gain of
$6 million due to revisions of management’s estimates related to the Company’s strategic realignment initiatives.
In 2021, the Company recorded other operating charges of $846 million. These charges primarily consisted of $369 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent
consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, $146 million related to the Company’s strategic realignment initiatives, $119 million related to
the BodyArmor acquisition, which includes various transition and transaction costs, distributor termination fees, employee retention costs and the amortization of noncompete
agreements, and $115 million related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment program. In
47
addition, other operating charges included an impairment charge of $78 million related to a trademark in Europe, which was driven by a change in the long-term outlook on the
licensing arrangement for a certain brand, charges of $15 million related to tax litigation and a net charge of $4 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing
operations in the United States.
Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the BodyArmor and fairlife acquisitions. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information related to the tax litigation. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the
impairment charges. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s restructuring initiatives. Refer to Note 19 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these charges had on our operating segments and Corporate.

Operating income was $10,909 million in 2022, compared to $10,308 million in 2021, an increase of $601 million, or 6 percent. The increase in operating income was
primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 5 percent, favorable channel and package mix, and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by higher other
operating charges; increased marketing spending; and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact.
The decrease in our operating margin on a consolidated basis was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased commodity
and transportation costs, increased marketing spending, and the acquisition of BodyArmor, a finished goods business, in November 2021. The impact of these items was
partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as well as favorable channel and package mix.
In 2022, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 9 percent due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain
foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Turkish lira, euro, Argentine peso, and British pound sterling, which had an unfavorable impact on our Asia Pacific; Europe,
Middle East and Africa; Latin America; and Global Ventures operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was
partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including
48
the Mexican peso and Brazilian real, which had a favorable impact on our Latin America operating segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial
Position — Foreign Exchange” below.
The Company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment reported operating income of $3,958 million and $3,735 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by a 2 percent increase in concentrate sales volume, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel
and package mix, and lower other operating charges, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 17 percent, higher commodity costs, increased
operating expenses and increased marketing spending.
Latin America reported operating income of $2,870 million and $2,534 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in operating
income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 7 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and lower other operating
charges, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 6 percent, higher commodity costs and increased marketing spending.
Operating income for North America for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $3,742 million and $3,331 million, respectively. The increase in operating income
was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 1 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and category mix and lower other operating charges,
partially offset by increased marketing spending and increased operating expenses.
Asia Pacific’s operating income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2,303 million and $2,325 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was
primarily driven by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 8 percent, increased marketing spending, increased operating expenses and higher other operating
charges, partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 8 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, and favorable channel and package mix.
Global Ventures’ operating income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $185 million and $293 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was
primarily driven by the impact of no longer receiving COVID-related incentives in the current year, higher commodity costs, higher selling and distribution expenses, and an
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 2 percent, partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 13 percent.
Bottling Investments’ operating income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $487 million and $473 million, respectively. The increase in operating income
was primarily driven by unit case volume growth of 12 percent and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 9
percent and higher selling and distribution expenses.
Corporate’s operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2,636 million and $2,383 million, respectively. Operating loss in 2022 increased primarily as
a result of higher other operating charges due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition and
increased marketing spending.
Interest Income
Interest income was $449 million in 2022, compared to $276 million in 2021, an increase of $173 million, or 62 percent. This increase was primarily driven by higher returns in
certain of our international locations.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $882 million in 2022, compared to $1,597 million in 2021, a decrease of $715 million, or 45 percent. This decrease was primarily due to charges in 2021
of $650 million associated with the extinguishment of long-term debt and certain hedging activities that occurred during 2021, partially offset by the impact of higher interest
rates in 2022. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Equity Income (Loss) — Net
Equity income (loss) — net represents our Company’s proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. In 2022, equity income was $1,472
million, compared to equity income of $1,438 million in 2021, an increase of $34 million, or 2 percent. The increase was primarily due to more favorable operating results
reported by several of our equity method investees in the current year, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact and the sale of all or a portion of
our ownership interest in certain equity method investees. In addition, the Company recorded net charges of $34 million and $13 million during the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively, which represent the Company’s proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method
investees.
49
Other Income (Loss) — Net
Other income (loss) — net includes, among other things, dividend income; gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment; gains and losses related to
acquisitions and divestitures; non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; other charges and credits
related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans; realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities; realized gains and losses on
available-for-sale debt securities; other-than-temporary impairment charges; and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses
are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these
assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In 2022, other income (loss) — net was a loss of $262 million. The Company recorded a net loss of $371 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity
securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net foreign currency exchange losses of $236 million, an other-
than-temporary impairment charge of $96 million related to an equity method investee in Russia, and a net loss of $24 million as a result of one of our equity method investees
issuing additional shares of its stock. Additionally, other income (loss) — net included net income of $219 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic
benefit income, a net gain of $153 million related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in Cambodia and dividend income of $111 million.
In 2021, other income (loss) — net was income of $2,000 million. The Company recognized a gain of $834 million in conjunction with the BodyArmor acquisition; a net gain
of $695 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (“CCA”), an equity method investee, to CCEP, also an equity method investee; and a
net gain of $114 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method
investee. Additionally, the Company recognized a net gain of $467 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as
well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Other income (loss) — net also included $277 million related to the non-service cost components of net
periodic benefit income, dividend income of $73 million, charges of $266 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States, pension plan
settlement charges of $117 million related to our strategic realignment initiatives and net foreign currency exchange losses of $61 million.

refranchising of our bottling operations in Cambodia. Refer to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on equity and debt securities.
Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States and the
impairment charges. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s strategic realignment initiatives. Refer to
Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these items had on our operating segments and Corporate.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal
tax rate. As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa
Rica, Singapore and Eswatini. The terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. Tax
incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $406 million and $381 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, our
effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method.

A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows:
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021
Statutory U.S. federal tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 %
State and local income taxes — net of federal benefit 1.4 1.1 
Earnings in jurisdictions taxed at rates different from the statutory U.S. federal tax rate (0.6) 2.3

Excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation (0.7) (0.5)
Other — net (0.3) (0.8)
Effective tax rate 18.1 % 21.1 %
Includes net tax char ges of $375 million (or a 3.0 percent impact on our ef fective tax rate) related to changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions, amounts required to be recorded for
changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, in various international jurisdictions, as well as other discrete items.
Includes a tax benefit of $14 million (or a 1.5 percent impact on our ef fective tax rate) associated with the $834 million gain recorded upon the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in
BodyArmor . Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company’s 2015 litigation with the IRS involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court
predominantly sided with the IRS. The Company disagrees with the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
As of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $926 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would
be a benefit of $617 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $309 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in
different tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.
A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021
Balance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 906 $ 915 
Increase related to prior period tax positions 6 9 
Decrease related to prior period tax positions — (50)
Increase related to current period tax positions 38 37 
Decrease related to settlements with taxing authorities (2) (4)
Effect of foreign currency translation (22) (1)
Balance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 926 $ 906 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. The Company had
$496 million and $453 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, expense
of $43 million and $62 million was recognized in 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would
be a benefit to the Company’s effective tax rate.
Based on current tax laws, the Company’s effective tax rate in 2023 is expected to be approximately 19.5 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant
operating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.
LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION
We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating
Activities” below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase
our return on shareowners’ equity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and
internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use
of a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to
continue to be able to do so in the future. The Company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt.1

51
The Company’s cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $11.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. In addition to these funds, our
commercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $4.4 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2022.
These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2023 through 2028.
Our current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage
portfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2023 capital expenditures to be
approximately $1.9 billion. During 2023, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans.
We are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the
IRS; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions
of the Opinion affirming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more
likely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the
Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS were ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the
consent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2022, the Company currently estimates that the
potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022. Additional income tax and interest would continue to
accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice
of appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be
approximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2022), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 11 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.
While we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from
operating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.
Based on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and
cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
As part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions,
including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a
voluntary supply chain finance (“SCF”) program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions
on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods and services
included in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The
Company and our suppliers agree on contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier
elects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices to the Company based on the
agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to
the financial institutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company
or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial
relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are
included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in
the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed by the financial institutions that as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, suppliers had elected to sell $1,234 million and $882 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions.
The amounts settled through the SCF program were $4,724 million and $3,237 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not believe
there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future.
52
The Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial
institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits
those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $10,709 million and $6,266 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $27 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $11,018 million and $12,625 million, respectively, a decrease of $1,607 million,
or 13 percent. This decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing payments resulting from 2021 year-end accruals, an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations, the buildup of inventory to manage potential supply chain disruptions, and higher annual incentive and tax payments in 2022. These items were
partially offset by increased operating income, lower payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives, and increased benefits from the extension of certain vendor
payment terms and our trade accounts receivable factoring program.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $763 million and $2,765 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Purchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments
In 2022, purchases of investments were $3,751 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,771 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,020 million. In
2021, purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029 million. This
activity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the
Company’s overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance
companies.
Acquisitions of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities
In 2022, the Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $73 million.
In 2021, the Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of
the remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor.
Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.
Proceeds from Disposals of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities
In 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $458 million, which primarily related to the refranchising of
our bottling operations in Cambodia and the sale of our ownership interest in one of our equity method investments.
In 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our
ownership interest in CCA, an equity method investee, to CCEP, also an equity method investee.
Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our disposals.
Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment
Purchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1,484 million and $1,367 million, respectively.
53
Total capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021
Capital expenditures $ 1,484 $ 1,367 
Europe, Middle East & Africa 3.3 % 2.6 %
Latin America 0.3 0.1

Collateral (Paid) Received Associated with Hedging Activities — Net
Collateral paid associated with our hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1,465 million. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on our hedging activities.
Other Investing Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash inflow for other investing activities was $706 million and $51 million, respectively. The activities during
2022 included cash proceeds of $823 million received in advance of the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on this transaction.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $10,250 million and $6,786 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Debt Financing
Our Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our
overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners’ equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our
credit ratings.
As of December 31, 2022, our long-term debt was rated “A+” by Standard & Poor’s and “A1” by Moody’s. Our commercial paper program was rated “A-1” by Standard &
Poor’s and “P-1” by Moody’s. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and
financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial
information of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the
debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company’s business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep
these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in
our capital structure, our major bottlers’ financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our
cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers’ credit ratings were to decline, the Company’s equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential
increase in interest expense for those bottlers.
We monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different
aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our
Company.
Our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture,
coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of
borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.
Issuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During 2022, the Company had issuances of debt of $3,972 million, which
included $2,321 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $798 million of net issuances of commercial paper and
short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $853 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.
54
During 2022, the Company made payments of debt of $4,930 million, which consisted of $3,623 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with
maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $1,307 million.
During 2021, the Company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which included $3,391 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities
greater than 90 days, $80 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $9,623 million,
net of related discounts and issuance costs.
During 2021, the Company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with
maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $10,509 million.
On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference
rates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, will continue to be published through June
2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended, or will amend, our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight
Financing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. We do not plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference LIBOR in the future.
Issuances of Stock
The issuances of stock in 2022 and 2021 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees.
Share Repurchases
In 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 500 million shares (“2012 Plan”) of the Company’s common stock. In May 2022, the Company
reached the maximum number of shares that could be repurchased under the 2012 Plan and thereby completed the plan. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share
repurchase plan of up to 150 million shares of the Company’s common stock.
During 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. The Company repurchased 21.3 million shares of common stock under the share
repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $62.67, for a total cost of $1,336 million. Since the
inception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.53. In addition to shares
repurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company’s treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to
pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted
stock issued to employees. The net impact of the Company’s issuances of stock and share repurchases during 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $581 million.
During 2021, the Company did not repurchase shares of our common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors.
Dividends
The Company paid dividends of $7,616 million and $7,252 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
At its February 2023 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.84 per share in 2023.
This is our 61 consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.76 per share and $1.68 per share in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Other Financing Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash outflow for other financing activities was $1,095 million and $353 million, respectively. The activities
during 2022 included payments totaling $637 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included amounts originally held back for indemnification obligations.
Additionally, other financing activities during 2022 and 2021 included repayments of collateral related to our hedging programs.st

Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions):

Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper , we typically issue
new commercial paper . Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.
Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding long-term debt. We will consider several alternatives for settling this long-term debt,
including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. The table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the
Company and excludes the noncash portion of debt, including any fair market value adjustments, unamortized discounts and premiums.
We calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the December 31, 2022 rate for all
periods presented. We expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings.
Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. Accrued income taxes include $2,886 million related to the one-time transition
tax required by the Tax Reform Act. Liabilities of $1,424 million for unrecognized tax benefits plus accrued interest and penalties are not included in the total above. Currently , the settlement
period for the unrecognized tax benefits cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully of fset by reductions in payments in other
jurisdictions.
Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These agreements include long-term
contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities.
We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities.
Represents obligations related to our acquisitions of fairlife and BodyArmor . Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Represents $823 million received in December 2022 in advance of the refranchising of the Company’ s bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023 as well as liabilities and contractual
obligations that were classified as held for sale. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The total accrued liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2022 was $942 million. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, net periodic benefit cost or income, plan funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics
and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the table
above.
We expect to make all contributions to our pension trusts with cash flows from operating activities. Our pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and
tax regulations. The Company expects to contribute approximately $42 million in 2023 to our pension trusts, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. Refer to
Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above.1

As of December 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plan was $4,101 million, and the fair value of the plan assets was $4,336 million. The
projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plan was $2,275 million, and the fair value of the plans’ assets was $2,822 million. The
Company sponsors various unfunded pension plans outside the United States as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans covering certain U.S. employees. These U.S.
nonqualified pension plans provide benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The
expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans will
be approximately $65 million annually for 2023 through 2025. Thereafter, the expected annual benefit payments will gradually decline. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the
Company’s risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company’s self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry,
adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims history. As of December 31, 2022, our self-insurance reserves totaled $199 million. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above.
Deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2022 were $2,914 million. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in
the table above because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the underlying assets or liabilities are settled at their
reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future years. As a result,
scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.
As of December 31, 2022, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $1,017 million, of which $133 million was related to VIEs. Our
guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and arose through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none
of these guarantees is individually significant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees.
However, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31,
2022, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity.
Foreign Exchange
Our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each
country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in currencies. Due to the
geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time.
In 2022 and 2021, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual
currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows:
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021
All operating currencies (8)% 2 %
Australian dollar (7)% 10 %
Brazilian real 4 (4)
British pound sterling (11) 3 
Euro (11) 5 
Japanese yen (17) (2)
Mexican peso 1 6 
South African rand (9) 6 
The percentages in the table above do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates on our operating results. Our hedging activities are designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations
on our net income.
The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 7 percent in 2022 and
an increase of 1 percent in 2021. The total impact of foreign currency
57
exchange rate fluctuations on income before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 6 percent in 2022 and an increase of 2 percent in
2021.
Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies.
The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated
balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other income (loss) —
net in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading “Operations Review — Other Income (Loss) — Net” above. The Company recorded net foreign currency
exchange losses of $236 million and $61 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
Inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the
inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.
ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices
and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by
hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, fluctuations in the values of the
instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying exposures.
We monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging
transactions and derivative financial instruments.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
We manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2022, we
generated $27.6 billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies
may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations.
Our Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge
certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign
operations.
The total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $11,370 million and $13,691 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These values included
derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency
derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $66 million as of December 31, 2022, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the
U.S. dollar would have increased the net unrealized loss to $296 million. The fair value of the foreign currency derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in
a net unrealized loss of $20 million as of December 31, 2022, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $137 million decrease in
fair value.
Interest Rates
The Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix
of short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Based on the Company’s variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2022, we estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates
would have increased interest expense by $136 million in 2022. However, this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income
due to higher interest rates.
58
The Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid debt securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the
guidelines of the Company’s investment policy. Our policy requires these investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the risk of principal
loss. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a $29
million decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly liquid debt securities.
Commodity Prices
The Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels. We
manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements, which enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are
used in our manufacturing and distribution operations. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to further manage our exposure to commodity risks.
Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the
purchases and transportation of materials used in our manufacturing processes.
The total notional values of our commodity derivatives were $371 million and $918 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These values included derivative
instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. There were no significant commodity
derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of the commodity derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net
loss of $1 million as of December 31, 2022, and we estimate that a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices would have resulted in an $8 million decrease in fair
value.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
When used in these notes, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated
financial statements.
Description of Business
The Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark
Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world’s
top six nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light. Finished beverage products bearing our
trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories.
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and
retailers as well as the Company’s consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the
estimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of
current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for
impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges may result.
Principles of Consolidation
Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even
though the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another
business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity’s voting
interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a
variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary
beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
(2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these
VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding
variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance. Our Company’s
investments, plus any loans and guarantees, and other subordinated financial support related to these VIEs totaled $1,626 million and $1,980 million as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company’s investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not individually
significant to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. As a result, we have
consolidated these entities. Our Company’s investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $109 million and $103 million as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.
66
We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial
policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the
level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in
policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.
We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion
of transactions with equity method investees.
Revenue Recognition
Our Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally
consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Refer to Note 3. 
Advertising Costs
Our Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures
are expensed in the annual period in which the expenditure is incurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our
consolidated statements of income were $4 billion, $4 billion and $3 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, advertising and
production costs of $35 million and $57 million, respectively, were primarily recorded in the line item prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance
sheets.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold
in our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers
are also included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods sold by our consolidated bottlers to
our customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us
separately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to
fulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised
to customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are
accrued.
Sales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes
The Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf
of its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were
collected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our
consolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our
consolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales,
inventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that
could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. We excluded 8 million, 6 million and 6 million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2022,
2021 and 2020, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents
We classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash
equivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line
item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification
of counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk.
67
The following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents that constitute the total amounts shown in our consolidated
statements of cash flows (in millions):
December 31, 2022 2021 2020
Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,519 $ 9,684 $ 6,795 
Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 306 341 315 
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 9,825 $ 10,025 $ 7,110 
Amounts include cash and cash equivalents in our solvency capital portfolio, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 4.
Amounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 include cash and cash equivalents related to assets held for sale, which are included in the line item prepaid expenses and other current assets in our
consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2.
Short-Term Investments
We classify time deposits and other investments that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year as short-term investments.
Investments in Equity and Debt Securities
We measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in
net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable
fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual
basis. Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to
hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value
and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on our policy for investments, which includes our assessment of impairments.
Trade Accounts Receivable
We record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any expected loss on the
trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on available relevant information, in addition to
historical loss information, the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and the economic status of, our bottling
partners and customers. We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.
The Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial
institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits
those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $10,709 million and $6,266 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $27 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The Company accounts for this program as a sale, and accordingly, the trade receivables sold are excluded from the line item trade accounts receivable in our
consolidated balance sheet. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of raw materials and packaging (which include ingredients and supplies) and finished goods (which include concentrates and syrups in our
concentrate operations and finished beverages in our finished product operations). Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost on the
basis of the average cost or first-in, first-out methods.1,2

Finished goods 1,247 982 
Other 359 299 
Total inventories $ 4,233 $ 3,414 
Derivative Instruments
When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed
by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair
value in our consolidated balance sheet in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and
accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The cash flow impact of the Company’s derivative instruments is primarily included in our consolidated statement of cash
flows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer to Note 5.
Leases
We determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and
circumstances. We are the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the right to control the asset. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an
underlying asset for the lease term and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation
to make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated
balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at
the commencement date. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Leases with a lease term of 12
months or less at inception are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our
consolidated statement of income. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the information available
at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When our contracts contain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components
as a single lease component. Refer to Note 9.
We have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income
associated with these leases is not material.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following
ranges: buildings and improvements: 40 years or less; and machinery and equipment: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated
until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we are
reasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is
classified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense of
assets under finance leases, totaled $1,125 million, $1,262 million and $1,301 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements
totaled $13 million, $15 million and $18 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
69
The following table summarizes our property, plant and equipment (in millions):
December 31, 2022 2021
Land $ 611 $ 652 
Buildings and improvements 4,434 4,349 
Machinery and equipment 14,030 13,861 
Property, plant and equipment — cost 19,075 18,862 
Less: Accumulated depreciation 9,234 8,942 
Property, plant and equipment — net $ 9,841 $ 9,920 
Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among
others, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with
historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows
expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal
planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The
impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine
the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are
consistent with those a market participant would use.
Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets
We classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to
amortization; and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each
intangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset,
the Company’s long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including
competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives,
which is less than 20 years. Refer to Note 7.
When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the
carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting profit and cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual
disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without
interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which include
assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.
We test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events
or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of
methodologies in conducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which include assumptions we
believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an
impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other
than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its
carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any
further assessment.
We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on
geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller
geographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa Limited (“Costa”), innocent and
doğadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), each of
which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling
70
Investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within
our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each
business combination.
In order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value,
including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the
fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair
value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a
qualitative assessment of goodwill in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the
Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.
Impairment charges related to intangible assets, including goodwill, are generally recorded in the line item other operating charges or, to the extent they relate to equity method
investees, in the line item equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.
Contingencies
Our Company is involved in various legal proceedings and tax matters. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties, including, but
not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a
liability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Refer to Note 11.
Stock-Based Compensation
Our Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. These awards include stock options,
performance share units, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The fair value of stock option awards is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The
Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years.
The fair value of restricted stock, restricted stock units and certain performance share units is the closing market price per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date less
the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period. The Company included a relative total shareowner return (“TSR”) modifier for most
performance share unit awards granted from 2014 through 2017 as well as for performance share unit awards granted to executives from 2018 through 2022. For these awards,
the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company’s total
shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a predefined range. The fair value of
performance share units that include a TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
In the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit award will be achieved, we recognize
compensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance
share units expected to vest. The remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the vesting
period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all of the
previously recognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.
The Company has made a policy election to estimate the number of stock-based compensation awards that will ultimately vest to determine the amount of compensation
expense recognized each reporting period. Forfeiture estimates are trued-up at the end of the vesting period in order to ensure that compensation expense is recognized only for
those awards that ultimately vest. Refer to Note 12.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary
differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the
year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be
realized.
The Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any
of our tax positions at the time we determine that it becomes uncertain based
71
upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a
lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of
evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their
applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other
tax positions taken. A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment is raised. The number of
years subject to tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the “more likely than
not” recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions:
(1) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of
limitations for the tax position has expired. Refer to Note 11 and Note 14.
Translation and Remeasurement
We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars at the appropriate spot rates as of the balance sheet
date. Generally, our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. Changes in the carrying values of these assets and liabilities attributable to
fluctuations in spot rates are recognized in net foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). Refer to
Note 15. Accounts in our consolidated statement of income are translated using the monthly average exchange rates during the year.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from a reporting entity’s functional currency must be remeasured from the applicable currency to the
reporting entity’s functional currency. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are recognized in the line item other income (loss) — net in our
consolidated statement of income and are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to
Note 5.
NOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
Acquisitions
During 2022, our Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $73 million. During 2021, our Company’s acquisitions
of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in
BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”). During 2020, our Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $1,052
million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in fairlife, LLC (“fairlife”).
BA Sports Nutrition, LLC
In November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85 percent ownership interest in, and now owns 100 percent of, BodyArmor, which offers a line of sports performance
and hydration beverages in the United States. We acquired the remaining ownership interest in exchange for approximately $5,600 million of cash, of which $4,745 million was
paid at close, net of cash acquired. The purchase price reflected the contractual discount included in the purchase option we obtained with our initial investment in 2018. The
remaining $860 million of the purchase price was held back related to indemnification obligations, of which $540 million was included in the line item accounts payable and
accrued expenses and $320 million was included in the line item other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31,
2022, $549 million of the $860 million had been paid and $311 million remained in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet.
Upon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The fair value of
our previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 16. The gain was recorded in the line item
other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $4.2 billion of the purchase price was allocated to the
BodyArmor trademark and $2.2 billion was allocated to goodwill, of which $1.2 billion is tax deductible. The goodwill recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related
to the synergistic value created from leveraging the capabilities, assets and scale of the Company and the opportunity for international expansion. It also includes certain other
intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. Of the total amount allocated to goodwill, $1.9 billion has been assigned to the
North America operating segment and $0.3 billion has been assigned to our other geographic operating segments.
72
fairlife, LLC
In January 2020, the Company acquired the remaining 57.5 percent ownership interest in, and now owns 100 percent of, fairlife. fairlife offers a broad portfolio of products in
the value-added dairy category across North America. Upon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $902 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held
equity interest in fairlife to fair value. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs, as
defined in Note 16. The gain was recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. We acquired the remaining ownership interest in
exchange for $979 million of cash, net of cash acquired, and effectively settled our $306 million note receivable from fairlife at the recorded amount. Under the terms of the
agreement, we are subject to making future milestone payments which are contingent on fairlife achieving certain financial targets through 2024 and, if achieved, are payable in
2021, 2023 and 2025. These milestone payments are based on agreed-upon formulas related to fairlife’s operating results, the resulting values of which are not subject to a
ceiling. Under the applicable accounting guidance, we recorded a $270 million liability representing our best estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration as of the
acquisition date. The fair value of this contingent consideration was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model based on Level 3 inputs, including management’s latest
estimates of future operating results. We are required to remeasure this liability to fair value quarterly, with any changes in the fair value recorded in income until the final
milestone payment is made. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $1.3 billion of the purchase price was allocated to the fairlife trademark and $0.8 billion was allocated to
goodwill. The goodwill recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related to synergistic value created from the opportunity for additional expansion. It also includes
certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. The goodwill is not tax deductible and has been assigned to the
North America operating segment.
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges of $1,000 million, $369 million and $51 million, respectively. These charges related to the
remeasurement of the contingent consideration liability to fair value and were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we made the first milestone payment of $100 million based on fairlife meeting its financial targets in 2020.
Divestitures
During 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $458 million, which primarily related to the refranchising
of our bottling operations in Cambodia. We received net cash proceeds of $228 million and recognized a net gain of $153 million as a result of the refranchising. Also included
was the sale of our ownership interest in one of our equity method investees, for which we received cash proceeds of $123 million and recognized a net gain of $13 million.
During 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our
ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (“CCA”), an equity method investee, to Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc (“CCEP”), also an equity method investee. We
received cash proceeds of $1,738 million and recognized a net gain of $695 million as a result of the sale and the related reversal of cumulative translation adjustments. Also
included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received
cash proceeds of $293 million and recognized a net gain of $114 million as a result of these sales.
During 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $189 million, which primarily related to the sale of our
ownership interest in Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $100 million and
recognized a net loss of $2 million as a result of this sale. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our
ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $62 million and recognized a net gain of $35 million as a result of these sales.
All of the gains and losses discussed above were recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income.
Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale
As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a result, we were required to record
their assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. As the fair value less any costs to sell exceeded the carrying value, the related assets
and liabilities were recorded at their carrying value. These assets and liabilities were included in the Bottling Investments operating segment.
The Company refranchised its bottling operations in Cambodia in November 2022. In December 2022, the Company received cash proceeds of $823 million in advance of
refranchising its bottling operations in Vietnam. This advance was included in the
73
line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and was included in the line item other investing activities in our
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company refranchised its bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023.
The following table presents information related to the major classes of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale and were included in the line items prepaid
expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):

NOTE 3: NET OPERATING REVENUES
Our Company markets, manufactures and sells:
•beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate
operations”); and
•finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations”).
Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.
Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which
we typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the
product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and
refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through
wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which
they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain
syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.
Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and
wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our
Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to
distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments
or our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures
operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate
consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our
North America operating segment.
74
Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the
promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is
transferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which
completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing
defects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally
be collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have
an original duration of one year or less.
Our customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs, support for
infrastructure programs and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned
financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model.
Under this model, the price we charge bottlers for concentrates they use to prepare and package finished products is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited
to, the prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the channels in which they are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described
above represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of
income upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable
that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the
consideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer
sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as
applicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather
than at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable or accounts payable and accrued expenses in our
consolidated balance sheet, as applicable. The actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable
consideration recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was immaterial.
The following table presents net operating revenues disaggregated between the United States and International and further by line of business (in millions):

NOTE 4: INVESTMENTS
We measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in
net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair values of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily
determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes
resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on
an individual basis.
Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt
securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities
that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt
securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt
securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of AOCI, except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if
applicable, which are included in net income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the Company’s fair value hedges of available-for-sale debt securities.
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for
impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable
fair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in
circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to
our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values
of most of our Company’s investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded
companies, management’s assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as
appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or
estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the
determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other
than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair
value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

Captive Insurance Companies
In accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The
Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The
Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and
Canadian pension plans. This captive’s solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,378 million and $1,670 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current
obligations.
NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company’s financial
performance and are referred to as “market risks.” When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of
certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange
rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.
The Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps.
Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined
rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a
predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative
returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect expected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes)
a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified
underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-
derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.
All derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current
assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally
enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to
net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.
The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as
hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign
operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our
consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that
have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our
consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between
the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or
cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are
immediately recognized in earnings.
For derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a
specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at the
inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows
of the related underlying exposures.
The Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 16. The notional amounts
of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial
risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair
78
values of its derivatives in isolation but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures. Virtually all of our
derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.

Credit Risk Associated with Derivatives
We have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty
exposures regularly and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring
collateral for substantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial
instrument increases. In addition, the Company’s master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same
counterparty. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Furthermore, for certain derivative
financial instruments, the Company has agreements with counterparties that require collateral to be exchanged based on changes in the fair value of the instruments. The
Company classifies collateral payments and receipts as investing cash flows when the collateral account is in an asset position and as financing cash flows when the collateral
account is in a liability position. As a result of these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.
Cash Flow Hedging Strategy
The Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into
the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair values of
hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to
the variability in future cash flows is typically three years.
The Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and U.S.
dollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and purchase
foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign
currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in
the fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset
by losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the Company’s foreign currency cash
flow hedging program were $5,510 million and $7,399 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of its foreign currency denominated debt and other monetary assets or liabilities due to
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For this hedging program, the Company recognizes in earnings each period the changes in carrying values of these foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in exchange rates. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an
immediate reclassification into earnings for the changes in fair values attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The total notional values of derivatives that
were designated as cash flow hedges for the Company’s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities were $958 million and $1,994 million as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively.
The Company has entered into commodity futures contracts and other derivative instruments on various commodities to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted
purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process. These derivative instruments were designated as part of the Company’s commodity cash flow hedging program. The
objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of certain commodities. The total notional values of derivatives that
were designated and qualified for this program were $35 million and $10 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Our Company monitors our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly. From time to time, we manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of
derivative financial instruments. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements and has designated these instruments as part of the Company’s interest rate cash
flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program is to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on the Company’s future interest payments.
There were no interest rate swap agreements that were designated and qualified for the Company’s interest rate cash flow hedging program as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months net gains of $56 million from the pretax amount recorded in
AOCI as the anticipated cash flows occur.
Fair Value Hedging Strategy
The Company uses interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from
fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. The Company also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated debt
relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and benchmark interest rates. The changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the
offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged items are recognized in earnings. As a result, any difference is reflected in earnings as ineffectiveness. When a derivative is no
longer designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, including termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged item
at that time and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or immediately if the hedged item has matured or has
been extinguished. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of this type were $13,425 million and $12,113 million as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations Strategy
The Company uses forward contracts and a portion of its foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments
in a number of foreign operations. For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in the fair
values of the derivative financial instruments are recognized in net foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of AOCI, to offset the changes in the values of the net
investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in the
carrying values of the designated portions of the non-derivative financial instruments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are recorded in net foreign currency
translation adjustments. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the period of change.1

The Company reclassified a loss of $4 million related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company did not
reclassify any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020. In addition, the Company did not
have any ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The cash inflows and outflows associated with the
Company’s derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified in the line item other investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Economic (Non-Designated) Hedging Strategy
In addition to derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting, the Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges of foreign
currency, interest rate and commodity exposure. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic
hedges. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.
The Company uses foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on certain monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset those monetary assets and liabilities are immediately
recognized in earnings in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we use foreign currency economic hedges to minimize
the variability in cash flows associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those related to certain acquisition and divestiture activities. The changes
in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset the variability in U.S. dollar net cash flows are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues,
cost of goods sold or other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency
economic hedges were $4,902 million and $4,258 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The Company uses interest rate contracts as economic hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark
interest rates. The total notional value of derivatives related to our economic hedges of this type was $200 million as of December 31, 2021. There were no interest rate
contracts used as economic hedges as of December 31, 2022.
The Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process and
vehicle fuel. The changes in the fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold, or
selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our economic hedges of
this type were $336 million and $908 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
Our consolidated net income includes our Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method investees. When we record our proportionate share of
net income, it increases equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and our carrying value of that investment. Conversely, when we record our
proportionate share of a net loss, it decreases equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and our carrying value of that investment. The Company’s
proportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method investees includes significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by our equity method investees.
These items can have a significant impact on the amount of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and our carrying value of those investments.
Refer to Note 17 for additional information related to significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by our equity method investees. The carrying values of our equity
method investments are also impacted by our proportionate share of items impacting the equity method investees’ AOCI.
We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions to the extent of our ownership interest, including the intercompany portion of transactions with
equity method investees.
The Company’s equity method investments include, but are not limited to, our ownership interests in CCEP; Monster; AC Bebidas, S. de R.L. de C.V.; Coca-Cola
FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V.; Coca-Cola HBC AG; and Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (“CCBJHI”). As of December 31, 2022, we owned 19 percent, 20 percent, 20
percent, 28 percent, 21 percent and 19 percent, respectively, of these companies’ outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2022, our investments in our equity method investees
in the aggregate exceeded our proportionate share of the net assets of these equity method investees by $7,822 million. This difference is not amortized.
A summary of financial information for our equity method investees in the aggregate is as follows (in millions):

decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an impairment char ge related to the investment.
Net Receivables and Dividends from Equity Method Investees
Total net receivables due from equity method investees were $1,191 million and $882 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total amount of dividends
received from equity method investees was $634 million, $823 million and $467 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of
consolidated reinvested earnings that represents undistributed earnings of investments accounted for under the equity method as of December 31, 2022 was $7,030 million.1

NOTE 10: DEBT AND BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS
Short-Term Borrowings
Loans and notes payable consist primarily of commercial paper issued in the United States. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $2,146 million and $2,462 million,
respectively, in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Our weighted-average interest rates for commercial paper outstanding were 4.2 percent and 0.1 percent as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company also had $227 million and $845 million, respectively, in lines of credit, short-
term credit facilities and other short-term borrowings that were related to our international operations.
In addition, we had $5,712 million in unused lines of credit and other short-term credit facilities as of December 31, 2022, of which $4,375 million was in corporate backup
lines of credit for general purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2023 through 2028. There were no borrowings under these corporate backup lines
of credit during 2022. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of
which was significant to our Company.
Long-Term Debt
During 2022, the Company retired upon maturity fixed interest rate Swiss franc notes and U.S. dollar debentures of SFr550 million and $410 million, respectively, with interest
rates ranging from 0.260 percent to 8.500 percent.
During 2022, our bottling operations in Africa refinanced a portion of its short-term borrowings and issued new long-term debt. This resulted in borrowings of $1,368 million at
a weighted-average interest rate of 5.210 percent as of December 31, 2022.
During 2021, the Company issued fixed interest rate U.S. dollar notes and euro notes of $5,950 million and €3,150 million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from 2028
to 2051 and interest rates ranging from 0.125 percent to 3.000 percent. The carrying value of these notes as of December 31, 2021 was $9,410 million.
During 2021, the Company retired upon maturity variable interest rate euro notes of €371 million with an interest rate equal to the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(“EURIBOR”) plus 0.200 percent.
During 2021, the Company also extinguished prior to maturity fixed interest rate U.S. dollar notes and euro notes of $6,500 million and €2,430 million, respectively, with
maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2026 and interest rates ranging from 0.750 percent to 3.200 percent. These extinguishments resulted in associated charges of $559 million
recorded in the line item interest expense in our consolidated statement of income. These charges included the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying
value of the notes extinguished, including the impact of the related fair value hedging relationships. We also incurred charges of $91 million as a result of the reclassification of
related cash flow hedging balances from AOCI into income.
During 2020, the Company issued fixed interest rate U.S. dollar notes and euro notes of $15,600 million and €2,600 million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from
2025 to 2060 and interest rates ranging from 0.125 percent to 4.200 percent. The carrying value of these notes as of December 31, 2020 was $17,616 million.
During 2020, the Company retired upon maturity fixed interest rate Australian dollar notes and U.S. dollar notes of AUD450 million and $3,750 million, respectively, with
interest rates ranging from 1.875 percent to 3.150 percent. Additionally, the Company retired upon maturity U.S. dollar zero coupon notes of $171 million.
88
During 2020, the Company also extinguished prior to maturity fixed interest rate U.S. dollar notes and euro notes of $3,815 million and €2,300 million, respectively, with
maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2050 and interest rates ranging from 0.000 percent to 4.200 percent. Additionally, the Company extinguished prior to maturity variable
interest rate euro notes of €379 million with a maturity date in 2021 and an interest rate equal to the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.200 percent. These extinguishments resulted
in associated charges of $459 million recorded in the line item interest expense in our consolidated statement of income. These charges included the difference between the
reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the notes extinguished, including the impact of the related fair value hedging relationships. We also incurred charges of $25
million as a result of the reclassification of related cash flow hedging balances from AOCI into income.

NOTE 11: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Guarantees
As of December 31, 2022, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $1,017 million, of which $133 million was related to VIEs. Refer
to Note 1 for additional information related to the Company’s maximum exposure to loss due to our involvement with VIEs. Our guarantees are primarily related to third-party
customers, bottlers and vendors and arose through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually significant.
These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees. However, management has concluded that the
likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.
Legal Contingencies
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings. We establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is
probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is
reasonably possible and/or for which no estimate of possible losses can be made. Management believes that the total liabilities of the Company that may arise as a result of
currently pending legal proceedings (excluding tax audit claims) will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.
Indemnifications
At the time we acquire or divest an ownership interest in an entity, we sometimes agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Management believes
that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of any such indemnification agreements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.
Tax Audits
The Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. These uncertain tax matters may result in the assessment of additional
taxes. Refer to Note 14.
On September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) seeking approximately $3.3
billion of additional federal income tax for years 2007 through 2009. In the Notice, the IRS stated its intent to reallocate over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company
from certain of its foreign affiliates that the U.S. parent company licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in certain non-U.S. markets.
The Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates. IRS rules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-
length pricing of transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates.
To resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the IRS had agreed in 1996 on an arm’s-length methodology for determining
the amount of U.S. taxable income that the U.S. parent company would report as compensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord
in a closing agreement resolving that dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing Agreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances or relevant
federal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the Company would not be assessed penalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation
methodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be used for the 1987 through 1995 tax years.
The IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement methodology in five successive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through
2006.
The September 17, 2015 Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology for the 2007 through 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely
different methodology, without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax calculation methodology, the IRS reallocated over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent
company from its foreign licensees for tax years 2007 through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet to do so.
90
The IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative
means for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly
imposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,
preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.
The Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the
Notice.
Prior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary
judgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.
The trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.
On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid
by the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would
become payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the
Company’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,
2013). The Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co.
opinion to the Company’s case, the Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a final decision, in the Company’s case.
The Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign
licensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different
from that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on
appeal and vigorously defend its position.
In determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting
Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and
regulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our various well-
founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal merits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not
the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the
methodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinion (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final resolution of the litigation. Based on
the required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result
of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the
different tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be
recharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis.
The Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of December 31, 2022. However,
we updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application
of the required probability analysis to these updated calculations and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax reserve as of December 31,
2022 to $423 million.
While the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment
proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax
years 2007 through 2009, and potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows.
The Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the
Opinion, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the
federal courts. This
91
impact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2022 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and for subsequent tax years from 2010 through
2022. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments to the previously accrued transition tax payable under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(“Tax Reform Act”). The Company estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022.
Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. We currently project the continued
application of the Tax Court Methodology in future years, assuming similar facts and circumstances as of December 31, 2022, would result in an incremental annual tax
liability that would increase the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 3.5 percent.
The Company does not know when the Tax Court will issue its opinion regarding the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the Company’s licensee
in Brazil for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. After the Tax Court issues its opinion on the Company’s Brazilian licensee, the Company and the IRS will be provided time to
agree on the tax impact, if any, of both opinions, after which the Tax Court would render a final decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice
of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and pay the tax liability and interest related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years. The Company currently
estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax
and interest liability, would be approximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2022), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of
payment. Some or all of this amount would be refunded if the Company were to prevail on appeal.
Risk Management Programs
The Company has numerous global insurance programs in place to help protect the Company from the risk of loss. In general, we are self-insured for large portions of many
different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company’s risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the
Company’s self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims
history. Our self-insurance reserves totaled $199 million and $229 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
NOTE 12: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
Our Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. The Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan
(“2014 Equity Plan”) was approved by shareowners in April 2014. Under the 2014 Equity Plan, a maximum of 500 million shares of our common stock was approved to be
issued through the grant of equity awards. The 2014 Equity Plan allows for grants of stock options, performance share units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other
specified award types, including cash awards with performance-based vesting criteria. As of December 31, 2022, there were 308 million shares available to be granted under
the 2014 Equity Plan. In addition, there were 3 million shares available for stock option and restricted stock award grants under plans approved by shareowners prior to 2014.
From 2015 to 2017, certain employees who had previously been eligible for long-term equity awards received long-term performance-based cash awards. Employees who
received these performance-based cash awards did not receive equity awards as part of the long-term incentive program. In 2017, the Company changed the long-term incentive
program for employees previously eligible for the performance-based cash award. These employees no longer participate in the long-term incentive program and were granted a
final restricted stock unit award that vests ratably over five years.
Total stock-based compensation expense was $361 million, $337 million and $141 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022, for certain employees who accepted
voluntary separation from the Company as a result of the restructuring of our North America operating unit, the Company provided cash payments designed to offset the loss of
certain equity awards and serve as a cash supplement to employees upon the exercise of certain stock options. In 2020, for certain employees who accepted voluntary separation
from the Company as a result of our strategic realignment initiatives, the Company modified their outstanding equity awards so that the employees retained all or some of their
awards, whereas otherwise the awards would have been forfeited. The incremental stock-based compensation expense in 2022 arising from the cash payments was $5 million,
and the incremental stock-based compensation expense in 2020 arising from the modification of awards was $15 million. These amounts were recorded in the line item other
operating charges in our consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on the Company’s restructuring and strategic realignment initiatives.
The remainder of stock-based compensation expense in 2022 and 2020 of $356 million and $126 million, respectively, and all stock-based compensation expense in 2021 were
recorded in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. The total income tax benefit recognized in our consolidated
statements of income related to total stock-based compensation expense was $55 million, $60 million and $32 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
92
As of December 31, 2022, we had $325 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which
we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years as stock ‑ based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-
based compensation awards.
Stock Option Awards
Stock option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low market prices per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The
fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is
generally four years.
The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-
Scholes-Merton option-pricing model for such grants were as follows:
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020
Fair value of stock options on grant date $ 8.23 $ 5.08 $ 6.44 
Dividend yield 2.8 % 3.3 % 2.7 %
Expected volatility 18.0 % 18.0 % 16.0 %
Risk-free interest rate 1.9 % 0.9 % 1.4 %
Expected term of stock options 6 years 6 years 6 years
The dividend yield is the calculated yield on the closing market price per share of the Company’ s stock on the grant date.
The expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’ s stock, historical volatility of the Company’ s stock and other factors.
The risk-free interest rate for the period matching the expected term of the stock options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in ef fect on the grant date.
The expected term of the stock options represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing historical exercise behavior .
Stock option awards generally expire 10 years after the grant date. The shares of common stock to be issued and/or sold upon the exercise of stock options are made available
from either authorized and unissued common stock or from treasury shares. Since 2007, the Company has issued common stock under its stock-based compensation plans from
treasury shares.
Stock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows:

exercised was 22 million, 19 million and 23 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Performance-Based Share Unit Awards
Performance share unit awards require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are predefined by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors
at the time of grant. For performance share unit awards granted from 2015 through 2017, the performance criteria were economic profit and net operating revenues over a
predefined performance period of three years. Economic profit is our net operating profit after tax less the cost of the capital used in our business. Economic profit and net
operating revenues were adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The purpose of these adjustments was to ensure a
consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. Most of these awards included a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance
share units earned. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined1

performance criteria was reduced or increased if the Company’s total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of
companies fell outside of a predefined range. The fair value of these performance share units was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The performance share unit
awards granted from 2015 through 2017 were subject to a one-year holding period after the performance period before the shares were released.
For performance share unit awards granted from 2018 through 2022, the performance criteria were equally weighted among net operating revenues, earnings per share and free
cash flow over a predefined performance period of three years. For performance share unit awards granted to executives in 2022, the performance criteria were weighted 30
percent for net operating revenues, 30 percent for earnings per share, 30 percent for free cash flow and 10 percent for environmental sustainability. For purposes of these
performance criteria, earnings per share is diluted net income per share; free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and
equipment; and environmental sustainability is comprised of predefined goals related to the Company’s packaging and water security strategies. These performance criteria are
adjusted for certain items, if applicable, which are subject to Audit Committee approval. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of
the specific performance criteria. Performance share unit awards granted to executives include a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance share units
earned. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For these awards, the number of
performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company’s total shareowner return
over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a predefined range. The fair value of performance share units
that do not include a TSR modifier is the closing market price per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received
during the performance period. The performance share unit awards will generally vest at the end of the respective performance period.
During 2021, in addition to granting performance share unit awards with a three-year performance period, the Company granted emerging stronger performance share unit
awards with a predefined performance period of two years. The award’s performance criterion was earnings per share, and the award included a relative TSR modifier. Earnings
per share for these purposes was diluted net income per share adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee. The purpose of these adjustments was
to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the performance criterion. These performance share unit awards generally vested at the end of the two-year performance
period.
For performance share unit awards, in the event the certified results equal the predefined performance criteria, the number of performance share units earned will be equal to
the target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance criteria, additional performance share units up to the maximum award will be earned. In
the event the certified results fall below the predefined performance criteria but are at or above the minimum threshold, a reduced number of performance share units will be
earned. If the certified results fall below the minimum threshold, no performance share units will be earned. Performance share unit awards do not entitle participants to vote or
receive dividends until the performance share units are settled in stock.
In the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit award will be achieved, we recognize
compensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance
share units expected to vest. The remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the vesting
period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all previously
recognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.
Performance share units earned are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such as death or disability, in which case beneficiaries or employees are provided
cash payments. As of December 31, 2022, nonvested performance share units of approximately 1,949,000 and 1,757,000 were outstanding for the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024
performance periods, respectively, based on the target award amounts.

NOTE 13: PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
Our Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans covering certain U.S. employees.
Our Company also sponsors postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering certain U.S. employees. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have
various pension plans and other forms of postretirement benefit arrangements outside the United States.
As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 64 percent and 61 percent of the Company’s consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan
assets, respectively.
Obligations and Funded Status
The following table sets forth the changes in the benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans (in millions):

For pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For other postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The
accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was $ 6,307  million and $ 8,431  million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively .
 An increase in the weighted-average discount rate assumption was the primary driver of net actuarial gain during 2022 and 2021. For our U.S. qualified pension plan, an increase in the discount
rate resulted in an actuarial gain of $ 1,231  million during 2022, and an increase in the discount rate resulted in an actuarial gain of $ 197 million during 2021.  Additional drivers of net actuarial
gain included other assumption updates and plan experience.
Settlements were primarily related to our strategic realignment initiatives. Refer to Note 18.1

 Mutual, pooled and commingled funds include investments in equity securities, fixed-income securities and combinations of both. There are a significant number of mutual, pooled and
commingled funds from which investors can choose. The selection of the type of fund is dictated by the specific investment objectives and needs of a given plan. These objectives and needs vary
greatly between plans.
Fair value disclosures related to our pension plan assets are included in Note 16. Fair value disclosures include, but are not limited to, the levels within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair
value measurements in their entirety fall; a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of Level 3 assets; and information about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure the
fair value of our pension plan assets.
Investment Strategy for U.S. Pension Plan
The Company utilizes the services of investment managers to actively manage the assets of our U.S. qualified pension plan. We have established asset allocation targets and
investment guidelines with each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time
horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the plan. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon a review of the expected return and risk
characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 18 percent equity securities, 47 percent fixed-
income securities and 35 percent alternative investments. We believe this target allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:
(1)optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;
(2)maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and
(3)maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.
The investment guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including
criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Investment managers agree to obtain written
approval for deviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December 31, 2022, no investment manager was responsible for more than 24 percent of total U.S.
pension plan assets.
Our target allocation of 18 percent equity securities is composed of 81 percent global equities, 11 percent emerging market equities and 8 percent domestic small-cap and mid-
cap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. As of
December 31, 2022, investments in our common stock accounted for 9 percent of total global equities and 5 percent of total U.S. pension plan assets. Our investments in global
equities are intended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small-cap and
mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value. Our investments in these asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.
Our target allocation of 47 percent fixed-income securities is composed of 62 percent long-duration bonds and 38 percent with multi-strategy alternative credit managers. Long-
duration bonds are intended to provide a stable rate of return through investments in high-quality publicly traded debt securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are
diversified in order to1
2
1

98
mitigate duration and credit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured credit and emerging market
debt. These investments are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce higher returns compared to long-duration bonds and also help diversify our
overall fixed-income portfolio.
Our target allocation for alternative investments is 35 percent. These alternative investments include hedge funds, reinsurance, private equity limited partnerships, leveraged
buyout funds, international venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of investing in alternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that which
is typically available from publicly traded equity securities. Alternative investments are inherently illiquid and require a long-term perspective in evaluating investment
performance.
Investment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans
The long-term target allocation for 66 percent of our international subsidiaries’ pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European and Canadian plans, is 66 percent equity
securities, 16 percent fixed-income securities and 18 percent other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining 34 percent of the Company’s international subsidiaries’
pension plan assets consisted of 39 percent mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 23 percent fixed-income securities; 2 percent equity securities; and 36 percent other
investments as of December 31, 2022. The investment strategies for our international subsidiaries’ pension plans vary greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local law.
None of our pension plans outside the United States is individually significant for separate disclosure.
Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
Plan assets associated with other postretirement benefits primarily represent funding of one of the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans through a Voluntary Employee
Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”), a tax-qualified trust. The VEBA assets are primarily invested in liquid assets due to the level and timing of expected future benefit
payments.

Total cost (income) $ (124)$ (61)$ (44)$ 5 $ 8 $ 24 
The Company has elected to use the actual fair value of plan assets as the market-related value of plan assets in the determination of the expected return on plan assets.
Actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a corridor approach. The gain/loss corridor is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation and the market-related value of
assets. Gains and losses in excess of the corridor are generally amortized over the average future working lifetime of the plan participants.
Settlement char ges were primarily related to our strategic realignment initiatives. Refer to Note 18 .
All of the amounts in the table above, other than service cost, were recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income.

Assumptions
Certain weighted-average assumptions used in computing the benefit obligations for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were as follows:
Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021
Discount rate 5.50 % 3.00 % 6.00 % 3.25 %
Interest crediting rate 4.00 % 3.00 % N/A N/A
Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.75 % 3.75 % N/A N/A
Certain weighted-average assumptions used in computing net periodic benefit cost or income were as follows:
Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020
Discount rate 3.00 % 2.50 % 3.25 % 3.25 % 2.75 % 3.50 %
Interest crediting rate 3.00 % 3.00 % 3.50 % N/A N/A N/A
Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.75 % 3.75 % 3.75 % N/A N/A N/A
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 7.00 % 7.25 % 7.50 % 4.00 % 4.25 % 4.50 %
The discount rate assumption used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled.
The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities,
are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable
indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other
postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans’ projected benefit cash flows. The rate of compensation increase assumption is
determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.
The cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six-month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous
plan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80 percent for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the
ultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan’s year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest
crediting rate after a period of 10 years.
The expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in
the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the expected long-term rate of return assumption on
an annual basis. The expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2022 net periodic benefit income for the U.S. pension plans was 6.75 percent. As of
December 31, 2022, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return for the U.S. pension plan assets was 4.8 percent, 6.8 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively. The
annualized return since inception was 10.0 percent.
The weighted-average assumptions for health care cost trend rates were as follows:
December 31, 2022 2021
Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 8.25 % 6.75 %
Rate to which the trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate) 5.50 % 5.25 %
Year that the trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2030 2027
We review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. The Company’s U.S. postretirement health
care benefits are primarily provided through plans with either a capped Company cost or a defined-dollar benefit. This limits the effects of health care inflation on the
Company.

Cash Flows
The expected benefit payments for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the 10 years succeeding December 31, 2022 are as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028-2032
Benefit payments for pension plans $ 583 $ 531 $ 545 $ 520 $ 495 $ 2,457 
Benefit payments for other postretirement
   benefit plans 53 51 48 46 43 190 
Total $ 636 $ 582 $ 593 $ 566 $ 538 $ 2,647 
The Company anticipates making contributions of approximately $42 million to our pension trusts in 2023, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. These
contributions are made in accordance with local laws and tax regulations.
Defined Contribution Plans
Our Company sponsors qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the largest U.S. defined contribution plan, we match participants’
contributions up to a maximum of 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent of compensation, subject to an IRS limit on compensation. The Company’s expense for the U.S. plans totaled $45
million, $32 million and $43 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain locations outside the United States. The
Company’s expense for these plans totaled $79 million in both 2022 and 2021 and $63 million in 2020.
Multi-Employer Retirement Plans
The Company participates in various multi-employer retirement plans, which are designed to provide benefits to, or on behalf of, employees of multiple employers. These plans
are typically established under collective bargaining agreements. Multi-employer retirement plans are generally governed by a board of trustees composed of representatives of
both management and labor and are generally funded through employer contributions.
The Company’s expense for multi-employer retirement plans totaled $1 million in both 2022 and 2021 and $2 million in 2020. The plans we currently participate in have
contractual arrangements that extend into 2026. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from any of the multi-employer retirement plans in which we currently participate, we
would record the appropriate withdrawal liability, if any, at that time.

Rica, Singapore and Eswatini. The terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. Tax
incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $406 million, $381 million and $317 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method.
A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows:
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020
Statutory U.S. federal tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %
State and local income taxes — net of federal benefit 1.4 1.1 1.1 
Earnings in jurisdictions taxed at rates different from the statutory U.S.

Equity income or loss (2.7) (2.0) (1.4)
Excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation (0.7) (0.5) (0.8)

Effective tax rate 18.1 % 21.1 % 20.3 %
Includes net tax char ges of $ 375 million (or a 3.0 percent impact on our ef fective tax rate) related to changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions, amounts required to be recorded for
changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, in various international jurisdictions, as well as other discrete items.
Includes a tax benefit of $ 14 million (or a 1.5 percent impact on our ef fective tax rate) associated with the $ 834 million gain recorded upon the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in
BodyArmor . Refer to Note 2.
Includes net tax char ges of $ 110 million (or a 1.1 percent impact on our ef fective tax rate) related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest
and penalties, in various international jurisdictions, as well as other agreed-upon audit issues.
Includes net tax expense of $ 431 million (or a 4.4 percent impact on our ef fective tax rate) primarily related to changes in judgment on specific tax positions due to the Opinion and amounts
required to be recorded for changes to other uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. Also includes a tax benefit of $ 107 million (or a 1.1 percent impact on our ef fective tax rate)
related to changes in our assessment of certain valuation allowances and a net tax benefit of $ 135 million (or a 1.4 percent impact on our ef fective tax rate) related to domestic return to provision
adjustments and other tax items.
Includes a tax benefit of $ 40 million (or a 2.4 percent impact on our ef fective tax rate) associated with the $ 902 million gain recorded upon the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in
fairlife. Refer to Note 2.
As of December 31, 2022, we have not recorded incremental income taxes for additional outside basis differences of $6.8 billion in our investments in foreign subsidiaries, as
these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis
differences in these entities is not practicable.
The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return each foreign subsidiary’s
earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. An accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of GILTI in
the period that is subject to such taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We have elected to
account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that is subject to such tax and the impact is reflected in our full year provision.
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in all applicable jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction, U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions.
U.S. tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for all years prior to 2007. With respect to U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions, with
limited exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2007. For U.S. federal and state tax purposes, the net operating
losses and tax credit carryovers that were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Coca ‑ Cola Enterprises Inc.’s former North America business and that were generated
from 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments until the year in which they are utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always
uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.1 3

On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company’s 2015 litigation with the IRS involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court
predominantly sided with the IRS. The Company disagrees with the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. Refer to Note 11.
As of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $926 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would
be a benefit of $617 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $309 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in
different tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.
A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020
Balance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 906 $ 915 $ 392 
Increase related to prior period tax positions 6 9 528 
Decrease related to prior period tax positions — (50) (1)
Increase related to current period tax positions 38 37 26 
Decrease related to settlements with taxing authorities (2) (4) (19)
Effect of foreign currency translation (22) (1) (11)
Balance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 926 $ 906 $ 915 
The increase was primarily related to a change in judgment on certain tax positions due to the Opinion. Refer to Note 1 1.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. The Company had
$496 million, $453 million and $391 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of
these amounts, expense of $43 million, $62 million and $190 million was recognized in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax
positions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company’s effective tax rate.
It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect any changes will have a significant impact on our
consolidated statement of income or consolidated balance sheet. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, statute of limitations expiring or final
settlements in transfer pricing matters that are the subject of litigation. Currently, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.1

The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):
December 31, 2022 2021
Deferred tax assets:   
Property, plant and equipment $ 40 $ 36 
Trademarks and other intangible assets 1,617 1,910

Other (211) (164)
Total deferred tax liabilities $ (5,777)$ (5,629)
Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ (1,168)$ (692)
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net deferred tax assets of $398 million and $657 million, respectively, located in countries outside the United States.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $1,605 million of loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Loss carryforwards of $322 million must be utilized within
the next five years, and the remainder can be utilized over a period greater than five years.
An analysis of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances is as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020
Balance at beginning of year $ 401 $ 406 $ 303 
Additions 47 25 240 
Deductions (24) (30) (137)
Balance at end of year $ 424 $ 401 $ 406 
The Company’s deferred tax asset valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss
carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions and basis differences in certain equity investments. Current evidence does not
suggest that we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to
identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future,
it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to
realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet.
In 2022, the Company recognized a net increase of $23 million in its valuation allowances. The increase was primarily due to significant negative evidence on the utilization of
excess foreign tax credits generated in the current year. The increase was also due to net increases in the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity
investments and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business.
105
In 2021, the Company recognized a net decrease of $5 million in its valuation allowances. The decrease was primarily due to net decreases in the deferred tax assets and related
valuation allowances on certain equity investments and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business.
In 2020, the Company recognized a net increase of $103 million in its valuation allowances. The increase was primarily due to net increases in the deferred tax assets and
related valuation allowances on certain equity investments. The increase was also due to the increase of valuation allowances after considering significant negative evidence on
the utilization of certain net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits.

NOTE 16: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market
for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based
on a three-level hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used
to measure fair value are as follows:
•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. We value assets and liabilities included in this level using dealer and broker quotations,
certain pricing models, bid prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data.
•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain
pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.1
1 
109
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. For our Company, the only assets and liabilities that
are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale,
derivative financial instruments and our contingent consideration liability. Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the
Company’s fair value hedging strategy.
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
The fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of the balance
sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar
instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, benchmark yields,
broker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the
closing contract prices as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.
The fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily
available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation
models for derivative instruments other than futures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard
valuation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied
volatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.
Included in the fair values of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The adjustment is based on current credit default swap (“CDS”) rates applied to
each contract, by counterparty. We use our counterparty’s CDS rate when we are in an asset position and our own CDS rate when we are in a liability position. The adjustment
for nonperformance risk did not have a significant impact on the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments.

significant for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required
by U.S. GAAP. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges or as a result of observable changes in equity securities
using the measurement alternative.7

The Company recorded an other -than-temporary impairment char ge of $ 96 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to an equity method investee in Russia. This impairment
charge was derived using Level 3 inputs and was primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment char ge of $ 57 million related to a trademark in Asia Pacific, which was primarily driven by a change in brand
strategy resulting in revised projections of future operating results for the trademark. The fair value of this trademark was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level 3 inputs.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a net loss of $ 24 million on assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The net loss was recorded as a result of an equity
method investee issuing additional shares of its stock. Accordingly , the Company is required to treat this type of transaction as if the Company had sold a proportionate share of its investment.
This net loss was determined using Level 2 inputs and primarily resulted from the recognition of cumulative translation losses.
The Company is required to record assets and liabilities that are held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell based on the agreed-upon sale price. The Company
recorded char ges of $ 266 million in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United
States. These char ges, which were calculated based on Level 3 inputs, primarily impacted the line item property , plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet.
The Company recorded an impairment char ge of $ 78 million related to a trademark in Europe, which was driven by a change in the long-term outlook on the licensing arrangement for a certain
brand. The fair value of this trademark was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level 3 inputs.
Fair Value Measurements for Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
The fair value hierarchy discussed above is not only applicable to assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet but is also applied to certain other
assets that impact our consolidated financial statements. For example, our Company sponsors a number of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Assets contributed to
these plans by the Company become the property of the individual plans. Even though the Company no longer has control over these assets, our consolidated financial
statements are impacted by subsequent fair value adjustments to these assets. The actual return on these assets impacts the Company’s future net periodic benefit cost or income
as well as amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 13. The Company uses the fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of assets held by our
pension and other postretirement benefit plans.4

In August 2020, the Company announced strategic steps to transform our organizational structure in an effort to better enable us to capture growth in the fast-changing
marketplace. The Company has transformed into a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep knowledge required to win locally. We
created new operating units effective January 1, 2021, which are focused on regional and local execution. The operating units sit under our four geographic operating segments
and are highly interconnected, with the goal of eliminating duplication of resources and scaling new products more quickly. The operating units work closely with five global
marketing category leadership teams to rapidly scale ideas while staying close to the consumer. The global marketing category leadership teams primarily focus on innovation
as well as marketing efficiency and effectiveness. The organizational structure also includes a center and a platform services organization. Refer to Note 19 for additional

and scaled global services and capabilities, including, but not limited to, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and social/digital hubs.
Segment Products and Services
The business of our Company is primarily nonalcoholic beverages. Our geographic operating segments (Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; and
Asia Pacific) derive a majority of their revenues from the manufacture and sale of beverage concentrates and syrups and, in some cases, the sale of finished beverages. Our
Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and doğadan businesses as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements
between the Company and Monster. Our Bottling Investments operating segment is composed of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of the geographic location of
the bottler. Our Bottling Investments operating segment also includes equity income from the majority of our equity method investees. Our consolidated bottling operations
derive the majority of their revenues from the manufacture and sale of finished beverages. Generally, finished product operations produce higher net operating revenues but
lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. Refer to Note 3.
The following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:

Method of Determining Segment Income or Loss
Management evaluates the performance of our operating segments separately to individually monitor the different factors affecting financial performance. Our Company
manages income taxes and certain treasury-related items, such as interest income and interest expense, on a global basis within Corporate. We evaluate operating segment
performance based primarily on net operating revenues and operating income (loss).

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include
certain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. Financial information in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control system is supported by a program of internal audits and
appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Business Conduct adopted by
our Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. In addition, our Company’s Board of Directors adopted a written
Code of Business Conduct for Non-Employee Directors which reflects the same principles and values as our Code of Business Conduct for officers and employees but focuses
on matters of relevance to non-employee Directors.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only
provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework)
(“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022.
The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors,
subject to ratification by our Company’s shareowners. Ernst & Young LLP has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of The Coca-Cola Company and
subsidiaries and the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors are contained in this report.
Audit Committee’s Responsibility
The Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are independent in accordance with the requirements of the New York Stock
Exchange listing standards, the Exchange Act, and the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors
periodically to discuss internal controls along with auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results
of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present to ensure that the
independent auditors and the chief internal auditor have free access to the Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee’s Report can be found in the Company’s 2023 Proxy
Statement.

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company
    
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, shareo wners’  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the “consolidated financ ial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022
and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022, based on criteria establishe d in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for  Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’ s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’ s financial statements based on our audits. We are a
public accoun ting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted  our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included perform ing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evalu ating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements  and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated finan cial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below , providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Accounting for uncertain tax positions
Description of the
MatterAs described in Note 11 and Note 14 to the Company’ s consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various income tax matters for which the ultimate
outcomes are uncertain. As of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $926 million. As described in Note 11, on September 17, 2015 the
Company received a Statut ory Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $3.3 billion for the period. On
November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion predominantly siding with the IRS related to the Company’ s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company
and certain of its foreign af filiates for tax years 2007 through 2009.
While the Company continues to disagree with the IRS positions and the portions of the opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the
adjustment proposed by the IRS could ultimately be upheld. As a result of the application of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company has recorded a tax
reserve of $423 million for this matter as of December 31, 2022.
Auditing management’ s evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including the uncertain tax position associated with the IRS notice and opinion, was especially challenging
due to the level of subjectivity and significant judgment associated with the recognition and measurement of the tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained.
126
How W e Addr essed the
Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design , and tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’ s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. Our
procedures included testing controls addressing the completeness of uncertain tax positions, controls relating to the identification and recognition of the uncertain tax
positions, controls over the measurement of the unrecognized tax benefit, and controls over the identification of developments related to existing uncertain tax positions.
Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions the Company used to assess its uncertain tax positions and related unrecognized tax benefit
amounts by jurisdiction. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. We
evaluated evidence of management’ s assessment of the opinion, including inquiries of tax counsel, inspection of technical memos, and written representations of
management. We involved professionals with speci alized skill and knowledge to assist in our evaluation of the tax technical merits of the Company’ s assessment,
including the assessment of whether the tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, the amoun t of the potential benefits to be realized, and the application of
relevant tax law . We also assessed the Company’ s disclosure of uncertain tax positions included in Note 1 1 and Note 14.
Valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill
Description of the
MatterAs described in Note 1 to the Company’ s consolida ted financial statements, the Company performs an annual impairment test of its indefinite-lived intangible assets,
including trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Each impairment test may be
qualitative or quantitative. Trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill were $14.2 billion and $18.8 billion, respectively , as of December 31, 2022.
Auditing the valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill involved complex judgment due to the significant estimation required in
determining the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and related reporting units with goodwill, respectively . Specifically , the fair value estimates were
sensitive to significant assumptions about future market and economic conditions. Significant assumptions used in the Company’ s fair value estimates included sales
volume, pricing, royalty rates, long-term growth rates, and cost of capital, as applicable.
How W e Addr essed the
Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design,  and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’ s annual impairment tests for trademarks with
indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill. For example, we tested management’ s risk assessment process to determine whether to perform a quantitative or
qualitative test and manage ment’ s review controls over the valuation models and underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates. For impairment tests of reporting
units with goodwill, we also tested controls over the determination of the carrying value of the reporting units. We tested the estimated fair values of the trademarks with
indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill based on our risk assessments.
Our audit procedures inclu ded, among others, compar ing significant judgmental inputs to observable third party and industry sources, considering other observable market
transactions, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’ s projected financial information by comparing to third party industry projections, third party economic
growth projec tions, and other internal and external data. We performed sensitivity analyses of certain significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the
trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill and also assessed the historical accuracy of management’ s estimates. In addition, we involved specialists
to assist in our evaluation of certain significant assumptions used in the Company’ s discounted cash flow analyses. We also assessed the Company’ s disclosure of its
annual impairment tests included in Note 1.

Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries

December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareowners’  equity , and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for  Opinion
The Company ’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management’ s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accoun ting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted  our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol over  Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A compan y’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenan ce of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transact ions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit prepa ration of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the compan y; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
