Our
 principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is thelargest seller of
 athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores, internet websites, and mobile applications(which
 we refer to collectively as our “Direct to Consumer” or “DTC” operations), and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world. Virtually allof
 our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products areproduced both in the United States and abroad.
Products
 
We
 focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in nine key categories: Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Men’s Training, Women’s Training, ActionSports,
 Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products) and Golf. Men's Training includes our baseball and American football product offerings. We also market productsdesigned for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket, lacrosse, tennis, volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activities.
NIKE’s athletic footwea
r products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We placeconsiderable
 emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand arecurrently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales.
We
 also  sell  sports  apparel  covering  the  above-mentioned  categories,  which  feature  the  same  trademarks  and  are  sold  predominantly  through  the  same  marketing  anddistribution
 channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment toinnovation
 and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Men’s Training and Running are currently our top-selling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead inapparel
 sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professionalteam and league logos.
We
 sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves,protective
 equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.
Our Jordan
 Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark.Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.
One
 of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel andaccessories
 under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley products are included within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segmentwith sales reported within the Action Sports category.
Another
 of  our  wholly-owned  subsidiary  brands,  Converse,  headquartered  in  Boston,  Massachusetts,  designs,  distributes  and  licenses  casual  sneakers,  apparel  andaccessories
 under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on astand-alone basis.
In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our DTC operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit
unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.

Financial
 information  about  geographic  and  segment  operations  appears  in Note  17  —  Operating  Segments  and  Related  Information of  the  accompanying  Notes  to  theConsolidated Financial Statements.
We experience
 moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in thesecond
 and  third  quarters.  However,  the  mix  of  product  sales  may  vary  considerably  as  a  result  of  changes  in  seasonal  and  geographic  demand  for  particular  types  offootwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors.
Because
 NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products.We
 must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categoriesand
 influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on oursales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We
 report  our  NIKE  Brand  operations  based  on  our  internal  geographic  organization.  Each  NIKE  Brand  geography  operates  predominantly  in  one  industry:  the  design,development,
 marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. For fiscal 2017, our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brandare:
 North  America,  Western  Europe,  Central  &  Eastern  Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Emerging  Markets. In  June  2017,  we  announced  a  new  company  alignmentdesigned
 to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational realignment, beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company's reportableoperating
 segments for the NIKE Brand will be: North America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific and Latin America. Our  NIKE Brand Direct toConsumer operations are, and will continue to be, managed within each geographic operating segment.
Converse
 is,  and  will  continue  to  be,  a  reportable  segment  and  operates  in  one  industry:  the  design,  marketing,  licensing  and  selling  of  casual  sneakers,  apparel  andaccessories. Converse Direct to Consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results.
United States Market
For 
fiscal 2017 , NIKE Brand and  Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 46% of total revenues, compared to 47% and 46% for fiscal 2016 and fiscal2015 
,  respectively. We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwearstores,
 sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE salesoffices to solicit such sales. During 
fiscal 2017 , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 23% of sales in the United States. Our
 Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to consumers through our digital commerce website, www.nike.com and through mobile applications. In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States:
U.S. Retail Stores
Number NIKE Brand factory stores
209 NIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores)
34 Converse stores (including factory stores)
112 Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores)

 the United States, NIKE has six significant distribution centers located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and four of which are leased. NIKE Brand appareland
 equipment  products  are  also  shipped  from  our  leased  Foothill  Ranch,  California  distribution  center.  Converse  and  Hurley  products  are  shipped  primarily  from  leasedfacilities in Ontario, California, as well as from Memphis, Tennessee. Smaller leased distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States.
We
 also operate a futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be deliveredwithin
 a set time period at a fixed price. For fiscal  2017 ,  orders under the futures program represented 83% of  our U.S. wholesale footwear revenues, compared to 84% for fiscal
 2016 and 87% for fiscal 2015 .  For fiscal  2017 ,  futures orders represented 66% of  our U.S. wholesale apparel revenues, compared to 66% for fiscal 2016 and 67% for fiscal 2015 
. International Markets
For 
fiscal 2017 ,  non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for 54% of  total revenues, compared to 53% and 54% for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively. We sell
 our products to retail accounts, through our own Direct to Consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives aroundthe world. We sell to
 thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 60 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada,Asia,
 Europe and some Latin American countries, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above.During 
fiscal 2017 , NIKE’s three largest customers outside of the United States  accounted for approximately 12% of total non-U.S. sales. 2

Significant Customer
No 
customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net revenues during fiscal 2017 . Orders
Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2017 were $14.7
 billion compared to $15.0 billion for the same periodlast
 year. NIKE Brand futures orders include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operationswhich
 are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon ourinternal
 forecast of the actual currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative ofour
 expectation of revenues for this period and have become less correlated due to our evolving business model. This is due to year-over-year changes  in shipment timing,changes in 
the  mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. Inaddition, foreign
 currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons betweenfutures
 orders  and actual  revenues.  A portion  of our revenue  is not  derived  from futures  orders,  including  sales  with short lead times,  closeout  NIKE  Brand  footwear  andapparel,
 all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and salesfrom Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley.
Product Research, Design and Development
We
 believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, appareland
 athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort whilereducing waste.
In
 addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we alsoutilize
 research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with usand
 review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employeeathletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate
 products during the design and development process.As
 we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our productcategories. Using market
 intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumerpreferences.
 The  proliferation  of  NIKE  Air,  Lunar,  Zoom,  Free,  Flywire,  Dri-Fit,  Flyknit,  Flyweave,  ZoomX,  React  and  NIKE+  technologies  throughout  our  Running,  NIKEBasketball,
 the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Men's Training, Women's Training and Sportswear categories, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovativeproducts.
Manufacturing
We
 are supplied by approximately 127 footwear factories located in 15 countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 8% of total fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand
 footwear  production.  Virtually  all  of  our  footwear  is  manufactured  outside  of  the  United  States  by  independent  contract  manufacturers  who  often  operate  multiplefactories. For 
fiscal 2017 ,  contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 46%, 27% and 21% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. Wealso
 have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina, India, Brazil, Mexico and Italy to manufacture footwear for sale primarily withinthose
 countries.  For fiscal  2017 , five footwear  contract  manufacturers  each  accounted  for  greater  than  10%  of  footwear  production  and  in  the  aggregate  accounted  forapproximately 
69% of NIKE Brand footwear production. We
 are supplied by approximately 363 apparel factories located in 37 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 13% of  total fiscal  2017 NIKE Brand
 apparel  production.  Virtually  all  of  our  apparel  is  manufactured  outside  of  the  United  States  by  independent  contract  manufacturers  which  often  operate  multiplefactories. For 
fiscal 2017 ,  contract factories in China, Vietnam and Thailand produced approximately 26%, 16% and 10% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2017 
, one apparel  contract  manufacturer  accounted  for  more  than  10%  of  apparel  production,  and  the  top  five  contract  manufacturers  in  the  aggregate  accounted  forapproximately 
43% of NIKE Brand apparel production. 3

Table of ContentsThe
 principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon,polyester
 and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2017 ,  Air Manufacturing Innovation, with facilities nearBeaverton,
 Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our suppliers of the Air-Sole cushioning components used infootwear.
 The  principal  materials  used  in  our  apparel  products  are  natural  and  synthetic  fabrics  and  threads  (both  virgin  and  recycled);  specialized  performance  fabricsdesigned
 to  efficiently  wick  moisture  away  from  the  body,  retain  heat  and  repel  rain  and/or  snow;  and  plastic  and  metal  hardware.  NIKE’s  independent  contractors  andsuppliers
 buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independentcontractors
 and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficultyin satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products.
Since
 1972,  Sojitz  Corporation  of  America  (“Sojitz  America”),  a  large  Japanese  trading  company  and  the  sole  owner  of  our  redeemable  preferred  stock,  has  performedsignificant
 import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2017 ,  Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKEmarkets including Argentina, Brazi
l, Canada, India, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 6% of NIKEBrand
 sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquireproducts
 from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales andprofitability.
 However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates.Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2018 and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to May 31, 2019.
International Operations and Trade
Our
 international  operations  and  sources  of  supply  are  subject  to  the  usual  risks  of  doing  business  abroad,  such  as  possible  increases  in  import  duties,  anti-dumpingmeasures,
 quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not,to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot
 predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future.In
 recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. Thesetrends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing
trade
 protectionism  in many  different  regions,  and  in nearly  all cases  we  are working  together  with  industry  groups  to  address  trade  issues  and reduce  the  impact  to theindustry,
 while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additionalmeasures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.
We
 monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes tomitigate trade
 restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for andadvocating
 against  other  impediments  that  may limit or delay  customs  clearance  for imports  of footwear,  apparel  and equipment.  Current U.S.  policy proposals, includingpotential
 tariffs or penalties on imported goods, if enacted, may negatively affect U.S. corporations with production activities outside the U.S., including NIKE. There have alsobeen
 discussions and commentary regarding potential changes to U.S. trade policies. If any of these reforms are implemented, it may become necessary for us to change theway
 we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition ,  with respect to trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an importantsourcing
 country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to helpensure
 that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considersChina's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community.
Where
 trade  protection  measures  are  implemented,  we  believe  that  we  have  the  ability  to  develop,  over  a  period  of  time,  adequate  alternative  sources  of  supply  for  theproducts
 obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarilydisrupted
 and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supplywould, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be
 as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.NIKE advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements.
Competition
The
 athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisurefootwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel
and
 equipment,  including  adidas,  ASICS,  Li  Ning,  lululemon  athletica,  Puma,  Under  Armour  and  V.F.  Corporation,  among  others.  The  intense  competition  and  the  rapidchanges
 in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in ouroperations.
NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of
 competition in this industry are:•
Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value. •
Consumer  connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction;  customer support and service;identification
 with prominent and influential athletes, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products andactive engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics.
•
Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and online. We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.

Table of ContentsTrademarks and Patents
We
 believe that our intellectual  property rights are important to our brand, our success,  and our competitive  position. We pursue available protections  of these rights andvigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement.
We
 utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, inidentifying
 our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh trademarks to be among our mostvaluable
 assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing ourproducts.
 We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademarkregistrations.
We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. In some instances, we also obtain registered copyrights.
We own patents and have a patent license, facilitating our use of “Air” technologies.
We
 file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign design patents protecting components, technologies, manufacturingtechniques,
 features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, athletic equipment and digital devices. These patents expire at varioustimes.
We
 believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patentand trade secret positions.
However,
 we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and select foreign countries on inventions, designs and improvements that we deemvaluable. We also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against third-party infringement.
Employees
As
 of May  31, 2017 ,  we had approximately 74,400 employees  worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees tobe
 excellent. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employeesto
 be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitledto
 information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter intoand/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.

Certain
 written  and  oral  statements,  other  than  purely  historic  information,  including  estimates,  projections,  statements  relating  to  NIKE’s  business  plans,  objectives  andexpected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or
 incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives inthis report, other
 reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities LitigationReform
 Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that maypredict,

 “will  likely  result”  or  words  or  phrases  of  similar  meaning.  Forward-looking  statements  involve  risks  and  uncertainties  which  may  cause  actual  results  to  differmateriall
y from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms8-K,
 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overallathletic
 footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment forconsumers
 and  endorsers;  demographic  changes;  changes  in  consumer  preferences;  popularity  of  particular  designs,  categories  of  products  and  sports;  seasonal  andgeographic dem
and for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the various marketfactors
 described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKE’s increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, thesystems
 related to demand and supply planning  and inventory control;  interruptions  in data and information  technology  systems;  consumer  data security;  fluctuations  anddifficulty
 in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipmenttiming,
 the changing mix of futures and orders with shorter lead times, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast itsgrowth
 and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE’s products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; newproduct
 development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service;adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to

 doing business outside of the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability andterrorism;
 proposed changes to U.S. tax laws or policy, tariff and import/export regulations; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legaldevelopments
 relating  to,  climate  change  and  natural  disasters;  litigation,  regulatory  proceedings  and  other  claims  asserted  against  NIKE;  the  ability  to  attract  and  retainqualified personnel; the effects of NIKE’s decision to invest in or divest of
 businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports.The risks included here ar
e not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE’s business and financial performance.Moreover, NIKE operates
 in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all suchrisks, nor can
 it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKE’s business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially fromthose
 contained  in  any  forward-looking  statements.  Given  these  risks  and  uncertainties,  investors  should  not  place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking  statements  as  aprediction of actual results.
Investors
 should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE’s policy to disclose to them any material non-public
 information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by anyanalyst
 irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others.Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts con
tain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.Our products face intense competition.
NIKE
 is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. Theathletic footwear, appar
el and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athleticand
 leisure  footwear  companies,  athletic  and leisure  apparel  companies,  sports  equipment  companies  and large companies  having  diversified  lines of  athletic  and leisurefootwear,
 apparel  and  equipment.  We  also  compete  with  other  companies  for  the  production  capacity  of  independent  manufacturers  that  produce  our  products.  Our  DTCoperations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers selling our products.
Product
 offerings,  technologies,  marketing  expenditures  (including  expenditures  for  advertising  and  endorsements),  pricing,  costs  of  production,  customer  service,  digitalcommerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in
 technology and consumer preferences in the markets forathletic
 and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail including shiftsin
 the ways in which consumers are shopping, and the rising trend of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our DTC and wholesale operations. If we do notadequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly.
Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business.
Our
 iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting andgrowing
 our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitmentto
 product  innovation  and  quality  and  our  continuing  investment  in  design  (including  materials)  and  marketing  may  not  have  the  desired  impact  on  our  brand  image  andreputation.
 We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negativepublicity.
 In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence inus and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations.
In
 addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including ourincreasing
 reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking applications or websitescould
 seriously damage our reputation and brand image. If we do not maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results ofoperations could be materially and adversely affected.

Table of ContentsIf
 we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenuesand profits.
Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate,
 gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner.However,
 lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of ourproducts
 are  subject  to  changing  consumer  preferences  that  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  Our  new  products  may  not  receive  consumer  acceptance  as  consumerpreferences could shift rapidly to
 different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our abilityto anticipate and respond
 to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing productofferings,
 developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lowersales,
 excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market ourproducts globally
 through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If wedo
 not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.
We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our
 products.Technical
 innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of ourproducts.
 Research  and  development  play  a  key  role  in  technical  innovation.  We  rely  upon  specialists  in  the  fields  of  biomechanics,  chemistry,  exercise  physiology,engineering,
 industrial  design,  sustainability  and  related  fields,  as  well  as  research  committees  and  advisory  boards  made  up  of  athletes,  coaches,  trainers,  equipmentmanagers, orthopedist
s, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athleticperformance,
 reduce injury and maximize comfort,  if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products,  consumer demand for our products could decline, and if weexperience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems.
Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-qual
ity endorsers of our products could harm our business.We
 establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well asestablish
 product authenticity with consumers. However,  as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorshipsand other
 relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or todo
 so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increaseour marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed.
Furthermore,
 if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actionstaken
 by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or endorsers, could alsoseriously
 harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by ourendorsers,
 a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, or public figures, to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsementarrangements with prominent athletes, public figures, and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.
A
 majority  of  our  products  are  manufactured  and  sold  outside  of  the  United  States.  As  a  result,  we  conduct  purchase  and  sale  transactions  in  various  currencies,  whichincreases
 our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange ratesas
 a result of the United Kingdom's impending exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit” and current U.S. policy proposals. Our international revenuesand
 expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specificallyamounts
 recorded  in  foreign  currencies  and  translated  into  U.S.  Dollars  for  consolidated  financial  reporting,  as  weakening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  Dollaradversely
 affects  the  U.S.  Dollar  value  of  the  Company's  foreign  currency-denominated  sales  and  earnings.  Currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations  could  also  disrupt  thebusiness
 of  the  independent  manufacturers  that  produce  our  products  by  making  their  purchases  of  raw  materials  more  expensive  and  more  difficult  to  finance.  Foreigncurrency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effec
t on our results of operations and financial condition.We
 may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results.Since
 the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reducethe
 positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to theforeign curren
cies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.8

Table of ContentsGlobal economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
The
 uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economicand
 financial  market  conditions  do  not  improve  or  deteriorate,  the  following  factors  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  operating  results  and  financialcondition:
•
Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higherdiscounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins.
•
In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.•
We  conduct  transactions  in  various  currencies,  which  increases  our  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  relative  to  the  U.S.  Dollar.  Continuedvolatility
 in  the  markets  and  exchange  rates  for  foreign  currencies  and  contracts  in  foreign  currencies,  including  in  response  to  certain  policies  advocated  by  the  U.S.presidential administration, could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition.
•
Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives)could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability.
•
If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this couldresult
 in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greaterexpense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.
•
If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of ourproducts to consumers.
•
If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase rawmaterials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.
Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.
We experience
 moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in thesecond
 and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand forparticular
 types  of  footwear,  apparel  and  equipment  and  in  connection  with  the  timing  of  significant  sporting  events,  such  as  the  Olympics  or  the  European  FootballChampionsh
ip, among others. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result,we
 may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality,along with other factors that are beyond our control, incl
uding general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas,transportation
 disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating marginsare
 also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographicsales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of 
the results to be expected for any future period.Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues.
We utilize a futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set
period
 of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fillcustomer
 orders  and  the  risk  of  non-delivery.  We  currently  report  changes  in  futures  orders  in  our  periodic  financial  reports.  Reported  futures  orders  are  not  necessarilyindicative
 of  our  expectation  of  revenues  for  any  future  period,  and  the  relationship  between  reported  futures  and  reported  revenues  in  a  given  period  has  become  lesscorrelated
 over time based on our evolving business model. Differences are also due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders betweenfutures
 and orders with shorter lead times and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchangerate fluctuations, as well as differing levels of order
 cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues.Moreover, a portion
 of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales with short lead times, closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brandequipment, the
 difference between retail sales and internal orders from our Direct to Consumer in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKEGolf and Hurley.
Our
 futures  ordering  program  does  not  prevent  excess  inventories  or  inventory  shortages,  which  could  result  in  decreased  operatingmargins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business.
We
 purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers.There is
 a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, andthe
 sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cashflows.
 Conversely,  if  we  underestimate  consumer  demand  for  our  products  or  if  our  manufacturers  fail  to  supply  products  we  require  at  the  time  we  need  them,  we  mayexperience inventory shortages. Inventory
 shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brandloyalty.
The
 difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure toaccurately
 predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certaintyin advance.

Table of ContentsWe may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.
We
 extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of productionand
 the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. Theseadvance
 orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling witheconomic uncertainty. In
 the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, ourability
 to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. Aslowing
 or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations
 and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers,which
 requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales andorders for our products.
Consolidation
 of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk andimpair our ability to sell products.
The
 athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with manystores.
 These retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate ourcredit
 risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditionalretail,
 it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in aparticular
 country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number ofother retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues.
Our Direct
 to Consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources andare subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.
Our
 Direct to Consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We haveentered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness
and
 marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the highfixed-cost structu
re associated with our Direct to Consumer operations, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure or poorperformance of individual or
 multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.Many factors
 unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company’s control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud;mismanagement
 of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions inthe areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business.
If
 the  technology-based  systems  that  give  our  customers  the  ability  to  shop  with  us  online  do  not  function  effectively,  our  operatingresults, as well as our ability to grow our digi
tal commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.Many of
 our customers shop with us through our digital commerce website and mobile applications. Increasingly, customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop onlinewith us and with our competitors and to do compar
ison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers andas
 a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wideassortment
 of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage,result
 in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce businessglobally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Risks specific
 to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experiencethrough
 direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as wellas damage our reputation and brands.
Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.
We periodically discove
r products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcingour
 intellectual property, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from ourproducts.
The
 actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable toprevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights.
We
 may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also
 may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importationand/or sale of certain products.
We
 take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. Such actions include contractualmeasures
 such  as  entering  into  non-disclosure  and  non-compete  agreements  and  agreements  relating  to  our  collaborations  with  third  parties,  and  providing  confidentialinformation
 awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might notalways
 be effective. For example, confidential information that is related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results orpersonal data
 could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our marketposition, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions.

Table of ContentsIn
 addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may facesignificant
 expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfullyprotect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.
We are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.
We
 currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail tosuccessfully
 market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships,supplier
 relationships  or  credit  risks,  it  could  adversely  affect  our  revenues,  both  directly  from  reduced  royalties  received  and  indirectly  from  reduced  sales  of  our  otherproducts.
We
 also  rely  on  our  licensees  to  help  preserve  the  value  of  our  brands.  Although  we  attempt  to  protect  our  brands  through  approval  rights  over  the  design,  productionprocesses,
 quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands byour licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on 
that brand and on us. We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation.

 addition  to  our  own  sensitive  and  proprietary  business  information,  we  collect  transactional  and  personal  information  about  our  customers  and  users  of  our  digitalexperiences,
 which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticatedand
 operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network, or vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data,misappropriation
 of our consumers’, users' or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect onour
 business, including, unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation and result in lost sales and consumers,fines, or lawsuits. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to
 and/or redress problems caused by any breach.In
 addition,  we  must  comply  with  increasingly  complex  and  rigorous  regulatory  standards  enacted  to  protect  business  and  personal  data.  Compliance  with  existing  andproposed
 laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure tosecure personal informat
ion could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage toour reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.
Failure
 of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harmour business.
We
 work  with  hundreds  of  contractors  outside  of  the  United  States  to  manufacture  our  products,  and  we  also  have  license  agreements  that  permit  unaffiliated  parties  tomanufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors tha
t directly manufacture our products and our licensees thatmake
 products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safetystandards
 for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations,from
 time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on theircontractors.
 Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as aresult, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition.
Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our
 business.Virtually
 all  of  our  athletic  footwear  and  apparel  is  manufactured  outside  of  the  United  States,  and  the  majority  of  our  products  are  sold  outside  of  the  United  States.Accordingly,
 we  are  subject  to  the  risks  generally  associated  with  global  trade  and  doing  business  abroad,  which  include  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  varying  consumerpreferences across geographic regions, political unrest,
 disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our productsare
 manufactured  or  where  we  sell  products.  This  includes,  for  example,  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  effect  of  Brexit,  including  changes  to  the  legal  and  regulatoryframework
 that  apply  to  the  United  Kingdom  and  its  relationship  with  the  European  Union,  as  well  as  the  current  proposals  affecting  trade  policy  in  the  U.S.  The  U.S.presidential
 administration  has  indicated  a  focus  on  policy  reforms  that  discourage  U.S.  corporations  from  outsourcing  manufacturing  and  production  activities  to  foreignjurisdictions, including through potential tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S. If any o
f these reforms are implemented, it may become necessary for us tochange
 the  way  we  conduct  business  which  may  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations.  The  administration  has  also  targeted  the  specific  practices  of  certain  U.S.multinational corporations in public statements which, if directed at us, could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.
In
 addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability tomanufacture
 products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these orother
 factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our importedproducts
 are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country inwhich
 our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to preventterrorism,
 restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverseeffect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Table of ContentsWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or additional 
tax liabilities.We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and
 numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including theUnited
 States, subject to significant change. There have been proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporationsare
 taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, couldhave
 an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of thosejurisdictions.
 If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective income taxrates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted.
Portions
 of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. These taxholidays and
 rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if wefail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate,
 our effective income tax rate would increase in the future.We
 are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood ofan
 adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, thefinal
 determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or relateddisputes
 could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and oursubsidiaries
 are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of thesetransactions
 and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impactour mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates.
Proposed
 changes  to  U.S.  tax  law  or  policy,  tariff  and  import/export  regulations  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,financial condition and results of operations.
During,
 and  following,  the  recent  U.S.  presidential  election,  there  has  been  discussion  and  commentary  regarding  potential  significant  changes  to  U.S.  trade  policies,legislation,
 treaties  and  tariffs,  including  NAFTA  and  trade  policies  and  tariffs  affecting  China.  There  have  also  been  discussions  of  a  disallowance  of  tax  deductions  forimported
 merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products. It is unknown at this time whether and to what extent new legislation will be passed into law,pending
 or  new regulatory  proposals  will be  adopted,  international  trade  agreements  will be  negotiated,  or the  effect  that  any  such  action  would have,  either  positively  ornegatively,
 on our industry, or on us. The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by thesechanges.
 If any new legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated, it may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alterour
 business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations.
If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions defaul
t on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.As
 part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, optioncontracts,
 collars  and  swaps  with  various  financial  institutions.  In  addition,  we  have  significant  amounts  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  other  investments  on  deposit  or  inaccounts
 with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financialinstitutions.
 The  risk  of  counterparty  default  or  failure  may  be  heightened  during  economic  downturns  and  periods  of  uncertainty  in  the  financial  markets.  If  one  of  ourcounterparties
 were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accountswith such counterpa
rty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failureof one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products.
NIKE is supplied by approximately 
127 footwear factories located in 15 countries. We do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend uponindependent
 contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 2017 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than10%
 of  fiscal 2017 footwear  production  and  in  aggregate  accounted  for  approximately 69% of  NIKE  Brand  footwear  production  in  fiscal 2017 .  Our  ability  to  meet  ourcustomers'
 needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers wereto
 sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have amaterial
 adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do notmeet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.
The
 principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture awayfrom
 the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principalmaterials
 used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and syntheticfabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon 
the abilityof
 our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wagerates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the coun
tries in which our products are manufactured.12

Table of ContentsThere
 could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not beable
 to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced andmay
 continue  to  experience  in  the  future,  unexpected  increases  in  work  wages,  whether  government  mandated  or  otherwise  and  increases  in  compliance  costs  due  togovernmental
 regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be ableto
 fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer,there can
 be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptableto us,
 or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existingor
 find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturersin
 our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply ofmaterials
 or  manufacture  of  our  products  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  ability  to  meet  retail  customer  and  consumer  demand  for  our  products  and  result  in  lowerrevenues and net income both in the short- and long-term.
Because
 independent  manufacturers  make  a  majority  of  our  products  outside  of  our  principal  sales  markets,  our  products  must  be  transported  by  third  parties  over  largegeographic distances. Dela
ys in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or otherfactors,
 and  costs  and  delays  associated  with  consolidating  or  transitioning  between  manufacturers,  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  performance.  In  addition,manufacturing
 delays  or  unexpected  demand  for  our  products  may  require  us  to  use  faster,  but  more  expensive,  transportation  methods  such  as  air  freight,  which  couldadversely
 affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products canadversely affect our profit ma
rgins. Current U.S. trade policy proposals, including potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could also havea significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our results of operations.
In addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2017, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services
for
 NIKE  Brand  products  sold  in  certain  NIKE  markets  including  Argentina,  Uruguay,  Brazil,  Canada,  India,  South  Africa  and  Thailand  (collectively  the  “Sojitz  Markets”),excluding
 products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America’s banks could disrupt ourability
 to acquire  products  from our suppliers  and to deliver products  to our customers  in the  Sojitz  Markets.  Such a disruption  could result in canceled  orders that  wouldadversely affect sales and profitability.
Our success depends on our global distribution facilities.
We
 distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations,manage
 inventory,  complete  sales  and  achieve  objectives  for  operating  efficiencies  and  growth,  particularly  in  emerging  markets,  depends  on  the  proper  operation  of  ourdistribution
 facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved inshipping
 product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes orfires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilitie
s could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequatelyprotect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.
We rely significantly on
 information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure,inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to ef
fectively operate our business.We
 are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services (“Information Technology Systems”), across oursupply chain, includ
ing product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information forexternal and
 internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and ourbusiness
 processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and toship
 products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implementedInformation Techn
ology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in ourglobal
 operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches,viruses, hacker
s, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, or failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems withtransitioning
 to  upgraded  or  replacement  systems  could  cause  delays  in  product  fulfillment  and  reduced  efficiency  of  our  operations,  could  require  significant  capitalinvestments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of
 operations and financial condition.We
 also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financialreporting,
 legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of ourvendors,
 do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits,as
 well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing, digital commerce,consumer engageme
nt and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the worldbetween
 and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information TechnologySystems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss o
f users.13

Table of ContentsThe market for prime real estate is competitive.
Our
 ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability ofreal
 estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew ourexisting
 real  estate  leases.  In  addition,  from  time  to  time,  we  seek  to  downsize,  consolidate,  reposition  or  close  some  of  our  real  estate  locations,  which  may  requiremodification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of
our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and 
financial condition.Additionally,
 the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This couldimpact the quality of our decisio
ns to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality ofthese
 decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, whichcould have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
Extreme
 weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operatingresults
 and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their relatedconsequences
 and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result ineconomic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.
From time
 to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses,such
 as  our  digital  commerce  operations,  which  require  substantial  cash  investments  and  management  attention.  We  believe  cost-effective  investments  are  essential  tobusiness growth and profitability. Howeve
r, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existingbusiness.
 The  failure  of  any  significant  investment  to  provide  expected  returns  or  profitability  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  results  and  divertmanagement attention from more profitable business operations.
We
 are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.
As
 a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings andgovernment
 investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships,product
 liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings orinvestigations,
 and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness,
 financial  condition  and results  of operations  and negatively  impact  our reputation.  The global nature  of our business  means  that  legal and compliance  risks willcontinue to exist and
 additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition, any current or future legal orregulatory proceedings could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees.
We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business.
Our future
 success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business.Our
 future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategicinitiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.
The sale of a
 large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock.As
 of June 30, 2017, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned more than 78% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2017, all of these shares were converted into Class BCommon
 Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to therequirements
 of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantialnumber
 of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to holdthe
 majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. On June 30, 2016, Mr. Knight sold his voting interest in Swoosh, LLC to a trust controlled by his son and NIKE director,Travis Knight.
Changes
 in  our  credit  ratings  or  macroeconomic  conditions  may  affect  our  liquidity,  increasing  borrowing  costs  and  limiting  ourfinancing options.
Our
 long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term
 debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subjectto
 restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, makeinvestments,
 loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenantscould
 result  in  a  default,  and  as  a  result,  the  commitments  of  our  lenders  under  our  credit  agreements  may  be  terminated  and  the  maturity  of  amounts  owed  may  beaccelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.

Table of ContentsIf our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected.
Our
 internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements  because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  including  the  possibility  of  human  error,  thecircumvention
 or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation offinancial
 statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experiencedifficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
If
 our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adverselyaffected.
The
 preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make estimatesand
 assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and onvarious
 other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  as  provided  in  “Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  andResults
 of  Operations.”  The  results  of  these  estimates  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  the  carrying  values  of  assets,  liabilities  and  equity,  and  the  amount  ofrevenue and
 expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements includethose
 related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting forproperty,
 plant and equipment and definite-lived assets, hedge accounting for derivatives, stock-based compensation, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operatingresults
 may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fallbelow the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock.
Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock.
There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to
 protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt todeny
 coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, afreeze-out statute, two classes of stock that
 vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directorsrounded
 down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of ourcompany that some sharehol
ders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing marketprice. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company.
We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.
Our
 Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports includeinformation
 about our historical financial results as well as analysts’ estimates of our future performance. Analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are oftendifferent
 from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price coulddecline.
 In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stockprice
 is  volatile  for  any  reason,  we  may  become  involved  in  this  type  of  litigation  in  the  future.  Any  litigation  could  result  in  reputational  damage,  substantial  costs  and  adiversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.

NIKE
 designs,  develops,  markets  and  sells  athletic  footwear,  apparel,  equipment,  accessories  and  services  worldwide.  We  are  the  largest  seller  of  athletic  footwear  andapparel
 in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites and mobile applications(which
 we refer to collectively as our “Direct to Consumer” or “DTC” operations), and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtuallyall countries around
 the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessoriesbusinesses.
 Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brandsand delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail, online and through mobile applications.
In
 June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. Leveragingthe
 power of digital, NIKE will drive growth — by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-to-one connections.
In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas:
•
Expanding gross margin by: - 
Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value equation for consumers;- 
Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation;- 
Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential toincrease both customization of our products and speed to market; and
- 
Driving  growth  in  our  higher  gross  margin  DTC  business,  led  by  digital  commerce,  as  part  of  an  integrated  marketplace  growth  strategy  across  our  DTC  andwholesale operations.
•
Optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on: - 
Investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit; - 
Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and- 
Investments in key areas of future growth, including our DTC business.•
Managing working capital efficiency; and •
Deploying capital effectively. Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2020, on average per year, are as follows:
•
High single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth; •
Mid-teens earnings per share growth; •
High-twenties to low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital; •
Free cash flow growing faster than net income; and •
Sustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Over
 the past ten years, we have achieved many of our financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of bothcontinuing
 and  discontinued  operations,  have  grown  8%  and  13%,  respectively,  on  an  annual  compounded  basis.  We  expanded  gross  margin  by  approximately  70  basispoints, and our return on invested capital has increased from 21.9% to 34.7%.
On
 November 19, 2015, we announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividendpayable on December 23,
 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split.
Our
 fiscal 2017 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability. Despite foreign currency headwinds, weachieved
 record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2017. NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 6%  to $34.4 billion, Net income increased 13%  and diluted earnings per commonshare grew 16% to $2.51. We also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for long-term growth.
Earnings
 before interest and income taxes (“EBIT”) increased 7% for fiscal 2017, driven by revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage, partially offset bygross margin contract
ion. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across all NIKE Brand geographies and Converse, footwear and apparel, and several key categories.This broad-based growth was primarily fueled by:
•
Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri-Fit and Flyknit; •
Deep  brand  connections  with  consumers  through  our  category  offense,  reinforced  by  investments  in  endorsements  by  high-profile  athletes,  sports  teams  andleagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing; and
•
Strong category retail presentation through digital commerce and NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. NIKE,
 Inc. gross margin decreased 160 basis points primarily due to higher product costs and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds, which more than offset higher full-price
 average selling price (ASP). At current rates, we anticipate foreign currency exchange rate headwinds will continue to negatively impact gross margin and Net income in fiscal 2018.
21

Table of ContentsConverse
 revenues increased 4% and EBIT declined 2%, as growth in direct distribution markets and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by lowergross
 margin, primarily a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs, as well as the unfavorable impact of lowerlicensing revenues primarily due to market transitions.
For fiscal 2017, the growth in 
Net income was positively affected by a  year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 550 basis points primarily due to a one-time benefit inthe first quarter of
 the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed inthe
 United  States.  Diluted  earnings  per  common  share  grew  at  a  higher  rate  than Net  income due  to  a  3%  decrease  in  the  weighted  average  diluted  common  sharesoutstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.
While
 foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing ourbusiness to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Throughout
 this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  we  discuss  non-GAAP  financial  measures,  including  references  to  wholesale  equivalent  revenues  and  currency-neutralrevenues,
 which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generallyaccepted
 in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brandmarket
 footprint if we had no Direct to Consumer operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internalsales from our wholesa
le operations to our Direct to Consumer operations, which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers.Additionally,
 currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlyingbusiness trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Management
 uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company ’ s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally,management
 believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlyingbusiness
 performance  and  trends.  However,  references  to  wholesale  equivalent  revenues  and  currency-neutral  revenues  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  asubstitute
 for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used byother companies.

Compared to Fiscal 2016 On
 a  constant-currency  basis,  NIKE,  Inc. Revenues grew  8%  for  fiscal  2017,  primarily  driven  by  higher  revenues  for  the  NIKE  Brand  and  Converse.  All  NIKE  Brandgeographies
 delivered  higher  revenues  for  fiscal  2017  as  our  category  offense  continued  to  deliver  innovative  products,  deep  brand  connections  and  compelling  retailexperiences
 to consumers online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving demand for NIKE Brand products. Revenue growth was broad-based as Greater China,Western Europe, Emerging Markets and North America each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc
. Revenues . On a currency-neutral bas
is, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 8% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased3%.
 On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales forfiscal
 2017 increased 7%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 1 percentage point of footwear revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and off-priceASPs, partially offset by the impact of higher off-price sales.
The
 constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was fueled by growth in several key categories, most notably Sportswear, Men’s Training andRunning.
 Unit sales of apparel increased 6%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, growth in our higher-priced DTC business.
While
 wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. Our NIKEBrand
 DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as NIKE-owned digital commerce. For fiscal 2017, DTC revenues represented approximately28%
 of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 26% for fiscal 2016. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2017, driven by strong digitalcommerce
 sales growth of 30%, the addition of new stores and 7% comparable store sales growth. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line andfactory stores
 for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than15%
 within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales through NIKE-ownedwebsites
 and mobile applications, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2016 and representedapproximately 24% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2017 compared to 22% for fiscal 2016.
On
 a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 6%, driven by significant growth in Sportswear, Running and theJordan
 Brand,  while Women's  revenues  increased  8%,  led by  growth  in Sportswear  and Running.  Revenues  for our Young  Athletes'  business  increased  8%,  with growthacross multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand.
Fiscal 2016 
Compared to Fiscal 2015 On
 a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew  12% for fiscal 2016,  primarily driven  by higher revenues  for the  NIKE  Brand.  Every NIKE  Brand geography  grewrevenues for fiscal 2016. North America contrib
uted approximately 4 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues , while Greater China and Western Europe each contributed
 approximately 3 percentage points, Emerging Markets contributed approximately 2 percentage points and Central & Eastern Europe contributed approximately 1percentage point.
On
 a  constant-currency  basis,  NIKE  Brand  footwear  and  apparel  revenues  increased  15%  and  11%,  respectively,  for  fiscal  2016,  while  NIKE  Brand  equipment  revenuesdecreased
 2%. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, including strong growth in Sportswear, theJordan
 Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 9%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenuegrowth.
 Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business.
The constant-currency increase in NIKE
 Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men’s Training, Running,Women’s
 Training  and  Football  (Soccer).  Apparel  unit  sales  for  fiscal  2016  increased  7%.  Higher  ASP  per  unit  contributed  approximately  4  percentage  points  of  apparelrevenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in our higher-priced DTC business.

Table of ContentsFutures Orders
Futures orders for NIKE
 Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2017 totaled $ 14.7 billion , 2% lower than the orders reported for thecomparable
 prior year period. NIKE Brand futures orders include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digitalcommerce operations, which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated
based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. 
By geography, futures orders were as follows:

Futures  orders have been calculated using prior year exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding theimpact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Reported
 futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period and have become less correlated due to our evolving businessmodel.
 This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times, and because the fulfillmentof
 certain  orders  may  fall  outside  of  the  schedule  noted  above.  In  addition,  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations  as  well  as  differing  levels  of  order  cancellations,discounts
 and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. A portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders,including
 sales with short lead times, closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal ordersfrom our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley.

Compared to Fiscal 2016 For fiscal 2017, our consolidated gross margin was 160 basis points lower than fiscal 2016, primarily driven by the following factors:
•
Higher  NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, (increasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premiumproducts to the consumer;
•
Higher  NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 100 basis points) as an increase in the mix of higher cost products and labor input costinflation more than offset lower material input costs;
•
Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 90 basis points); and •
Lower NIKE Brand DTC margins (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points) reflecting the impact of higher off-price sales. Fiscal 2016 
Compared to Fiscal 2015 For fiscal 2016, our consolidated gross margin was 20 basis points higher than fiscal 2015, primarily attributable to the following factors:
•
Higher NIKE  Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, (increasing gross margin approximately 190 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premiumproducts with higher prices and, to a lesser extent, due to price increases reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories;
•
Growth in our higher-margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points); •
Higher  NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) as shifts in mix to higher-cost products and labor input cost inflation wereonly partially offset by lower material input costs;
•
Higher off-price mix (decreasing gross margin approximately 30 basis points), primarily reflecting the impacts from clearing excess inventory in North America; •
Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points); •
Higher other costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primarily due to higher product design and development costs; and •
Lower gross margin from Converse (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primari ly resulting from shifts in mix to lower-margin products.25

Operating Segments
Our
 operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operationsparticipating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each
 NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment.The
 Company’s  reportable  operating  segments  for  the  NIKE  Brand  are:  North  America,  Western  Europe,  Central  &  Eastern  Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  EmergingMarkets,
 and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company’s NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.Converse
 is  also  a  reportable  segment  for  the  Company  and  operates  in  one  industry:  the  design,  marketing,  licensing  and  selling  of  casual  sneakers,  apparel  andaccessories.
As
 part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in ourgeographic
 operating  segments  and  Converse.  These  rates  are  set  approximately  nine  and  twelve  months  in  advance  of  the  future  selling  seasons  to  which  they  relate(specifically,
 for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons)based
 on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for  geographic operating segments andConverse
 reflect  the  use  of  these  standard  rates  to  record  non-functional  currency  product  purchases  into  the  entity’s  functional  currency.  Differences  between  assignedstandard
 foreign  currency  rates  and  actual  market  rates  are  included  in  Corporate,  together  with  foreign  currency  hedge  gains  and  losses  generated  from  our  centrallymanaged foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

 increase in apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was due to growth concentrated in Sportswear, partially offset by declines in several other categories. Unit sales of apparelgrew 2% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP.
EBIT
 grew 3% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues.Gross
 margin increased 10 basis points as higher full-price ASP and favorable off-price margin more than offset higher product costs and increased off-price mix as a result ofclearing
 excess inventories through off-price channels, including through our DTC business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead ascontinued
 investments in our growing DTC business were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Demand creation was flat as higher sports marketing and retail brandpresentation costs offset lower marketing and advertising costs.
Fiscal 2016 
Compared to Fiscal 2015 On
 a constant-currency basis, North America revenues increased 8% primarily due to growth in our Sportswear, Jordan Brand and Running categories. DTC revenues grew17% for fiscal 2016, fueled by strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 6%.

 the UK & Ireland, which grew 11%. On a category basis, revenues increased for nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand.DTC revenues grew 28% for fiscal 2017 due to strong digital commerce sales growth, comparable store sales growth of 16% and the addition of new stores.
The
 constant-currency increase in footwear revenues was led by Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, partially offset by declines concentrated in Football (Soccer). Forfiscal
 2017, unit sales of footwear increased 5% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair wasprimarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business.

 apparel revenue growth was due to higher revenues for nearly every key category, most notably Sportswear and, to a lesser extent, Football (Soccer). Unitsales
 of apparel for fiscal 2017 increased 16%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP perunit was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business and higher full-price ASP.
Reported
 EBIT  decreased  16%  for  fiscal  2017,  in  part  reflecting  the  negative  impact  of  weakening  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  Higher  revenues  and  selling  andadministrative
 expense  leverage  were  more  than  offset  by  significant  gross  margin  contraction. Gross  margin  declined  550  basis  points  primarily  driven  by  the  effects  ofsignificant
 unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling  and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation expense, as increased sportsmarketing
 and advertising expenses more than offset lower marketing costs. Operating overhead also increased due to continued investments in our growing DTC business,partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation costs.

Compared to Fiscal 2016 On a constant-currenc
y basis, Central & Eastern Europe revenues increased 7%, with double-digit growth in nearly every territory. Revenue growth was led by two of Central &Eastern
 Europe's largest territories, Turkey and Russia, which each increased 14%, while revenues for our distributors business decreased 9%. On a category basis, revenuegrowth
 was  fueled  by  higher  revenues,  primarily  in  Sportswear,  which  more  than  offset  declines  in  several  other  categories.  DTC  revenues  increased  19%,  driven  bycomparable store sales growth of 9%, the addition of new stores and digital commerce sales growth.
The
 constant-currency footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to higher Sportswear revenues, partially offset by declines in most other categories.Unit sales of footwear increa

 apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to growth in Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributedapproximately
 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. ASP per unit increased as lower full-price ASP resulting from higher discounts was more than offset by thefavorable impact of growth in our DTC business.
Reported
 EBIT decreased 16% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margindeclined
 490 basis points primarily due to significant unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent ofrevenues
 despite higher demand creation expense driven by higher advertising and sports marketing costs, partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs. Operatingoverhead expense decreased primarily due to lower administrative and variable compensation costs, partially offset by continued investments in our DTC business.

Overview
As
 a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchangerates.
 Our  primary  foreign  currency  exposures  arise  from  the  recording  of  transactions  denominated  in  non-functional  currencies  and  the  translation  of  foreign  currencydenominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.
Our
 foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations,financial posit
ion and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage theseexposures
 by  taking  advantage  of  natural  offsets  and  currency  correlations  that  exist  within  the  portfolio  and,  where  practical  and  material,  by  hedging  a  portion  of  theremaining
 exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (“NTC”) andour foreign currency adjustment program enhanced
 our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that existwithin
 our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying netexposures
 being  hedged.  Where  exposures  are  hedged,  our  program  has  the  effect  of  delaying  the  impact  of  exchange  rate  movements  on  our  Consolidated  FinancialStatements; the length of the delay is dependent
 upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Transactional Exposures
We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:
•
Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctua tions in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.
Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: a.
Certain  NIKE  entities  purchase  product  from  the  NTC,  a  wholly-owned  sourcing  hub  that  buys  NIKE  branded  products  from  third-party  factories,predominantly
 in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functionalcurrencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the
 result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.
Other  NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for thoseNIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.

Factory  input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreigncurrency
 risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures.Under this program, our pay
ments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which thelabor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.
For
 the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting theproduct
 cost is recorded within Inventories and  is recognized in Cost  of sales when  the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices,excluding
 the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair valuethrough 
Other  (income)  expense,  net .  Refer  to Note  16  —  Risk  Management  and  Derivatives in  the  accompanying  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements for additional detail.
As
 an offset  to the impacts  of the fluctuating  U.S. Dollar on our non-functional  currency denominated  product  purchases described above, a strengthe ning U.S.
 Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakeningU.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.
•
Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our
 Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses theEuro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.
•
Other  Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certaincases, the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to
 foreign currencies and create embedded derivativecontracts that are recorded at fair value through 
  Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.
•
Non-Functional  Currency  Denominated  Monetary  Assets  and  Liabilities  —  Our  global  subsidiaries  have  various  assets  and  liabilities,  primarily  receivables  andpayables,
 including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subjectto re-measurement which may create fluctuations in 
Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. Managing Transactional Exposures
Transactional
 exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of naturaloffsets
 and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange ratefluctuations
 on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs describedabove. Generally, these are accounted for as cash
 flow hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product costexposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above.
Certain
 currency  forward  contracts  used  to  manage  the  foreign  exchange  exposure  of  non-functional  currency  denominated  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  subject  to  re-measurement
 and  embedded  derivative  contracts  are  not  formally  designated  as  hedging  instruments  under  U.S.  GAAP.  Accordingly,  changes  in  fair  value  of  theseinstruments
 are immediately recognized in Other  (income) expense, net and  are intended to offset  the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement  of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged.
Refer
 to Note  6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements foradditional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.
Translational Exposures
Many
 of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results aswe
 are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreignsubsidiaries’
 non-U.S.  Dollar  denominated  balance  sheets  into  U.S.  Dollars  for  consolidated  reporting  results  in  a  cumulative  translation  adjustment  to Accumulated  othercomprehensive
 income within  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Shareholders’  Equity.  In  the  translation  of  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income,  a  weaker  U.S.  Dollar  inrelation
 to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchangerate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated 
Revenues was a detriment of approximately $542 milli on and $1,985 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016,respectively.
 The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income  before income taxes was  a detriment of approximately $115 million and $449million for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Managing Translational Exposures
To minimize the impact of translat
ing foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excesscash
 to  purchase  U.S.  Dollar  denominated  available-for-sale  investments.  The  variable  future  cash  flows  associated  with  the  purchase  and  subsequent  sale  of  theseU.S.
 Dollar  denominated  securities  at  non-U.S.  Dollar  functional  currency  subsidiaries  creates  a  foreign  currency  exposure  that  qualifies  for  hedge  accounting  under  theaccounting
 standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of theseU.S.
 Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year
 foreign  currency  translation  impact  on  net  earnings  in  the  period  the  investments  are  sold.  Hedges  of  available-for-sale  investments  are  accounted  for  as  cash  flowhedges.

 to Note  6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements foradditional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.
We estimate the combination of
 translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency relatedgains
 and losses included in Other  (income) expense, net had  an unfavorable impact of approximately $59 million and $423 million on our Income  before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Net Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries
We
 are  also  exposed  to  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  on  our  investments  in  wholly-owned  foreign  subsidiaries  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  theU.S.
 Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged andmay,
 in  the  future,  hedge  net  investment  positions  in  certain  foreign  subsidiaries  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  on  these  net  investments.  Thesehedges are
 accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2017 and 2016. There were no cash flows from netinvestment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Activity
Cash
 provided by operations was $3,640 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $3,096 million for fiscal 2016 .  Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $4,781 million of operating cash flow in 
fiscal 2017 compared to $4,676 million for fiscal 2016 . Our fiscal 2017 change in working capital was a cash outflow of $1,141 million compared to an outflow 
of $1,580 million for fiscal 2016 .  The change in working capital was primarily due to the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result ofhedging
 activities. For fiscal 2017, cash collateral received from counterparties, which is recorded in Accrued  liabilities on  the Consolidated Balance Sheets, decreased $105million compared to
 a decrease of $863 million during fiscal 2016. Refer to the Credit Risk section of Note 16  — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. 
This decrease in cash collateral was partially offset by a $486 million increase in Accounts Receivable, net driven by higher revenues.
Cash used by investing activities 
was $1,008 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $1,034 million for fiscal 2016 , driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments and reverse
 repurchase agreements, as well as additions of property, plant and equipment. During fiscal  2017 ,  the net change in investments (including sales, maturities andpurchases) resulted in a cash inflow of 
$118 million compared to an outflow of $57 million in fiscal 2016 . This change was  partially offset by the maturity of reverse repurchaseagreements of 
$150 million in fiscal 2016 which did  not recur in fiscal 2017 .  Additions of property, plant and equipment were $1,105 million in  fiscal 2017 compared to $1,143 million 
in fiscal 2016 . In
 fiscal 2018, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, new DTC stores, and expanding our digital capabilities.We continue to expect such investments will be approximately 4% of revenues, on average.
Cash used by financing activities 
was $1,942 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $2,671 million for fiscal 2016 . The decrease in Cash used by financing activities was primarily driven
 by increased proceeds from the issuance of debt and commercial paper in fiscal 2017, partially offset by higher dividends and lower excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements.
In 
fiscal 2017 ,  we purchased 59.7  million shares  of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $3,249  million (an  average price of $ 54.43 per  share) under the four-year, $12 billionprogram
 approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2017, we had repurchased 79.8  million shares  at a cost of approximately $4,437  million (an average price of 
$55.63 per share) under this program. We continue to  expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceedsfrom debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock
 market conditions.Capital Resources
On
 October 21, 2016, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2026 and 2046. The 2026 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principalamount of
 $1.0 billion at a 2.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2026. The 2046 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amountof $500 million at a 3.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2046. Interest on 
the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 ofeach year.
 The issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $1,493 million. Refer to Note 8  — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for additional detail on Long-term debt . On
 August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility maturesAugust
 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and forthe periods ended 
May 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility. We
 currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings wereto
 decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee andinterest
 rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowingsunder
 the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixedassets
 and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have anyborrowings
 outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowingswould
 become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2017 ,  we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any ofthese covenants in the foreseeable future.

 is  also  provided  by  our  $2  billion  commercial  paper  program.  During  the  year  ended May  31,  2017 ,  the  maximum  amount  of  commercial  paper  borrowingsoutstanding
 at any point was $919 million. As of May  31, 2017 ,  there were $325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercialpaper
 or other debt securities during fiscal 2018 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor'sCorporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.
As
 of May  31,  2017 ,  we  had  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  totaling $6.2  billion ,  of  which $5.8  billion was  held  by  our  foreign  subsidiaries. Cash equivalents 
and Short-term investments consist  primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations,U.S.
 government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interestrate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of 
May 31, 2017 , the average duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 
65  days.To
 date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costsassociated
 with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-terminvestments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of 
funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capitalneeds in the foreseeable future.
We
 utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate aportion
 of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our currentplans
 do not demonstrate  a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States,  we may elect to repatriate  indefinitely  reinvestedforeign funds
 or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additionalU.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United 
States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In
 connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issuesthat
 arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and theestimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.
Contractual Obligations
Our
 significant long-term contractual obligations as of May  31, 2017 and  significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through thedate of this report are as follows:

Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements. (2)
The  cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicablefixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of 
May 31, 2017 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. (3)
The  amounts  listed  for  endorsement  contracts  represent  approximate  amounts  of  base  compensation  and  minimum  guaranteed  royalty  fees  we  are  obligated  to  payathlete,
 public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contractsprovide
 for  bonuses  to  be  paid  to  the  endorsers  based  upon  athletic  achievements  and/or  royalties  on  product  sales  in  future  periods.  Actual  payments  under  somecontracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.
In
 addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on thisproduct
 on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to theendorsers
 will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regardingproduct and marketing initiatives. In
 addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of timeand are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.
(4)
We  generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from external wholesale customers and internalorders
 from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchaseorders)
 to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices aresubject to change throughout the production process.
(5)
Other  purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts,made
 in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significantterms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.

 addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate whencash
 payments will occur. Refer to Note  9 — Income Taxes and Note 13 — Benefit Plans in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for furtherinformation related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively.
We
 also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May  31, 2017 .  Refer to Note  7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in  the accompanyingNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the

New Accounting Pronouncements
Refer
 to Note  1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issuedaccounting standards.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our
 previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared inaccordance
 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates andjudgments
 that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note  1 — Summary ofSignificant
 Accounting Policies in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in thepreparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We
 believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements,so we
 consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committeeof
 the Board of Directors. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle isrelatively
 short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generallyaffect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters.
Because
 of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context ofthese critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
Revenue Recognition
We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of
 sale. Title passes generally uponshipment
 or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of saleand digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.
In
 some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Ourrevenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.
In
 certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the dateof
 receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests  of actual transactions, we have no indication that theseestimates have been materially inaccurate historically.
As
 part  of  our  revenue  recognition  policy,  we  record  estimated  sales  returns,  discounts  and  miscellaneous  claims  from  customers  as  reductions  to  revenues  at  the  timerevenues
 are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted tocertain
 customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims andoutstanding
 returns  not  yet  received  from  customers  and  (3)  estimated  returns,  discounts  and  claims  expected  but  not  yet  finalized  with  our  customers.  Actual  returns,discounts
 and  claims  in  any  future  period  are  inherently  uncertain  and  thus  may  differ  from  our  estimates.  If  actual  or  expected  future  returns,  discounts  and  claims  aresignificantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination.
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable
We make ongoing estimates re
lating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customersto
 make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness ofsignificant
 customers  based  on  ongoing  credit  evaluations.  Since  we  cannot  predict  future  changes  in  the  financial  stability  of  our  customers,  actual  future  losses  fromuncollectible
 accounts  may  differ  from  our  estimates.  If  the  financial  condition  of  our  customers  were  to  deteriorate,  resulting  in  their  inability  to  make  payments,  a  largerallowance might
 be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.
39

Table of ContentsInventory Reserves
We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
If we estimate thatthe
 net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of theinventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to 
Cost of sales . If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizabl
e value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales 
. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts
A
 significant portion of our Demand  creation expense relates  to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over theterm of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently,
 based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain
 contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creationexpense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.
Certain
 contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining aspecified
 ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in Demand  creation expense ratably  over the contract periodbased on our
 best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in theendorser’s performance, increased or decreased 
Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain
 contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as
 the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteedamount
 of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed  payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand  creationexpense 
uniformly over the contract term. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Live
d AssetsWe
 review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount ofthe
 assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an assetis used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect
 the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of anasset,
 among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset groupexceeds
 the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of theprimary
 asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the assetgroup
 using  appropriate  valuation  methodologies  that  would  typically  include  an  estimate  of  discounted  cash  flows.  Any  impairment  would  be  measured  as  the  differencebetween the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
Hedge Accounting for Derivatives
We
 use  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  certain  anticipated  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  transactions  as  well  as  certain  non-functional  currency  monetary  assets  andliabilities.
 When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows arerecorded in 
Other comprehensive income , rather than Net income ,  until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income . In  most cases, this results in gains and losseson
 hedge derivatives being released from Other  comprehensive income into Net income sometime  after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accountingtreatment
 is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates ofanticipated
 transactions  may  fluctuate  over  time  and  may  ultimately  vary  from  actual  transactions.  When  anticipated  transaction  estimates  or  actual  transaction  amountsdecline
 below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month
 period  of  time  thereafter,  we  are  required  to  reclassify  the  cumulative  change  in  fair  value  of  the  over-hedged  portion  of  the  related  hedge  contract  from Other comprehensive income 
to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. Stock-based Compensation
We
 account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. TheBlack-Scholes
 option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in markettraded
 options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of activelytraded options
 on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change andwe
 use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future fromthat recorded in the current period.
Income Taxes
We
 record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependenton
 future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxableincome.
 To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income  tax expense in the period when such determination is made.
In
 addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducingour overall 
Income  tax expense .  The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshoreassets and our
 expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earningsto be indefinitely reinvested offshore.
40

Table of ContentsWe
 carefully  review  all  factors  that  drive  the  ultimate  disposition  of  foreign  earnings  determined  to  be  reinvested  offshore  and  apply  stringent  standards  to  overcome  thepresumption
 of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amountsdeclared
 as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or theactual cash needs of
 our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were
 no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxeshave been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our 
Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On
 an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before
 income taxes excluding  infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income  tax expense .  The income tax effects of infrequent or unusualitems
 are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings byjurisdiction
 during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjustthe income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.
On
 a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positionsbased
 on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in therecognition
 of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment  changes.  We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxmatters in 
Income tax expense . Other Contingencies
In
 the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and avariety
 of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonablyestimable.
 Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions ofthird-party
 claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. Iffuture
 adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period inwhich
 the  actual  loss  or  change  in  estimate  occurred.  In  addition  to  contingent  liabilities  recorded  for  probable  losses,  we  disclose  contingent  liabilities  when  there  is  areasonable
 possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do notbelieve
 any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position orcash flows.

Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosur
es about Market RiskIn
 the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations inthe
 value  of  foreign  currencies  and  interest  rates.  It  is  our  policy  to  utilize  these  financial  instruments  only  where  necessary  to  finance  our  business  and  manage  suchexposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.
We are
 exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk managementprogram is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctua
tions on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We useforward
 and  option  contracts  to  hedge  certain  anticipated,  but  not  yet  firmly  committed,  transactions  as  well  as  certain  firm  commitments  and  the  related  receivables  andpayables, inclu
ding third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in thenet
 assets  of  certain  international  subsidiaries  to  offset  foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  related  to  our  net  investment  in  those  subsidiaries.  Where  exposures  arehedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate
 movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The
 timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon thenature
 of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecastedtransaction and may place incremental hedges up to 
100% of the exposure by the time the  forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2017 
are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives 
in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. Our
 earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates.  Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact ofinterest rate
 changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, andfixed-rate debt of varying maturities.
Market Risk Measurement
We
 monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk
 (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts,  interest rate swaps,intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.
We
 use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximumpotential
 one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95%confidence
 level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies andinterest
 rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over thepreceding
 one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potentialloss
 in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currencyrate
 fluctuations  on  the  derivative  instruments  only  and  does  not  include  the  impact  of  such  rate  fluctuations  on  non-functional  currency  transactions  (such  as  anticipatedtransactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.
The
 VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent  actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential  effect  of favorablechanges in
 market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because ofchanges or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
The
 estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $97 million and $109million
 at  May  31,  2017  and  2016,  respectively.  The  VAR  decreased  year-over-year  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  foreign  currency  volatilities  at  May  31,  2017.  Such  ahypothetical
 loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in thefair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $161 million and $209 million during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
The
 instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interestrate
 U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functionalcurrency
 intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above.Therefore, we
 consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidatedfinancial position, results from operations and cash flows.
Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

portingManagement
 is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) -15(f)
 of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  Internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  thereliability
 of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the UnitedStates
 of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only inaccordance
 with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect
 on the financial statements.While
 “reasonable assurance” is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reportingmay not
 prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two ormore
 people,  including  our  senior  management.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  becomeinadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
 Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of ourinternal control
 over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  — Integrated Framework (2013) issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ofthe
 Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as ofMay 31, 2017

 Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May  31, 2017 ,  based on criteriaestablished
 in Internal  Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’smanagement
 is  responsible  for  these  financial  statements  and  financial  statement  schedule,  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  itsassessment
 of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearingunder
 Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Company’s internal control over financialreporting
 based on our integrated  audits. We conducted  our audits  in accordance  with the standards  of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight  Board (United States).Those
 standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement andwhether
 effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,evidence
 supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management andevaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting,
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our
 audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for ouropinions.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliabil
ity of financial reporting and the preparation offinancial
 statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes thosepolicies
 and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets ofthe
 company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generallyaccepted accounting
 principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of thecompany;
 and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that couldhave a material effect on the financial statements.
Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness tofuture
 periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or proceduresmay deteriorate.

Basis of Consolidation
The
 Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All significant intercompany transactions and balances havebeen eliminated.
On November 19,
 2015, the Company announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stockdividend
 payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price onDecember 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to 
fiscal 2017 presentation. Revenue Recognition
Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and
 the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment orupon
 receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and onlinestore
 revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated andrecorded
 as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that areexpected
 to be granted to certain customers at a later date. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identificationof
 outstanding  claims  and  outstanding  returns  not  yet  received  from  customers  and  (3)  estimated  discounts,  returns  and  claims  expected,  but  not  yet  finalized  withcustomers.
 As of May  31, 2017 and 2016 ,  the Company’s reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $643  million and $789million 
, respectively. Cost of Sales
Cost
 of sales consists  primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedgegains and losses and research, design and development costs. Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in 
Cost of sales . Demand Creation Expense
Demand
 creation expense consists  of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events andretail
 brand  presentation.  Advertising  production  costs  are  expensed  the  first  time  an  advertisement  is  run.  Advertising  communication  costs  are  expensed  when  theadvertisement
 appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation iscompleted and delivered.
A
 significant  amount  of  the  Company’s  promotional  expenses  result  from  payments  under  endorsement  contracts.  Accounting  for  endorsement  payments  is  based  uponspecific
 contract  provisions.  Generally,  endorsement  payments  are  expensed  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  contract  after  giving  recognition  to  periodicperformance
 compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid  expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxesand other assets 
depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Certain
 contracts  provide  for  contingent  payments  to  endorsers  based  upon  specific  achievements  in  their  sports  (e.g.,  winning  a  championship).  The  Company  recordsdemand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.
Certain
 contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining aspecified
 ranking  in  a  sport  for  a  year).  When  the  Company  determines  payments  are  probable,  the  amounts  are  reported  in Demand  creation expense ratably  over  thecontract
 period based on the Company’s best estimate of the endorser’s performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from theCompany’s estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance, increased or decreased demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.
Certain
 contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments inCost of sales 
as  the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which the Company estimates it willnot
 meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earnedthrough sales of product in 
Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract period. 52

Table of ContentsThrough
 cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses customers for certain costs of advertising the Company’s products. The Company records these costs inDemand creation expense 
at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs . This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run.Total
 advertising and promotion expenses were $3,341  million , $3,278 million and $3,213 million for  the years ended May  31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively. Prepaidadvertising
 and promotion expenses totaled $558 million and $540 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively, of which $311 million and $272 million , respectively, was recorded in 
Prepaid expenses  and other current assets , and $247 million and $268 million ,  respectively, was recorded in Deferred income taxes  and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepayment applies.
Operating Overhead Expense
Operating
 overhead  expense consists  primarily  of  wage  and  benefit-related  expenses  as  well  as  other  administrative  costs,  such  as  rent,  depreciation  and  amortization,professional services and meetings and travel.
Cash and Equivalents
Cash and equivalents 
represent cash  and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that theypresent insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market 
funds, time depositsand corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term
 investments consist  of  highly  liquid  investments,  including  commercial  paper,  U.S.  Treasury,  U.S.  Agency,  time  deposits  and  corporate  debt  securities,  withmaturities ove
r 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2017 
and 2016 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At 
May 31, 2017 and 2016 , Short-term investments consisted  of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains andlosses
 reported, net of tax, in Accumulated  other comprehensive income ,  unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses onthe
 sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months,as
 available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assetswithin 
Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to 
Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company’s short-term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable, net 
consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and
 maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, theCompany
 considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accountsreceivable
 with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets 
. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $19 million and $43 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Inventory Valuation
Inventories 
are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on either an avera ge or specific identification cost basis. For inventories in transit that represent direct shipments tocustomers,
 the  related  inventory  and  cost  of  sales  are  recognized  on  a  specific  identification  basis.  Inventory  costs  primarily  consist  of  product  cost  from  the  Company'ssuppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and
 equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to40 
years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.Depreciation
 and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost  of sales .  Depreciation and amortization of all otherassets are recorded in 
Operating overhead expense . Software Development Costs
Internal
 Use Software :  Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12 year period on astraight-line
 basis. The Company’s policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal usecomputer
 software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computersoftware
 projects.  The  amount  of  capitalizable  payroll  costs  with  respect  to  these  employees  is  limited  to  the  time  directly  spent  on  such  projects.  Costs  associated  withpreliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.
Computer
 Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed :  Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of aproduct
 are subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release tocustomers.
 In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurredsubsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

Table of ContentsImpairment of Long-Lived Assets
The
 Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carryingamount
 of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner inwhich
 an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observablemarket
 value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if thecarrying
 value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over theremaining
 economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Companywill
 estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairmentwould be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangi
ble AssetsThe
 Company  performs  annual  impairment  tests  on  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  lives  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year  or  when  events  occur  orcircumstances
 change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events orchanges
 in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reportingunit,
 planned  divestitures  or  an  expectation  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable,  among  other  factors.  The  Company  may  first  assess  qualitative  factors  todetermine whether it is
 more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, theCompany
 determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. Thetwo-step impairment
 test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill ofthat reporting unit is potentia
lly impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records animpairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.
Indefinite-l
ived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it ismore
 likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the C ompany determines that it is morelikely than
 not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculationis
 required for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extentthat
 their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for therelated brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.
Operating Leases
The
 Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating leaseagreements may contain rent esca
lation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating
 leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective leasecommencement
 date,  which  is  generally  the  date  in  which  the  Company  takes  possession  of  or  controls  the  physical  use  of  the  property.  Certain  leases  also  provide  forcontingent
 rent, which is generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rentexpense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures certain
 financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price theCompany
 would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level
 hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the variousvaluation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach).
The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
•
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. •
Level  2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets orliabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the
 fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset orliability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Pricing vendors
 are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputswithout
 applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals,volatilities
 and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricingcurves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties.
54

Table of ContentsLevel 1 investments inclu
de U.S. Treasury securities. Assets and liabilities included within Level 2 include commercial paper, U.S. Agency securities, money market funds, timedeposits,
 corporate debt securities and derivative contracts. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs and are an immaterialportion of our portfolio.
The Company’s fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.
Refer to 
Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactio
nsAdjustments
 resulting  from  translating  foreign  functional  currency  financial  statements  into  U.S.  Dollars  are  included  in  the  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment,  acomponent of 
Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders’ equity . The
 Company’s global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functionalcurrency.
 These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other  (income) expense, net ,  within the Consolidated Statements ofIncome.
Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities
The
 Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fairvalue
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated  other comprehensive income(a component of 
Total shareholders’ equity ), Long-term debt or Net income depending on  the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designatedas
 a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as thecash
 flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash  provided by operations component of the
 Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows.  For  designated  net  investment  hedges,  this  is  within  the Cash  used  by  investing  activities component  of  the  ConsolidatedStatements
 of Cash Flows. For the Company’s fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable tochanges
 in  interest  rates,  the  related  cash  flows  from  periodic  interest  payments  are  reflected  within  the Cash  provided  by  operations component  of  the  ConsolidatedStatements of Cash Flows. Refer to 
Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Company’s risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation
The
 Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and employees’ purchase rights under theEmployee
 Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as Operating overhead expense 
in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Refer to 
Note 11 — Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for more information on the Company’s stock-based compensation programs. Income Taxes
The
 Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expectedfuture
 tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance toreduce deferred tax
 assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statementearnings of
 non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely inits non-U.S. operations.
The
 Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained uponexamination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in 
Income tax expense . Refer to 
Note 9 — Income Taxes for further discussion. Earnings Per Share
Basic
 earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by  the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings percommon share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.
Refer to 
Note 12 — Earnings Per Share for further discussion. Management Estimates
The
 preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating toassumptions
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reportedamounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Table of ContentsRecently Adopted Accounting Standards
In
 April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest  — Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of DebtIssuance
 Costs. The  updated guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability on thebalance
 sheet. The Company adopted the standard on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this standard reduced both Deferred  incometaxes and other assets 
and Long-term debt by $17 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2016 . Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In
 October  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2016-16, Income  Taxes  (Topic 740):  Intra-Entity  Transfers  of  Assets  Other  Than  Inventory .  The  updated  guidance  requirescompanies
 to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Income tax effects of intra-entitytransfers
 of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018, using amodified
 retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect recognized through retained earnings at the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of anannual
 reporting period for which interim or annual financial statements have not been issued. The Company is evaluating the impact this update will have on its existingaccounting
 policies and the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates the updated guidance could have a material impact on the Consolidated FinancialStatements at adoption through the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment
 to retained earnings of previously deferred charges.In March 2016,
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensatio n — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which changes
 how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees. The updated guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies fromshare-based
 payment awards to be recorded in income tax expense in the income statement. Currently, excess tax benefits and deficiencies are recognized in shareholders’equity
 on the balance sheet. This change is required to be applied prospectively. In addition, the updated guidance also changes the accounting for statutory tax withholdingrequirements,
 classification in the statement of cash flows and provides an option to continue to estimate forfeitures or account for forfeitures as they occur. The Company willadopt the standard on June 1,
 2017 and will elect to continue to estimate forfeitures. The ASU is expected to result in increased volatility to the Company’s income tax expensein
 future periods dependent upon, among other variables, the price of its common stock and the timing and volume of share-based payment award activity, such as employeeexercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards.
In
 February  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2016-02, Leases  (Topic  842) ,  that  replaces  existing  lease  accounting  guidance.  The  new  standard  is  intended  to  provideenhanced
 transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance willrequire the Company to
 continue to classify leases as either operating or financing, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. TheCompany will adopt the standard on June 1,
 2019. The ASU is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest period presented,with
 optional  practical  expedients.  The Company is in the process  of evaluating  the effect  the guidance  will have on its existing  accounting  policies and the ConsolidatedFinancial
 Statements, but expects there will be an increase in assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at adoption due to the recording of right-of-use assetsand corresponding lease liabilities, which may be material. Refer to 
Note 15 — Commitments and Contingencies for information about the Company’s lease obligations. In
 January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial  Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and FinancialLiabilities 
.  The  updated  guidance  enhances  the  reporting  model  for  financial  instruments,  which  includes  amendments  to  address  aspects  of  recognition,  measurement,presentation
 and disclosure. The update to the standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a materialimpact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In
 May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue  from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updatedguidance requi
res companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration towhich
 the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount,timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2018 using a modified retrospectiveapproach
 with the cumulative effective of initially applying the new standard recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application. The Company is in the process ofevaluating
 the new standard against its existing accounting policies, including the timing of revenue recognition, and its contracts with customers, to determine the effect theguidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 effective tax rate for the year ended May  31, 2017 was 550 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May  31, 2016 primarily  due to a one-timebenefit
 in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreignearnings taxed in the United States.
The
 effective tax rate for the year ended May  31, 2016 was 350 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May  31, 2015 primarily  due to an increase inthe proportion of earnings from operations outside of the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate.

 of May  31, 2017 ,  total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $461  million , $230 million of  which would affect the Company'seffective tax rate if recognized in future periods.
The
 Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income  tax expense .  The liability for payment of interest and penalties decreased by $38 million 
during  the year ended May 31, 2017 , increased by $45 million during  the year ended May 31, 2016 and decreased by $3 million during  the year ended May 31, 2015 . As of 
May 31, 2017 and 2016 , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $171 million and $209 million , respectively (excluding federal benefit). The
 Company is subject to taxation in the United States as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, the Company received statutory notices ofdeficiency from
 the IRS for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 proposing a total increase in tax of $254 million ,  subject to interest, related to a foreign tax credit matter. The Companycontested these deficiencies by filing petitions with
 the U.S Tax Court. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company reached a resolution with the IRS on thismatter.
 Decisions were subsequently filed in U.S. District Tax Court stating there is no deficiency in income tax due from the Company. In the current period, the Companyclosed
 all U.S. federal income tax matters for fiscal years 2013 and 2014, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. The Company is currently under audit bythe IRS for fiscal years 
2015 and 2016 . The
 Company’s  major  foreign  jurisdictions,  China  and  the  Netherlands,  have  concluded  substantially  all  income  tax  matters  through  calendar  2006  and  fiscal  2010,respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in 
the aggregate, along with the expiration ofapplicable
 statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $69  million within  the next 12months.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.At 
May 31, 2017 ,  the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided were approximately $12.2 billion . If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States or
 if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, they would generateforeign
 tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. Assuming a full utilization of the foreigntax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings would be approximately 
$4.1 billion at May 31, 2017 . A
 portion of the Company's foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021 .  This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions aremet
 or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday was $187  million , $173 million and $174 million for  the fiscalyears ended 
May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.11 , $0.10 and $0.10 for the fiscal years ended 
May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Deferred
 tax assets at May  31, 2017 and 2016 were  reduced by a valuation allowance primarily relating to tax benefits of certain entities with operating losses. There was a$30
 million net  increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended May  31, 2017 ,  compared to a net increase of $43  million for  the year ended May  31, 2016 and no netchange for the year ended 
May 31, 2015 . The Company has recorded deferred tax assets of 
$208 million at May 31, 2017 for foreign tax credit carry-forwards which expire in 2027. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of 
$266 million at May 31, 2017 . Such losses will expire as follows:

 weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May  31, 2017 was 5.7 years and 4.5 years, respectively. The aggregateintrinsic
 value for options outstanding and exercisable at May  31, 2017 was $2,027 million and $1,846 million ,  respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount bywhich
 the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2017 
, 2016 and 2015 was $594 million , $946 million and $795 million , respectively. In
 addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans(ESPPs).
 Subject to the annual statutory limit, employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to 10% of  their compensation. At the end of each six -month
 offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of  the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employeespurchased 
3.1 million , 2.5 million and 2.7 million shares during each of the three years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. From
 time to time, the Company grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to key employees under the Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares underlying suchawards
 granted to employees during the years ended May  31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were 0.4 million , 1.0 million and 0.5 million ,  respectively, with weighted average valuesper share of 
$57.59 , $54.87 and $39.69 ,  respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period ofrestriction.
 Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stockunits
 was established  by the market price on the date of grant.  During the years ended May  31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  the aggregate fair value of restricted stock andrestricted
 stock units vested was $60  million , $49 million and $20 million ,  respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. As of May  31, 2017 ,  the Company had $43 million 
of unrecognized compensation costs  from restricted stock and restricted stock units to be recognized in Operating overhead expense over a weighted average period of 2.4 
years.64

Table of ContentsIn
 connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage forlegal
 issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on theCompany’s
 historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to theCompany’s financial position or results of operations.
In
 the  ordinary  course  of  its  business,  the  Company  is  involved  in  various  legal  proceedings  involving  contractual  and  employment  relationships,  product  liability  claims,trademark
 rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe anycurrently
 identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position orcash flows.
NOTE 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives
The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect
 of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financialexposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
The
 Company  may  elect  to  designate  certain  derivatives  as  hedging  instruments  under  the  accounting  standards  for  derivatives  and  hedging.  The  Company  formallydocuments
 all  relationships  between  designated  hedging  instruments  and  hedged  items  as  well  as  its  risk  management  objectives  and  strategies  for  undertaking  hedgetransactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions.
The
 majority  of  derivatives  outstanding  as  of May  31,  2017 are  designated as  foreign  currency  cash  flow  hedges,  primarily  for  Euro/U.S.  Dollar,  British  Pound/Euro  andJapanese
 Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs . All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instrument’s maturitydate.

Accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 
2016 and 2015 . Cash Flow Hedges
The
 purpose  of the Company's  foreign exchange risk management  program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects  of currency fluctuations  on the Company'sconsolidated
 results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures that the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costexposures, non-functional
 currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.
Product
 cost  exposures  are  primarily  generated  through  non-functional  currency  denominated  product  purchases  and  the  foreign  currency  adjustment  program  describedbelow.
 NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase  product from the NIKE Trading Company (“NTC”), a wholly owned sourcinghub
 that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product toNIKE
 entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for theNTC. (2)
 Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entitieswith a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
The
 Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assumingcertain
 of  the  factories’  foreign  currency  exposures,  some  of  which  are  natural  offsets  to  the  Company's  existing  foreign  currency  exposures.  Under  this  program,  theCompany’s
 payments  to these factories  are adjusted for rate fluctuations  in the basket of currencies (“factory currency  exposure index”) in which the labor, materials andoverhead
 costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in thelocal or functiona
l currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollarand
 the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory’s acceptance of NIKE’s purchase order. Embedded derivativecontracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.
The
 Company’s policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed.Typically, the
 Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of
 the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The  total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $11.1 billion 
 as of May 31, 2017 . During
 the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company terminated all forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $1.5  billion in connection with
 the October 21, 2016 debt issuance (refer to Note 8 - Long-Term Debt). Upon termination of these forward-starting swaps, the Company made cash payments to therelated counterparties of 
$92 million , which was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive 68

Table of Contentsincome 
and  will be released through Interest  expense (income), net as  interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016,the
 Company terminated certain forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1  billion in  connection with the October 29, 2015 debt issuance (refer toNote
 8 — Long-Term Debt ).  Upon termination of these forward-starting swaps, the Company received cash payments from the related counterparties of $34  million , which was
 recorded in Accumulated  other comprehensive income and  will be released through Interest  expense (income), net as  interest expense is incurred over the term of theissued debt.
All changes in fair
 value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive income  until  Net income 
 is  affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in  Accumulated  other comprehensive income  will  be releasedto
  Net income  in  periods following the maturity of the related derivative, rather than at maturity. Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements ofIncome
 in  the  same  manner  as  the  underlying  exposure.  The  results  of  hedges  of  non-functional  currency  denominated  revenues  and  product  cost  exposures,  excludingembedded
 derivatives, are recorded in Revenues or Cost of sales when  the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated Net income .  Results of hedges of selling andadministrat
ive expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Amounts recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive income  related to
 forward-starting interest rate swaps will be released through  Interest  expense (income), net  as  interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt. Results ofhedges
 of anticipated purchases and sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in Other  (income) expense, net when  the securities are sold.Results
 of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in  Other  (income) expense, net when  the transaction occurs. The Company classifies thecash
 flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the Cash provided by operations 
component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Premiums paid or rece
ived on options are initially recorded as deferred charges or deferred credits, respectively. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based onthe total cash flows method and records total changes in the options’ fair value to 
Accumulated other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective. The
 Company formally assesses, both at a hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highlyeffective
 in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness forcash flow hedges is assessed based on changes in forward rates 
. Ineffectiveness was immaterial for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . The
 Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of ahedged
 item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; (3) it is no longerprobable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.
When the
 Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expectedto
 occur within an additional two -month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in Accumulated  other comprehensive income and is reclassified to Net income 
when  the forecasted transaction affects consolidated Net income .  However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originallyspecified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately
 in Other  (income) expense, net .  In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry thederivative at its
 fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recognizing future changes in the fair value in Other (income) expense, net . For the years ended May 31, 2017 , 
2016 and 2015 ,  the amounts recorded in Other  (income) expense, net as  a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was nolonger probable of occurring were 
immaterial . As of 
May  31, 2017 , $100 million of  deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated  other comprehensive income are expected to be
 reclassified to Net  income during  the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net  income .  Actual amounts ultimatelyreclassified
 to Net  income are  dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of May  31, 2017 ,  the maximumterm over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 
24 months.Fair Value Hedges
The
 Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by theCompany
 to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet theshortcut
 method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value ofthe
 underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Company’s fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which arereflected
 within the Cash  provided by operations component  of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The  Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rateswaps designated
 as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .  On October 15, 2015, the Company repaid the long-term debt which had previouslybeen hedged with these interest rate swaps. Accordingly, a 
s of May 31, 2017 , the Company had  no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges.Net Investment Hedges
The
 Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned internationaloperations.
 All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in Accumulated  other comprehensiveincome 
along  with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges withinthe 
Cash used by investing activities component  of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forwardrates.
 The  Company  recorded no ineffectiveness  from  net  investment  hedges  for  the  years  ended May  31, 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . The Company had no outstanding netinvestment hedges as of 
May 31, 2017 . 69

Table of ContentsUndesignated Derivative Instruments
The Company may elect to enter into forei
gn exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/orthe embedded derivative contracts. These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GA
AP. Accordingly, these undesignated instruments are recorded atfair
 value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in  Other  (income) expense, net , together
 with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlementfrom
 undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the Cash  provided by operations component  of theConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated
 derivative instruments was  $10.5 billion  as of  May 31, 2017 . Embedded Derivatives
As
 part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory’s acceptance of NIKE’s purchase order forcurrencies
 within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. Embedded derivative contracts aretreated as
 foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets
 with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in  Other (income) expense, net ,  from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through thedate the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations.
In
 addition, the Company has entered into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency ofeither
 substantial party to the contracts. These payment terms expose NIKE to variability in foreign exchange rates and create embedded derivative contracts that must bebifurcated
 from the related contract and recorded at fair value as derivative  assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding changes in fairvalue recognized in  
Other (income) expense, net until each payment is settled. At 
May 31, 2017 , the total notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $265 million . Credit Risk
The Company is exposed to
 credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions aremajor financial institutions with investment grade credit
 ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Company’s exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk islimited
 to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strictcounterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
The
 Company’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties’ creditworthiness andtheir
 ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company’s bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require theowing
 entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50  million should  the fair value of outstandingderivatives
 per counterparty be greater than $50  million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also triggercollateral
 requirements. As of  May  31, 2017 ,  the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and had derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent
 features in a net liability position of $59 million .  However, no derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position weregreater
 than $50  million by  counterparty. Accordingly, the  Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of  May 31, 2017 
,  the  Company  had  received   no  cash  collateral  from  various  counterparties  to  its  derivative  contracts  (refer  to   Note  6  —  Fair  Value  Measurements ).  Given  theconsiderations described above, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be 
immaterial . NOTE 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information
The
 Company’s operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions foroperations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each
 NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment.The
 Company’s  reportable  operating  segments  for  the  NIKE  Brand  are:  North  America,  Western  Europe,  Central  &  Eastern  Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  EmergingMarkets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands.
In
 June 2017, NIKE, Inc. announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizationalrealignme
nt, beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand will be: North America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Greater China;and Asia Pacific and Latin America.
The
 Company’s  NIKE  Brand  Direct  to  Consumer  (DTC)  operations  are,  and  will  continue  to  be,  managed  within  each  geographic  operating  segment.  Converse  is  also  areportable segment for the Company, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.
Global
 Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarilyrepresents
 NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and designexpenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand.
Corporate
 consists  largely  of  unallocated  general  and  administrative  expenses,  including  expenses  associated  with  centrally  managed  departments;  depreciation  andamortization
 related to the Company’s headquarters;  unallocated  insurance,  benefit  and compensation  programs, including stock-based  compensation;  and certain foreigncurrency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.

Table of ContentsThe
 primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as“EBIT”), which represents 
Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As
 part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brandentity
 in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasonsto
 which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summerselling
 seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for  geographic operatingsegments
 and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity’s functional currency. Differences betweenassigned
 standard  foreign  currency  rates  and  actual  market  rates  are  included  in  Corporate,  together  with  foreign  currency  hedge  gains  and  losses  generated  from  theCompany's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.
Accounts receivable, net 
, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures.

Exhibit 10.20COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
PARTIES:
Michael Spillane ("EMPLOYEE")
and
NIKE, Inc. 
, and its parent, divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns ("NIKE"):RECITALS:
A
This  Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement is executed upon EMPLOYEE's bona fide advancement withNIKE
 and is a condition of such advancement. Employee acknowledges that he/she was informed in  a written job offer atleast 
two  weeks  before  starting  work  in  his/her  new  position  that  this  Covenant  Not  to  Compete  and  Non-DisclosureAgreement is required and is a condition of advancement.
A.
Over  the  course  of  EMPLOYEE's  employment  with  NIKE,  EMPLOYEE  will  be  or  has  been  exposed  to  and/or  is  in  aposition
 to develop confidential information peculiar to NIKE's business and not generally known to the public as definedbelow
 ("Protected Information"). It is anticipated that EMPLOYEE will continue to be exposed to Protected Information ofgreater
 sensitivity  as  EMPLOYEE  advances  in  the  company,  and  this  Agreement  will  remain  in  effect  in  the  eventEMPLOYEE
 advances and until EMPLOYEE leaves the company or it is superseded by a new written agreement executedby the parties.
B.
The  nature  of  NIKE's  business  is  highly  competitive,  and  disclosure  of  any  Protected  Information  would  result  in  severedamage to NIKE and be difficult to measure.
C.
NIKE  makes use of its Protected Information throughout the world. Protected Information of NIKE can be used to NIKE'sdetriment anywhere in the world.
AGREEMENT:
In 
consideration of the foregoing, and the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows:1.
Covenant Not to Compete . (a)
Competition Restriction . During EMPLOYEE's employment by NIKE, under theterms
 of any employment contract or otherwise, and for one (1) year thereafter (the "Restriction Period"), EMPLOYEE willnot directly
 or indirectly own, manage, control or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be employed by,consult for
 or be connected in any manner with, any business engaged anywhere in the world in the athletic footwear, athleticapparel
 or sports equipment, sports electronics/technology and sports accessories business, or any other business that directlycompetes
 with NIKE or any of its parent, subsidiaries or affiliated corporations (a "Competitor"). This provision is subject toNIKE’s option to waive all or any porti

on of the Restriction Period as more specifically provided below.(b)
Extension  of  Time . In  the  event  EMPLOYEE  breaches  this  covenant  not  to  compete,  the  Restriction  Period  shallautomatically
 toll from the date of the first breach, and all subsequent breaches, until the resolution of the breach throughprivate settlement,
 judicial or other action, including all appeals. The Restriction Period shall continue upon the effective dateof
 any  such  settlement,  judicial  or  other  resolution.  NIKE  shall  not  be  obligated  to  pay  EMPLOYEE  the  additionalcompensation
 described  in  paragraph  1.1  below  during  any  period  of  time  in  which  this  Agreement  is  tolled  due  toEMPLOYEE’s
 breach. In the event EMPLOYEE receives such additional compensation after any such breach, EMPLOYEEmust immediately reimburse NIKE in the amount of all such compensation upon the receipt of a written request by NIKE.
(c)
Waiver  of Non-Compete . NIKE has the option, in its sole discretion, to elect to waive all or a portion of the RestrictionPeriod
 or to limit the definition of Competitor by giving EMPLOYEE seven (7) days' prior notice of such election. In theevent
 all  or  a  portion  of  the  Restriction  Period  is  waived  or  the  definition  of  Competitor  is  limited,  NIKE  shall  not  beobligated to pay EMPLOYEE for any period of time as to which the covenant not to compete has been waived.
(d)
Additional  Consideration . As  additional  consideration  for  the  covenant  not  to  compete  described  above,  should  NIKEterminate
 EMPLOYEE's  employment  without  cause  and  elect  to  enforce  the  non-competition  agreement,  while  theRestriction
 Period is in effect, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to one hundred percent (100%) ofEMPLOYEE’s
 last monthly base salary. Except where prohibited by law, if NIKE terminates EMPLOYEE for "cause," noadditional
 consideration will be owed to EMPLOYEE under this Agreement, and the covenant not to compete will remainenforceable.
 For  purposes  of  this  Agreement  only,  "cause"  shall  mean  (i)  insubordination,  (ii)  acts  of  dishonesty,  (iii)involvement
 in illegal activities where such involvement in illegal activities violates NIKE policies, places NIKE at risk orhas
 or  could  damage  NIKE's  reputation  in  the  community  or  any  of  its  related  or  subsidiary  companies,  (iv)  violation  ofNIKE's
 anti-harassment or anti-discrimination policy or (v) gross neglect of EMPLOYEE'S duties or willful misconduct that,in either case, results in economic harm to NIKE or harm to NIKE's reputation. Nothing in this paragraph or Agreement alters
the employment-at-will relationship between NIKE and EMPLOYEE.
If
 EMPLOYEE voluntarily terminates employment and NIKE elects to enforce the non-competition agreement, while theRestriction Period
 is in effect, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to the greater of fifty percent (50%) ofEMPLOYEE 
' s last monthly base salary or the equivalent of one-twelfth (1/12) of fifty percent of the median family incomefor
 a  four-person  family  in  the  state  where  EMPLOYEE  resides,  as  determined  by  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  for  the  mostrecent
 year available at the time of EMPLOYEE's termination. The first  payment to EMPLOYEE of additional considerationshall
 follow  on  the  last  business  day  of  the  month  after  NIKE's  election  to  enforce  the  non-competition  agreement.Subsequent
 payments  during  the  Restriction  Period  shall  be  payable  monthly  on the last  business  day  of  the  month  inaccordance with NIKE's payroll practices.
(e)
Withholding  and Offset .  NIKE reserves the right to withhold from Additional Consideration payable to EMPLOYEE allfederal,
 state and local taxes as shall be required, as well as any other amounts authorized or required by NIKE policy. NIKEreserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to reduce the amount of Additional

Consideration  by  amounts  that  EMPLOYEE  owes  NIKE,  including  but  not  limited  to  any  payments  due  to  NIKE  inaccordance with
 the NIKE Tax Equalization Policy if EMPLOYEE is employed as a transferee during his or her employmentwith
 NIKE.  Employee  agrees  that  notwithstanding  the  amount  of  any  withholding  and/or  offset,  even  in  an  amount  thatreduces
 payments of Additional Consideration to zero dollars ($0.00), the covenant not to compete will remain enforceable.To
 the  extent  withholding  or  offset  does  not  extinguish  amounts  that  EMPLOYEE  owes  to  NIKE,  EMPLOYEE  remainsobligated for the balance of the amounts owed.
2.
Subsequent Employer . EMPLOYEE agrees to notify NIKE at the time of separation of employment of the name of EMPLOYEE’snew
 employer,  if  known.  EMPLOYEE  further  agrees  to  disclose  to  NIKE  the  name  of  any  subsequent  employer  during  theRestriction Period, wherever located and regardless of whether such employer is a competitor of NIKE.
