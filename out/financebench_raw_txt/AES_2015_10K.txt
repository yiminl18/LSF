ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We were incorporated in 1981 
and are a diversified power generation and utility company organized into six market-oriented SBUs: US (United States),Andes 
(Chile, Colombia, and Argentina), Brazil , MCAC (Mexico, Central Americ a and Caribbean), Europe , and Asia . Item 1.— 
Business is an outline of our strat egy and our businesses by SBU, including key financial drivers. Additional items that may have an impact on ourbusinesses are discussed in It
em 1A.— Risk Factors and Item 3.— Legal Proceedings . Business Lines & SBUs 
— Within our six SBUs mentioned above, we have two lines of business. The first business line is generation, where we own and/oroperate power plants to gene
rate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. The second business line is utilities, wherewe own and/or 
operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial andgovernmental sectors with
in a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market. For each SBU,the following table summa
rizes our generation and utility businesses by capacity, number of facilities, utility customers and utility GWh sold.SBU

 26,912 proportional MW. Proportional MW is equal to gross MW of a generation facility multiplied by AES' equity ownership percentage in such facility.5

StrategyIn September 2011, we implemen
ted a new strategy to maximize value for our shareholders and over the last four years we have made significant progresstowards our goals by executing on the 
following pillars:•
Reducing Complexity. By exiting businesses and markets whe re we do not have a competitive advantage, we have simplified our portfolio and reduced risk.Over the past four years, we have so
ld assets to generate $3.4 billion in equity proceeds for AES, decreasing the total number of countries where we haveoperations from 28 to 17. We ex
ited Sri Lanka early in 2016, by selling our generation business, Kelanitissa, for $18 million. We exited several of thesemarkets, including Ukraine, Tu
rkey and Africa, at opportune times, as risks for these businesses have increased since the sales, which we believe wouldhave adversely impact
ed the valuations of such businesses. In 2015, we announced or closed $787 million in asset sales proceeds.•
Leveraging Our Platforms. We are focusing our growth on pla tform expansions in markets where we already operate and have a competitive advantage torealize attractive risk-adjusted return
s. We currently have 5,620 MW under construction. These projects represent $7 billion in total capital expenditures,with 85% of AES' $1.2 billion in equity alr
eady funded, and we expect the majority of these projects to come on-line through 2018. In 2015, we broughton-line five projects 
for a total of 1,484 MW. This capacity includes the 1,240 MW coal-fired Mong Duong 2 facility in Vietnam, which we completed sixmonths early and under budget.
•
Performance Excellence. We strive to be a low-cost manager of a portfolio of international energy assets and to derive synergies and scale from ourbusinesses. In 2011, we set a goal to redu
ce our G&A expenses by $200 million by 2015, and in 2014, we achieved these reductions one year early. Werecently launched a $150 m
illion cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative. This initiative will include overhead reductions, procurementefficiencies and ope
rational improvements. We expect to achieve at least $50 million in savings in 2016, ramping up to $150 million, including modestrevenue enhancements, in 2018.
•
Expanding Access to Capital. We have raised $2.5 billion in proceeds to AES by building strategic partnerships at the project and business level. Throughthese partnerships, we aim 
to optimize our risk-adjusted returns in our existing businesses and growth projects. By selling down portions of certainbusinesses, we can adjust our global 
exposure to commodity, fuel, country and macroeconomic risks. Partial sell-downs of our assets can serve to highlightthe value of businesses in our por
tfolio.•
Allocating Capital in a Disciplined Manner. Our top priority is to maxim ize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, which we achieve by investing ourdiscretionary cash and r
ecycling the capital we receive from asset sales and strategic partnerships. To that end, since September 2011 we have repurchased$1.5 billion of our shares and bene
fited from a low interest rate environment, by transacting on $24 billion in debt deals at the Parent and our subsidiaries.These debt transactions r
epresent $14 billion in refinancing and $10 billion in new financing, and we extended the maturities on $3.4 billion in Parent debt.
Note: Investments in subsidia
ries excludes $2.3 billion investment in DPL.Most recently, we increas
ed our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.11 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2016. This dividend increase reflects ourexpectation that we will 
maintain 10% annual growth in our dividend.6

GenerationWe currently own and/or oper
ate a generation portfolio of 29,352 MW, excluding the generation capabilities of our integrated utilities. Our generation fleet isdiversified by fuel type. Se
e discussion below under Fuel Costs . Performance drivers of o
ur generation businesses include types of electricity sales agreements, plant reliability and flexibility, fuel costs, fixed-costmanagement, sourcing and co
mpetition.Electricity Sales Contrac
ts — Our generation businesses sell electricity under medium- or long-term contracts ("contract sales") or under short-termagreements in competitive markets
 ("short-term sales").Contract Sales 
— Most of our generation fle et sells electricity under contracts. Our medium-term contract sales have a term of 2 to 5 years, while our long-term contracts have 
a term of more than 5 years. Across our portfolio, the average remaining contract term is 7 years.In contract sales, our gen
eration businesses recover variable costs including fuel and variable O&M costs, either through direct or indexation-basedcontractual pass-throughs o
r tolling arrangements. When the contract does not include a fuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or enter into fuel supplyagreements for a sim
ilar contract period (see discussion under the Fuel Costs section below). These contra cts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatility offuel prices and elec
tricity prices by linking the business's revenues and costs. These contracts also help us to fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of theproject through long-ter
m non-recourse project-level financing.Capacity Payments and Contract Sales 
— Most of our contract sales include a capacity payment that covers projected fixed costs of the plant, includingfixed O&M expenses and a return on 
capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity payment be denominated in thecurrency matching our f
ixed costs, including debt and return on capital invested. Although our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt, wetypically hedge a signif
icant portion of our exposure to variable interest rates. For foreign exchange, we generally structure the revenue of the business to match thecurrency of the debt and f
ixed costs. Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacity payment, which is discussed in more detailin the 
Capacity Payments and Short-Term Sales section below. Thus, these contracts, or othe
r related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to changes in power and fuel prices, currencyfluctuations and changes in 
interest rates. In addition, these contracts generally provide for a recovery of our fixed operating expenses and a return on ourinvestment, as long as we opera
te the plant to the reliability and efficiency standards required in the contract.Short-Term Sales 
— Our other generation businesses s ell power and ancillary services under short-term contracts with an average term of less than 2 years,including spot sales
, directly in the short-term market, or, in some cases, at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically administered by a systemoperator to coordinate d
ispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least expensive generation facilities, based upon variablecost or bid price, are disp
atched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last. The short-term price is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bidprice (the cost of the 
last plant required to meet system demand). As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive tofluctuations in the market 
price for electricity. In addition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operationof the transmission system. Ac
ross our portfolio, we provide a wide array of ancillary services, including voltage support, frequency regulation and spinningreserves.
In certain markets, such a
s Argentina and Kazakhstan, a regulator establishes the prices for electricity and fuel and adjusts them periodically for inflation,changes in fuel prices and o
ther factors. In these cases, our businesses are particularly sensitive to changes in regulation.Capacity Payments and Short-Term Sales 
— Many of the markets  in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capacity markets areintended to provide addition
al revenue based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are typicallypriced based on the cost of a n
ew entrant and the system capacity relative to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available in excess of peak demand).Our generating facilities selli
ng in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability in the market. Our most significantcapacity revenues ar
e earned by our generation capacity in Ohio and Northern Ireland.Plant Reliability and Fle
xibility — Our contract and short-te rm sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally manage availability, operatingefficiency and flexibility. 
Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In short-term sales, our plants must be reliableand flexible to captur
e peak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our flexibility allows us to capture ancillary service revenue whilemeeting local market needs.
Fuel Costs 
— For our thermal generat ion plants, fuel is a significant component of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we often enter into fuelsupply agreements to mat
ch the contract period, or we may hedge our fuel costs. Some7

of our contracts have periodic adjustments for changes in fuel cost indices. In those cases, we have fuel supply agreements with shorter terms to match thoseadjustments. For certain p
rojects, we have tolling arrangements where the power offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.In short-term sales, we se
ll power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel supply on a short-term basis, generally d
esigned to match up with our market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant for power prices, the economics ofprojects with short-term 
sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices. For further information regarding commodity price risk please see Item 7A.—Quantitative and Qualitative Dis
closures about Market Risk in this Form 10-K. 34% of our generation fle
et is coal-fired. In the U.S., most of our plants are supplied from domestic coal. At our non-U.S. generation plants and at our plantin Hawaii, we source coal inte
rnationally. Across our fleet, we utilize our global sourcing program to maximize the purchasing power of our fuel procurement.33% of our generation plants 
are fueled by natural gas. Generally, we use gas from local suppliers in each market. A few exceptions to this are AES Gener inChile, where we purchase import
ed gas from third parties, and our plants in the Dominican Republic, where we import LNG to utilize in the local market.28% of our generation plants 
are fueled by renewables, including hydro, wind and energy storage, which do not have significant fuel costs.5% of our generation fleet
 utilizes oil, diesel and petroleum coke ("pet coke") for fuel. Oil and diesel are sourced locally at prices linked to internationalmarkets, while pet coke is 
largely sourced from Mexico and the U.S.Renewable Generation Faciliti
es — We currently own and operat e 8,145 MW (4,237 proportional MW) of renewable generation, including hydro, wind,energy storage, solar, biom
ass and landfill gas.Seasonality, Weather Variations and E
conomic Activity — Our generation businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns throughout the year and,therefore, operating 
margin is not generated evenly by month during the year. Additionally, weather variations, including temperature, solar and wind resources,and hydrological conditions, m
ay also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. See Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis 
— Key Trends and Uncertainties of this Form 10-K for further de tails of the impact of dry hydrological conditions. In competitive markets for power,local economic act
ivity can also have an impact on power demand and short-term prices for power.Fixed-Cost Management 
— In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed operating and maintenance costs are recovered through thecapacity payment. However, fo
r all generation businesses, managing fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business performance.Competition 
— For our businesses with medium- or long -term contracts, there is limited competition during the term of the contract. For short-term sales,plant dispatch and the
 price of electricity are determined by market competition and local dispatch and reliability rules.Utilities
AES' eight utility businesses distr
ibute power to 10.5 million people in three countries. AES' two utilities in the U.S. also include generation capacity totaling6,524 MW. The utility businesses have 
a variety of structures, ranging from integrated utility to pure transmission and distribution businesses.In general, our utilit
ies sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. Key performance drivers for utilitiesinclude the regulated rate of
 return and tariff, seasonality, weather variations, economic activity, reliability of service and competition.Regulated Rate of Return and Tariff 
— In exchange for the  exclusive right to sell or distribute electricity in a franchise area, our utility businesses are subjectto government regulation
. This regulation sets the prices ("tariffs") that our utilities are allowed to charge retail customers for electricity and establishes servicestandards that we are requ
ired to meet.Our utilities are generally 
permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator based on the utility's allowed regulatory assetbase, capital structu
re and cost of capital. The asset base on which the utility is permitted a return is determined by the regulator and is based on the amount ofassets that are conside
red used and useful in serving customers. Both the allowed return and the asset base are important components of the utility's earning power.The allowed rate of retur
n and operating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are recovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to itscustomers.
The tariff may be rev
iewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regulations, or the utility may seek a change in its tariffs. Thetariff is general
ly based upon a certain usage level and may include a pass-through to the customer of costs that are not controlled by the utility, such as the costs offuel (in the case of integrate
d utilities) and/or the8

costs of purchased energy. In addition to fuel and purchased energy, other types of costs may be passed through to customers via an existing mechanism, such ascertain environment
al expenditures that are covered under an environmental tracker at our utility in Indiana, IPL. Components of the tariff that are directly passedthrough to the customer ar
e usually adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-based mechanism. In some regulatory regimes,customers with demand above an 
established level are unregulated and can choose to contract with other retail energy suppliers directly and pay a wheeling andother non-bypassable fees, which 
are fees to the distribution company for use of its distribution system.The regulated tarif
f generally recognizes that our utility businesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manage uncollectibleamounts, quality of servic
e and non-technical losses. Utilities, therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected in the tariff, or risk non-recovery of costs ordiminished returns.
Seasonality, Weather Variations and E
conomic Activity — Our utility businesses are a ffected by seasonal weather patterns throughout the year and, therefore,the operating revenues and 
associated operating expenses are not generated evenly by month during the year. Additionally, weather variations may also have animpact based on the number o
f customers, temperature variances from normal conditions and customers' historic usage levels and patterns. The retail kWh sales,after adjustments for weather
 variations, are affected by changes in local economic activity, energy efficiency and distributed generation initiatives, as well as thenumber of retail customers.
Reliability of Service 
— Our utility businesses must me et certain reliability standards, such as duration and frequency of outages. Those standards may bespecific with incentiv
es or penalties for performance against these standards. In other cases, the standards are implicit and the utility must operate to meet customerexpectations.
Competition 
— Our integrated utilit ies, such as IPL and DP&L, operate as the sole distributor of electricity within their respective jurisdictions. Ourbusinesses own
 and operate all of the businesses and facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. Competition in the regulated electricbusiness is primarily fro
m the on-site generation for industrial customers; however, in Ohio, customers in our service territory have the ability to switch toalternative supplie
rs for their generation service. Our integrated utilities, particularly DP&L, are exposed to the volatility in wholesale prices to the extent ourgenerating capacity 
exceeds the native load served under the regulated tariff and short-term contracts. See the full discussion under the US SBU.At our pure transmission and dist
ribution businesses, such as those in Brazil and El Salvador, we face relatively limited competition due to significantbarriers to entry. At many o
f these businesses, large customers, as defined by the relevant regulator, have the option to both leave and return to regulated service.Development and Construction
We develop and construct new gen
eration facilities. For our utility businesses, new plants may be built in response to customer needs or to comply withregulatory developments 
and are developed subject to regulatory approval that permits recovery of our capital cost and a return on our investment. For ourgeneration businesses, our prio
rity for development is platform expansion opportunities, where we can add on to our existing facilities in our key platform marketswhere we have a competitiv
e advantage. We make the decision to invest in new projects by evaluating the project returns and financial profile against a fair risk-adjusted return for the 
investment and against alternative uses of capital, including corporate debt repayment and share buybacks.In some cases, we enter into 
long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing construction. To limit required equity contributions fromThe AES Corporation, we also seek non-recours
e project debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners where it is commercially attractive. Forconstruction, we typically 
contract with a third party to manage construction, although our construction management team supervises the construction work andtracks progress against th
e project's budget and the required safety, efficiency and productivity standards.Environmental Matters
We are subject to var
ious international, federal, state, and local regulations in all of our markets. These regulations govern such items as the determination ofthe market mechanism for settin
g the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity.We are also subject to v
arious federal, state, regional and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among otherthings, the generation, stor
age, handling, use, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous and other materials intothe environment; and the h
ealth and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining and renewingpermits and other governm
ental authorizations from federal, state and local agencies. Violation of these laws, regulations or permits can result in substantial fines,other sanctions, suspension or revo
cation of permits and/or facility shutdowns. See later in Item 1.— Business — Environmental and Land-Use Regulations for further regulatory and 
environmental discussion.9

SBUsAll SBUs include generation faci
lities and three include utility businesses. The Company measures the operating performance of its SBUs using AdjustedPTC and Proportional Free Cash Flow, both of which are non-GAAP measur
es (see definitions below).AES' primary sources of Revenue, Operat
ing Margin, Adjusted PTC and Proportional Free Cash Flow are from generation and utility businesses. TheAdjusted PTC and Proportional Free Cash Flow by SBU for the year end
ed December 31, 2015 are shown below. The percentages fo r Adjusted PTC are thecontribution by each SBU to the gross me
tric, i.e., the total Adjusted PTC by SBU, before deductions for Corporate. See Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
of this Form 10-K for reconcil iation.
 
In 
2015 , approximately 80% of Adjusted PTC and Propor tional Free Cash Flow was contributed by our businesses in the Americas — including the US,Andes, Brazil and MCAC SBUs.
We define Adjusted PTC as pretax in
come from continuing operations attributable to AES excluding gains or losses due to (a) unrealized gains or lossesrelated to derivat
ive transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests,(d) losses due to impairm
ents, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted PTC in each SBU includes the effect of intercompany transactions withother SBUs other than interest and 
charges for certain management services.We define Proportional Fre
e Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities excluding capital expenditures related to service concession assets, lessmaintenance and non-re
coverable environmental capital costs, adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests. Proportional Free Cash Flow in eachSBU includes the effect of int
ercompany transactions with other SBUs except for interest, tax sharing, charges for management fees and transfer pricing.Our Organization and Segments
The segment reporting stru
cture uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages the businessinternally and is organi
zed by geographic regions which provide better socio-political-economic understanding of our business. The management reportingstructure is organized 
along six SBUs — US, Andes, Brazil, MCAC, Europe, and Asia — which are led by our SBU Presidents.Corporate and Other 
— For financial reporting pu rposes, the Company's corporate activities are reported within "Corporate and Other" because they do notrequire separate dis
closure under segment reporting accounting guidance. "Corporate and Other" also includes costs related to corporate overhead which are notdirectly associated wi
th the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self-insurance premiums which are fully eliminatedin consolidation. See Item 7.— 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financia l Condition and Results of Operations and Note 17 — Segment and GeographicInformation 
included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further dis cussion of the Company's segment structure(including information on 
revenue from external customers, Adjusted PTC—a non-GAAP measure, Proportional Free Cash Flow—a non-GAAP measure, and totalassets by segment) used for f

U.S. Utilities
IPALCO
Business Description 
— IPALCO owns all of the outstanding common stock of IPL. IPL is engaged primarily in generating, transmitting, distributing andselling electric 
energy to approximately 485,000 retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of Indiana. IPL has an exclusiveright to provide elect
ric service to those customers. IPL's service area covers about 528 square miles with an estimated population of approximately 934,000. IPLowns and operates four generat
ing stations. Two of the generating stations are primarily coal-fired; however, one of these stations is in the process of beingconverted to natural gas 
and will be fully converted in 2016. The third station has a combination of units that use coal (baseload capacity), natural gas and/or oil(peaking capacity) fo
r fuel to produce electricity. The fourth station is a small peaking station that uses gas-fired combustion turbine technology for the productionof electricity. IPL's ne
t electric generation capacity for winter is 3,233 MW and net summer capacity is 3,115 MW.On December 15, 2014, the Company executed 
an agreement with CDPQ, a long-term institutional investor headquartered in Quebec, Canada. Pursuant tothe agreement, CDPQ purchased 15% of AES US Investmen
ts, Inc. ("AES US Investments"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AES that owns 100% of IPALCO, for$247 million. This transact
ion closed on February 11, 2015. In addition, in April 2015, IPALCO received an equity capital contribution of $214 million from theissuance of 11,818,828 shares of common s
tock to CDPQ for funding needs primarily related to IPL's environmental construction program, which IPALCO thenmade the same investm
ent in IPL. After the April investment, CDPQ's direct and indirect ownership interests in IPALCO totaled 25%. CDPQ has committed toapproximately $134 mill
ion of additional investments in IPALCO through 2016, which will be used primarily to help fund existing environmental and replacementgeneration projects a
t IPL. Upon completion of these transactions, CDPQ's direct and indirect interests in IPALCO will total 30%, AES will own 85% of AES USInvestments, and AES US Investment will own 82.35% of 
IPALCO. There will be no change in management or operational control of AES US Investments orIPALCO as a result of these transac
tions.Market Structure 
— IPL is one of many transmission syst em owner members in the MISO. MISO is a RTO, which maintains functional control over thecombined transmission syste
ms of its members and manages one of the largest energy and ancillary services markets in the U.S. IPL offers the available electricityproduction of each of its gen
eration assets into the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets. MISO operates on a merit order dispatch, considering transmissionconstraints and other re
liability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO region.Regulatory Framework 
— Retail Ratemaking — In addition to the regula tions referred to below in Other Regulatory Matters , IPL is subject to regulation by the IURC with respect to IPL's services 
and facilities; retail rates and charges; the12

issuance of long-term securities; and certain other matters. The regulatory power of the IURC over IPL's business is both comprehensive and typical of thetraditional form of regulation
 generally imposed by state public utility commissions. IPL's tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic ratesand charges, which are set and 
approved by the IURC after public hearings. The IURC gives consideration to all allowable costs for ratemaking purposes includinga fair return on the f
air value of the utility property used and useful in providing service to customers. In addition, IPL's rates include various adjustmentmechanisms including, but not 
limited to: (i) a rider to reflect changes in fuel and purchased power costs to meet IPL's retail load requirements, referred to as theFAC, and (ii) a rider for the t
imely recovery of costs incurred to comply with environmental laws and regulations referred to as ECCRA. These componentsfunction somewhat independent
ly of one another, but the overall structure of IPL's rates and charges would be subject to review at the time of any review of IPL'sbasic rates and charges. 
IPL's basic rates and charges were last adjusted in 1996; however, IPL filed a petition with the IURC on December 29, 2014 for authorityto increase its basic 
rates and charges. IPL's proposed rate increase, filed as part of IPL's rebuttal testimony in this proceeding, is $63.3 million, or 5.2%. An orderon this proceeding will like
ly be issued by the IURC early in 2016.Environmental Matters 
— MATS — In April 2012, the EPA's rule to establish maximum achievable control technology standards for each hazardous airpollutant regulated unde
r the CAA emitted from coal and oil-fired power plants, known as MATS, became effective. On August 14, 2013, the IURC approved IPL's MATS plan, which includes investing up to $511 mi
llion in the installation of new pollution control equipment on IPL's five largest baseload generatingunits. These coal-fired un
its are located at IPL's Petersburg and Harding Street generating stations. The IURC also approved IPL's request to recover operating andconstruction costs for this 
equipment, including a return, through a rate adjustment mechanism with certain stipulations. Funding for these capital expenditures isexpected to be obtained f
rom additional debt financing at IPL; equity contributions; borrowing capacity on IPL's committed credit facilities; and cash generatedfrom operating activities.
Replacement Generation 
— IPL has several generating un its that are expected to retire or refuel by 2017. These units are primarily coal-fired and represent472 MW of net capacity in to
tal. To replace this generation, IPL filed a petition and case-in-chief with the IURC in April 2013 seeking a CPCN to build a 550 to725 MW CCGT at its Eagle Valley Station si
te in Indiana and to refuel Harding Street Station Units 5 and 6 from coal to natural gas (approximately 100 MW netcapacity each). In May 2014, 
IPL received an order on the CPCN from the IURC authorizing the refueling project and granting approval to build a 644 to 685 MWCCGT at a total budget of $649 million. Th
e current estimated cost of these projects is $632 million. IPL requested and was granted authority to accrue post in-service allowance for d
ebt and equity funds used during construction, and to defer the recognition of depreciation expense of the CCGT and refueling project untilsuch time that IPL is allowed 
to collect both a return and depreciation expense of the CCGT and refueling projects. The CCGT is expected to be placed into servicein April 2017, and the refueling p
roject is expected to be completed by early 2016. The costs to build and operate the CCGT and for the refueling project, otherthan fuel costs, will not be r
ecoverable by IPL through rates until the conclusion of a base rate case proceeding with the IURC after the assets have been placed inservice. In October 2014, IPL fil
ed a petition and case-in-chief with the IURC seeking a CPCN to refuel Harding Street Station Unit 7 from coal to natural gas(about 410 MW net capacity
). On July 29, 2015 IPL received approval for this CPCN from the IURC. This conversion is part of IPL's overall wastewatercompliance plan for i
ts power plants and is expected to be completed in 2016 (as discussed in Environmental Wastewater Requirements below). Environmental Wastewater Requirements 
— In August 2012, the IDEM issued NPDES permits to the IPL Petersbu rg, Harding Street, and Eagle Valleygenerating stations, which be
came effective in October 2012. In April 2013, IPL received an extension to the compliance deadline through September 2017 forIPL's Harding Street and Petersburg f
acilities through agreed orders with IDEM. IPL conducted studies to determine the operational changes and/or controlequipment necessary to co
mply with the new limitations. On October 16, 2014, IPL filed its wastewater compliance plans with the IURC. On July 29, 2015, IPLreceived approval for 
a CPCN from the IURC to convert Unit 7 at the Harding Street Station from coal-fired to natural gas-fired, and also to install and operatewastewater treatmen
t technologies at Harding Street Station and Petersburg Generation Station in southern Indiana. IPL plans to invest $326 million in theseprojects to help ensure co
mpliance with the wastewater treatment requirements by 2017. Recovery of these costs is expected through an Indiana statute whichallows for 80% recovery of qua
lifying costs through a rate adjustment mechanism with the remainder recorded as a regulatory asset to be considered for recoveryin the next basic rate 
case proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that IPL would be successful in that regard.Key Financial Drivers 
— IPL's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand and rate base growth. Retail demand is influenced by localmacroeconomic condit
ions. In addition, weather, energy efficiency and wholesale prices could also impact financial results. IPL's rate base growth is influenced bythe timely recovery o
f capital expenditures, as well as passage of new legislation or implementation of regulations.Construction and Development 
— IPL's construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for prudent utility operations and compliancewith environmental laws and r
egulations, along with discretionary investments designed to replace aging equipment or improve overall performance. Please seeabove for a description of ou
r major construction projects.13

DPL Inc. ("DPL")Business Description 
— DPL is an energy holding company whose princip al subsidiaries include DP&L, DPLE, and DPLER.DP&L generates, transmits, dis
tributes and sells electricity to approximately 517,000 customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio. DP&L,solely or through jointly owned fa
cilities, owns 2,510 MW of generation capacity and numerous transmission facilities.DPLE owns peaking generation units repres
enting 556 MW located in Ohio and Indiana.DPLER, a competitive retail 
marketer, sells retail electricity to more than 124,000 retail customers in Ohio and Illinois. Approximately 110,000 of thesecustomers are also dist
ribution customers of DP&L in Ohio. On January 1, 2016, DPL closed on the sale of DPLER to Interstate Gas Supply, Inc. (IGS).Market Structure 
— Since January 2001, electri c customers within Ohio have been permitted to choose to purchase power under a contract with a CRESProvider or to continue to purch
ase power from their local utility under SSO rates established by the tariff. DP&L and other Ohio utilities continue to have theexclusive right to provide d
elivery service in their state certified territories, and DP&L had the obligation to supply retail generation service to customers that donot choose an alternativ
e supplier. Beginning in 2014, a portion of the SSO generation supply is no longer supplied by DP&L but is provided by third partiesthrough a competitive bid p
rocess. A total of 10% and 60% of the SSO load was sourced through competitive bid in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and 100% will besourced in this manner beginn
ing in 2016, respectively. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over DP&L's delivery of electricity, SSO and other retail electricservices. The PUCO has issued extensive rul
es on how and when a customer can switch generation suppliers, how the local utility will interact with CRESProviders and customers, includ
ing for billing and collection purposes, and which elements of a utility's rates are "bypassable" (i.e., avoided by a customer thatelects a CRES Provider) and which ele
ments are "non-bypassable" (i.e., charged to all customers receiving a distribution service irrespective of what entityprovides the retail gen
eration service).PJM Operations 
— DP&L is a member of PJM. The PJM RTO operates the t ransmission systems owned by utilities operating in all or parts ofPennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delawa
re, D.C., Virginia, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. PJM has anintegrated planning proc
ess to identify potential needs for additional transmission to be built to avoid future reliability problems. PJM also runs the day-ahead andreal-time energy markets, ancillary 
services market and forward capacity market for its members.As a member of PJM, DP&L is also subject to 
charges and costs associated with PJM operations as approved by the FERC. Prior to 2015, the RPM wasPJM's capacity construct. In 2015, PJM imp
lemented a new Capacity Price ("CP") program, replacing the RPM model. The CP program offers the potential forhigher capacity revenues,
 combined with substantially increased penalties for non-performance or under-performance during certain periods identified as "capacityperformance hours." This link
age between non- or under-performance during certain specific hours means that a generation unit that is generally performing wellon an annual basis, may incur subst
antial penalties if it happens to be unavailable for service during some capacity performance hours. Similarly, a generation unitthat is generally per
forming poorly on an annual basis may avoid such penalties if its outages happen to occur only during hours that are not capacity performancehours. An annual “stop-loss” provision ex
ists that limits the size of penalties to 150% of the net cost of new entry, which is a value computed by PJM. This level islikely to be larger th
an the capacity price established under the CP program, so that the potential exists that participation in the CP program could result in capacitypenalties that exce
ed capacity revenues. The purpose of the RPM and CP Program is to enable PJM to obtain sufficient resources to reliably meet the needs ofelectric custome
rs within the PJM footprint. PJM conducts an auction to establish the price by zone.The PJM CP auctions are held three ye
ars in advance for a period covering 12 months starting from June 1. Auctions for the period covering June 1, 2019through May 30, 2020 are expected to 
take place in May 2016. Future auction results are dependent upon various factors including the demand and supplysituation, capacity add
itions and retirements and any changes in the current auction rules related to bidding for demand response and energy efficiency resources inthe capacity auctions. For DPL-owned gen
eration, applicable capacity prices through the auction year 2018/19 are as follows:Auction Year (June 01-May 31)
 2018/19  2017/18  2016/17  2015/16  2014/15  2013/14 Capacity Clearing Price ($/MW-Day)
 $165  $152  $134  $136  $126  $28 The computed average cap
acity prices by calendar year are as follows:Year
 2018  2017  2016  2015  2014 Computed Average Capacity Price ($/MW-Day)
 $159  $145  $135  $132  $85 The above tables reflect the
 capacity prices after the transitional auctions discussed earlier. Substantially all of DP&L's capacity cleared in the CPauction. The results of thes
e auctions could have a significant effect on DP&L's revenues in the future.14

According to the terms of DP&L's RPM rider, a portion of the capacity revenue is credited to SSO customers primarily based on the load still being served tothe SSO customers. However, with the transi
tion to market, no amount will be credited beginning January 1, 2016.Regulatory Framework 
— Retail Regulation — DP&L is subject to regulation by th e PUCO, for its distribution services and facilities, retail rates andcharges, reliability of service
, compliance with renewable energy portfolio, energy efficiency program requirements and certain other matters. DP&L's rates forelectric servic
e to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges that are set and approved by the PUCO after public hearings. In addition, DP&L's rates includevarious adjustment mech
anisms including, but not limited to, those to reflect changes in fuel costs to generate electricity or purchased power prices, and the timelyrecovery of costs incurr
ed to comply with alternative energy, renewables, energy efficiency, and economic development costs. These components functionindependently of one another, bu
t the overall structure of DP&L's retail rates and charges are subject to the rules and regulations established by the PUCO.Retail Rate Structure 
— Since Ohio is deregulated and a llows customers to choose retail generation providers, DP&L is required to provide retail generationservice at SSO rates to any custo
mer that has not signed a contract with a CRES provider. SSO rates are subject to rules and regulations of the PUCO and areestablished based on DP&L's Electr
ic Security Plan ("ESP") filing. DP&L's wholesale transmission rates are regulated by the FERC. DP&L's distribution rates areregulated by the PUCO and are establ
ished through a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. DP&L is permitted to recover its costs of providing distributionservice as well as earn 
a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator, based on the utility's allowed regulated asset base, capital structure and costof capital.
The terms and conditions of DP&L's cur
rent SSO are provided under the ESP filed in 2012 and approved by the PUCO order dated September 4, 2013("2012 ESP"). The 2012 ESP has been in effect since J
anuary 2014 and allows DP&L to collect a non-bypassable Service Stability Rider ("SSR") equal to $110million per year fro
m 2014 - 2016. It allowed for DP&L to recover its PJM-related transmission charges, alternative energy costs, fuel and purchased power costs,and established a SEET ("Signific
ant Excessive Earnings Test") threshold of 12% ROE. It also required DP&L to conduct competitive bid auctions to procuregeneration supply for SSO service. DP&L's own gener
ation was phased-out of supplying SSO service over the three year period. Beginning January 1, 2016DP&L's SSO will be 100% sourced through the competi
tive bid. For calendar years 2012 - 2014, DP&L was subject to a SEET threshold and was required to applygeneral rules for calculating ear
nings and comparing them to a comparable group to determine whether there were significantly excessive earnings during a givencalendar year. Through the 2012 ESP, the PUCO establ
ished DP&L's ROE SEET threshold at 12%. On May 15, 2014, DP&L filed its application to demonstratethat it did not have signif
icantly excessive earnings for calendar year 2013. A stipulation was reached with the PUCO staff agreeing that DP&L did not exceed theSEET threshold for 2014. A hearing was held and th
e PUCO issued an order approving the SEET stipulation. In future years, the SEET could have a material effecton results of operations, fin
ancial condition and cash flows.On October 30, 2015 DP&L publicly announced its int
ent to file an application to increase its distribution rates at the PUCO. On November 30, 2015 DP&Lfiled its distribution 
rate case using a 12-month test year of June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016 to measure revenue and expenses and a date certain of September 30,2015 to measure its asset bas
e. The Company is seeking an increase to distribution revenues of $66 million per year. The Company has asked for recovery ofcertain regulatory 
assets as well as two new riders that would allow the Company to recover certain costs on an ongoing basis. It has proposed a modified straight-fixed variable rate design i
n an effort to decouple distribution revenues from electric sales. If approved as filed the rates are expected to have a total bill impact ofapproximately 4% on a t
ypical residential customer.On February 22, 2016 DP&L filed an ESP that would be in eff
ect beginning January 1, 2017. As part of this filing, DP&L is seeking a Reliable ElectricityRider for 10 years, based on the va
riance between the proposed revenue requirement and the actual revenues net of operating costs of the generation units.  Thisplan establishes the te
rms and conditions for DP&L's Standard Service Offer (SSO) beginning June 1, 2017 to customers that do not choose a competitive retailelectric supplier.  
In its plan, DP&L recommends including renewable energy attributes as part of the product that is competitively bid, and seeks recovery ofapproximately $10 mill
ion of regulatory assets.  The plan also proposes a new Distribution Investment Rider to allow DP&L to recover costs associated with futuredistribution equipment and 
infrastructure needs.  Additionally, the plan establishes new riders set initially at zero, related to energy reductions from DP&L's energyefficiency programs, 
and certain environmental liabilities the Company may incur. There can be no assurance that the ESP will be approved as filed or on a timelybasis, and if the ESP is not approved on a t
imely basis or the final ESP provides for terms that are more adverse than those submitted in DP&L’s application, theCompany's consolidated results of op
erations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially impacted.Environmental Matters 
— In relation to MATS, 3,066 MW of DPL's generation capacity is largely compliant with MATS, and DPL does not expect to incurmaterial capit
al expenditures to ensure compliance with MATS. For more information see Item 1. — United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislat ion andRegulations 
. 15

Key Financial Drivers — Although recent ESP and Generation Separ ation decisions provide some clarity on the underlying drivers through 2016, challengesremain for DPL beyond 2016 including the po
tential impacts of retail demand, weather, energy efficiency and wholesale prices on financial results. In addition,through 2016, DPL financial results a
re likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following:•
PJM capacity prices auctioned already•
Non-bypassable revenue: $110 million in 2014 and 2015 and allowed to earn $110 million annually in 2016•
Operational performance of generation facilitiesBeyond 2016, DPL financial drivers includ
e many factors, such as the following:•
PJM capacity prices•
Recovery in the power market, particularly as it relates to an expansion in dark spreads•
Sale or transfer to a DPL affiliate of DP&L generation assets•
DPL's ability to reduce its cost structureSee Item 1A.— 
Risk Factors for additional discussion on DPL. Construction and Development 
— Planned construction additions p rimarily relate to new investments in and upgrades to DP&L's power plant equipment andtransmission and distribut
ion system. Capital projects are subject to continuing review and are revised in light of changes in financial and economic conditions,load forecasts, legisl
ative and regulatory developments and changing environmental standards, among other factors.DPL is projecting to spend an estim
ated $439 million in capital projects for the period 2016 through 2018 with 61% attributable to Transmission andDistribution. DPL's ability to compl
ete capital projects and the reliability of future service will be affected by its financial condition, the availability of internalfunds and the reasonable cost o
f external funds. We expect to finance these construction additions with a combination of cash on hand, short-term financing, long-term debt and cash flows fro
m operations.U.S. Generation
Business Description 
— In the U.S., we own a diversified genera tion portfolio in terms of geography, technology and fuel source. The principal markets andlocations where we are engag
ed in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) are the WECC, PJM, SPP and Hawaii. AES Southland, in theWECC, is our most significant gene
rating business.AES Southland
Business Description 
— In terms of aggregate installed capacity, AES Southland is one of the largest generation operators in California, with an installedcapacity of 3,941 MW, account
ing for approximately 5% of the state's installed capacity and 17% of the peak demand of Southern California Edison. The threecoastal power plants compr
ising AES Southland are in areas that are critical for local reliability and play an important role in integrating the increasing amounts ofrenewable generation r
esources in California.Market Structure 
— All of AES Southland's capacity is contr acted through a long-term agreement (the “Tolling Agreement”), which expires in mid-2018.Under the Tolling Agreement, AES Southland's l
argest revenue driver is unit availability, as approximately 97% of its revenue comes from availability-relatedpayments. Historically, AES Southland has g
enerally met or exceeded its contractual availability requirements under the Tolling Agreement and may capturebonuses for exceeding avail
ability requirements in peak periods.The offtaker under the Tol
ling Agreement provides gas to the three facilities at no cost; therefore, AES Southland is not exposed to significant fuel price risk.AES Southland does, however, guarantee the e
fficiency of each unit so that any fuel consumed in excess of what would have been consumed had the guaranteedefficiency been ach
ieved is paid for by AES Southland. Additionally, if the units operate at an efficiency better than the guaranteed efficiency, AES Southland getscredit for the gas tha
t is not consumed. The business is also exposed to the cost of replacement power for a limited time period if any of the plants are dispatched bythe offtaker and are not a
ble to meet the required dispatch schedule for generation of electric energy.AES Southland delivers electri
city into the California ISO's market through its Tolling Agreement counterparty.Re-powering 
— In October 2014, AES Southland was awarded 20-year con tracts by SCE to provide 1,284 MW of combined cycle gas-fired generation and100 MW of interconnected ba
ttery-based energy storage. In addition to replacing older gas-fired plants with more efficient gas-fired capacity, SCE chose advancedenergy storage as a cost e
ffective way to ensure critical power system reliability. This new storage resource will provide unmatched operational flexibility, enablingthe most
16

efficient dispatch of other generating plants, lowering cost and emissions and supporting the on-going addition of renewable power sources.This new capacity will be buil
t at the Company's existing power plant sites in Huntington Beach and Alamitos Beach. For the gas-fired capacity, financingagreements are expe
cted to be finalized in 2016 with construction expected to begin in 2017, and commercial operation scheduled for 2020. For the energy storagecapacity, commercial operation is
 scheduled for 2021.AES is pursuing permits to build both the g
as-fired and energy storage capacity and will complete the licensing process before financial close. The total costfor these projects is exp
ected to be approximately $1.9 billion, which will be funded with a combination of non-recourse debt and AES equity.Regulatory Framework 
— Environmental Matters — For a discussion of environmenta l regulatory matters affecting U.S. Generation, see Item 1. —United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regu
lations.Key Financial Drivers 
— AES Southland's contractual avail ability is the single most important driver of operations. Its units are generally required toachieve at least 86% availability
 in each contract year. AES Southland has historically met or exceeded its contractual availability.Additional U.S. Generation Businesses
Business Description 
— Additional businesses include th ermal and wind generating facilities, of which AES Hawaii and our U.S. wind generation businessare the most significant.
Many of our U.S. generation plants provid
e baseload operations and are required to maintain a guaranteed level of availability. Any change in availability hasa direct impact on financial perf
ormance. The plants are generally eligible for availability bonuses on an annual basis if they meet certain requirements. In additionto plant availabili
ty, fuel cost is a key business driver for some of our facilities.AES Hawaii 
— AES Hawaii receives a fuel paym ent from its offtaker under a PPA expiring in 2022, which is based on a fixed rate indexed to the GNPIPD.Since the fuel payment is no
t directly linked to market prices for fuel, the risk arising from fluctuations in market prices for coal is borne by AES Hawaii.To mitigate the risk f
rom such fluctuations, AES Hawaii has entered into fixed-price coal purchase commitments that end in December 2018; the businesscould be subject to variab
ility in coal pricing beginning in January 2019. To mitigate fuel risk beyond December 2018, AES Hawaii plans to seek additional fuelpurchase commitments on 
favorable terms. However, if market prices rise and AES Hawaii is unable to procure coal supply on favorable terms, the financialperformance of AES Hawaii could be 
materially and adversely affected.US Wind 
— AES has 773 MW of wind capacity in the U.S., locat ed in California, Texas and West Virginia. In July 2015, AES sold its interest in ArmeniaMountain, a wind project loca
ted in Pennsylvania with an installed capacity of 101 MW. Typically, these facilities sell under long-term PPAs. AES financed mostof these projects with tax 
equity structures. The tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes that varyover the life of the pro
jects. Based on certain liquidation provisions of the tax equity structures, this could result in a net loss to AES consolidated results in periodsin which the faciliti
es report net income. These non cash net losses will be expected to reverse during the life of the facilities. Some of the wind projects areexposed to the volatilit
y of energy prices and their revenue may change materially as energy prices fluctuate in their respective markets of operations.Buffalo Gap is located in Texas 
and is comprised of three wind projects with an aggregate generation capacity of 524 MW. Each wind project operates itsown PPA with the exception of Buffalo Gap III whose PPA expired 
in December 2015. The energy price of the entire production of Buffalo Gap I is guaranteed bya PPA expiring in 2021. The PPA of Buffalo Gap II guarante
es the energy price of 80% of the installed capacity while the energy price for the remaining 20% isdictated by the prices 
in the ERCOT market. The PPA of Buffalo Gap II expires in December 2017. Once the PPAs expire, the entire installed capacity of BuffaloGap will be exposed to the volati
lity of energy prices in the ERCOT market which could adversely affect revenues.Laurel Mountain is a wind proje
ct located in West Virginia with an installed capacity of 98 MW. Laurel Mountain does not operate under a long-termcontract and sells its 
entire capacity and power generated into the PJM market. The volatility and fluctuations of energy prices in PJM have a direct impact in theresults of Laurel Mountain.
AES manages the wind portfolio as par
t of its broader investments in the U.S., leveraging operational and commercial resources to supplement theexperienced subject m
atter experts in the wind industry to achieve optimal results.Market Structure 
— Coal is one of the primary fu els used by our U.S. generation facilities that has international prices set by market factors, although theprice of the other pri
mary fuel, natural gas is generally set domestically. Price variations for these fuels can change the composition of generation costs and energyprices in our generation bus
inesses, and the prices of these fuels have been subject to volatility in recent years. Many of these generation businesses have enteredinto long-term
17

PPAs with utilities or other offtakers. Some coal-fired power plant businesses in the U.S. with PPAs have mechanisms to recover fuel costs from the offtaker,including an energy payment 
that is partially based on the market price of coal. In addition, these businesses often have an opportunity to increase or decreaseprofitability from p
ayments under their PPAs depending on such items as plant efficiency and availability, heat rate, ability to buy coal at lower costs through AES'global sourcing program and fu
el flexibility. Revenue may change materially as prices in fuel markets fluctuate, but the variable margin or profitability should notbe materially chang
ed when market price fluctuations in fuel are borne by the offtaker.Regulatory Framework 
— Several of our generation bus inesses in the U.S. currently operate as QFs as defined under the PURPA. These businesses enteredinto long-term contra
cts with electric utilities that had a mandatory obligation under PURPA requirements to purchase power from QFs at the utility's avoided cost(i.e., the likely costs fo
r both energy and capital investment that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own generatingcapacity or purchase i
t from another source). To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercialprocess or heating or cooling 
applications in certain proportions to the facility's total energy output and meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a smallpower production facility 
must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria.Our non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. curr
ently operate as EWG as defined under EPAct 1992. These businesses, subject to approval of FERC, havethe right to sell po
wer at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrialcustomer. Under the FPA and FERC's regulations, approva
l from FERC to sell wholesale power at market-based rates is generally dependent upon a showing toFERC that the seller lacks ma
rket power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect other barriers to market entry and that there isno opportunity for abusive trans
actions involving regulated affiliates of the seller. To prevent market manipulation, FERC requires sellers with market-based rateauthority to file ce
rtain reports, including a triennial updated market power analysis for markets in which they control certain threshold amounts of generation.Other Regulatory Matters 
— The U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both federal regulation,as implemented by the U.S. FERC, and regional 
regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the RTOs, non-profit corporations that operate theregional transmission gri
d and maintain organized markets for electricity. These rules for the most part govern such items as the determination of the marketmechanism for setting 
the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity. See Item 1A.—Risk Factors 
for additional discussion on U.S. regul atory matters.Our businesses are subject to e
mission regulations, which may result in increased operating costs or the purchase of additional pollution control equipment ifemission levels are ex
ceeded. Our businesses periodically review their obligations for compliance with environmental laws, including site restoration andremediation. Because of t
he uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future costs of compliance or remediation could behigher or lower than the amoun
t currently accrued, if any. For a discussion of environmental laws and regulations affecting the U.S. business, see Item 1.— US Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations 
. Key Financial Drivers 
— U.S. Generation's financial resu lts are driven by fuel costs and outages. The Company has entered into long-term fuel contracts tomitigate the risks asso
ciated with fluctuating prices. In addition, major maintenance requiring units to be off-line is performed during periods when power demandis typically lower. The fin
ancial results of US Wind are primarily driven by increased production due to faster and less turbulent wind, and reduced turbine outages.In addition, PJM and ERCOT power prices impact 
financial results for the wind projects that are operating without long-term contracts for all or some of theircapacity.
Construction and Development 
— Planned capital projec ts include the AES Southland re-powering described above. In addition to the new constructionprojects, U.S. Generation perfor
ms capital projects related to major plant maintenance, repairs, and upgrades to be compliant with new environmental laws andregulations.

Andes Businesses
Chile
Business Description 
— In Chile, through AES Gener, we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) in the two principalmarkets: the SIC and SING. In terms of 
aggregate installed capacity, AES Gener is the second largest generation operator in Chile with a calculated installedcapacity of 3,581 MW, excluding 
energy storage and TermoAndes, and a market share of 17.7% as of December 31, 2015.AES Gener owns a diversified generat
ion portfolio in Chile in terms of geography, technology, customers and fuel source. AES Gener's installed capacity islocated near the prin
cipal electricity consumption centers, including Santiago, Valparaiso and Antofagasta. AES Gener's diverse generation portfolio, composed ofhydroelectric, coal, g
as, diesel and biomass facilities, allows the businesses to operate under a variety of market and hydrological conditions, manage AES Gener'scontractual obligat
ions with regulated and unregulated customers and, as required, provide backup spot market energy. AES Gener has experienced significantgrowth in recent years respond
ing to market opportunities with the completion of nine generation projects totaling approximately 1,861 MW, including the 152MW Unit 5 of Guacolda completed 
in December 2015, and increasing AES Gener's installed capacity by 55% from 2006 to 2015. Additionally, we areconstructing an additiona
l 1,104 MW, comprised of the 21 MW Andes Solar and 20 MW Cochrane Energy Storage in the SING, the 532 MW coal-fired Cochraneplant in the SING and the 531 MW Alto Maipo run
-of-the-river hydroelectric plant in the SIC.In Chile, we align AES Gener's contracts 
to reduce the risk and improve margins, contracting a significant portion of their baseload capacity, currently coaland hydroelectric, under 
long-term contracts with a diversified customer base, including both regulated and unregulated customers. AES Gener reserves its highervariable cost units as des
ignated backup facilities, principally the diesel- and gas-fired units in Chile, for sales to the spot market during scarce system supplyconditions, such as
20

dry hydrological conditions and plant outages. In Chile, sales on the spot market are made only to other generation companies that are members of the relevantCDEC at the system marginal cost.
AES Gener currently has long-ter
m contracts, with average terms of 13 to 16 years, with regulated distribution companies and unregulated customers, suchas mining and industrial co
mpanies. In general, these long-term contracts include both fixed and variable payments along with indexation mechanisms thatperiodically adjust pr
ices based on the generation cost structure related to the CPI, the international price of coal, and in some cases, with pass-through of fuel andregulatory costs, including 
changes in law.In addition to energy paymen
ts, AES Gener also receives firm capacity payments for contributing to the system's ability to meet peak demand. Thesepayments are added to the 
final electricity price paid by both unregulated and regulated customers. In each system, the CDEC annually determines the firmcapacity amount allo
cated to each power plant. A plant's firm capacity is defined as the capacity that it can guarantee at peak hours during critical conditions, suchas droughts, taking into account s
tatistical information regarding maintenance periods and water inflows in the case of hydroelectric plants. The capacity price isfixed by the CNE in the semiannual nod
e price report and indexed to the CPI and other relevant indices.During November, 2015, AES successfully comple
ted the sale of 4% interest in AES Gener S.A. through its direct shareholder Inversiones Cachagua S.p.A.("Cachagua") through a privat
e auction. The strategic rationale of this sale was to increase the liquidity of the AES Gener's Share and its exposure on internationalmarkets. As a result of this 
transaction AES now owns 66.7% of AES Gener.Market Structure 
— Chile has two main power systems, la rgely as a result of its geographic shape and size. The SIC is the largest of these systems, with aninstalled capacity o
f 15,911 MW as of December 31, 2015. The SIC serves approximately 92% of the Chilean population, including the densely populated SantiagoMetropolitan Region, and repr
esents 74% of the country's electricity demand. The SING serves about 6% of the Chilean population, representing 25% of Chile'selectricity consump
tion, and is mostly oriented toward mining companies.In 2015, thermoelectri
c generation represented 62% of the total generation in Chile. In the SIC, thermoelectric generation represents 50% of installedcapacity, required to fulfill 
demand not satisfied by hydroelectric output and is critical to guaranteeing reliable and dependable electricity supply under dryhydrological conditions. In th
e SING, which includes the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, thermoelectric capacity represents 96% of installedcapacity. The fuels used fo
r generation, mainly coal, diesel and LNG, are indexed to international prices.In the SIC, where hydroelectri
c plants represent a large part of the system's installed capacity, hydrological conditions largely influence plant dispatch and,therefore, spot marke
t prices, given that river flow volumes, melting snow and initial water levels in reservoirs largely determine the dispatch of the system'shydroelectric and the
rmoelectric generation plants. Rainfall and snowfall occur in Chile principally in the southern cone winter season (June to August) and duringthe remainder of the y
ear precipitation is scarce. When rain is abundant, energy produced by hydroelectric plants can amount to more than 70% of total generation.In 2015 hydroelectric gene
ration represented 45% of total energy production.Regulatory Framework 
— Electricity Regulation — The government entity tha t has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system is the Ministryof Energy, acting direct
ly or through the CNE and the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels. The electricity sector is divided into three segments: generation,transmission and distribut
ion. In general terms, generation and transmission expansion are subject to market competition, while transmission operation anddistribution, are subjec
t to price regulation. The transmission segment consists of companies that transmit the electricity produced by generation companies at highvoltage. Companies that ar
e owners of a trunk transmission system, generally high voltage transmission lines with capacity of 220 Kv and higher (with bi-directional flows and re
levant number of users), cannot participate in the generation or distribution segments.Companies in the SIC and the SING that possess gene
ration, transmission, sub-transmission or additional transmission facilities, as well as unregulatedcustomers directly conn
ected to transmission facilities, are coordinated through the CDEC, which minimizes the operating costs of the electricity system, whilemeeting all service quality an
d reliability requirements. The principal purpose of the CDEC is to ensure that the most efficient electricity generation available tomeet demand is dispatch
ed to customers. The CDEC dispatches plants in merit order based on their variable cost of production which allows for electricity to besupplied at the lowest avai
lable cost.All generators can comm
ercialize energy through contracts with distribution companies for their regulated and unregulated customers or directly withunregulated customers. Unregu
lated customers are customers whose connected capacity is higher than 2 MW. By law, both regulated and unregulated customersare required to purchase all
 of their electricity requirements under contract. Generators may also sell energy to other power generation companies on a short-termbasis. Power generation compani
es may engage in contracted sales among themselves at negotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chile, undercontract and on the spot ma
rket, are denominated in U.S. Dollars, although payments are made in Chilean Pesos.21

Other Regulatory Considerations — In 2011, a regulation on air e mission standards for thermoelectric power plants became effective. This regulationprovides for stringent li
mits on emission of PM and gases produced by the combustion of solid and liquid fuels, particularly coal. For existing plants, includingthose currently under const
ruction, the new limits for PM emissions went into effect at the end of 2013, and the new limits for SO 2 , NO x and mercury emissionwill begin to apply in mid-2016, ex
cept for those plants operating in zones declared saturated or latent zones (areas at risk of or affected by excessive air pollution),where these emission lim
its will become effective by June 2015. In order to comply with the new emission standards, AES Gener initiated investments in Chile atits older coal faci
lities (Ventanas I and II and Norgener I and II, constructed between 1964 and 1997) in 2012. As of December 31, 2015, AES Gener has concludedinvestments of approxima
tely $229 million in order to comply within the required time frame. Additionally, its equity method investee Guacolda started theinstallation of new equipm
ent during 2013, spending approximately $185 million (Guacolda I, II and IV) as of December 31, 2015 with the remaining $37 millionto be invested in 2016.
Chilean law requires every 
electricity generator to supply a certain portion of its total contractual obligations with NCREs. In October 2013, the NCRE lawwas amended, increasing the NCRE requi
rements. The law distinguishes between energy contracts executed before and after July 1, 2013. For contracts executedbetween August 31, 2007 and July 1, 2013, the NCRE requirement 
is equal to 5% in 2014 with annual contract increases of 0.5% until reaching 10% in 2024. TheNCRE requirement for contrac
ts executed after July 1, 2013 is equal to 5% in 2013, with annual increases of 1% thereafter until reaching 12% in 2020, andsubsequently annual increas
es of 1.5% until it is equal to 20% in 2025. Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by developing their own NCREgeneration capacity 
(wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and small hydroelectric technology), purchasing NCREs from qualified generators or by paying theapplicable fines for non
-compliance. AES Gener currently fulfills the NCRE requirements by utilizing AES Gener's own biomass power plants and by purchasingNCREs from other generation compan
ies. It has sold certain water rights to companies that are developing small hydro projects, entering into power purchaseagreements with these co
mpanies in order to promote development of these projects, while at the same time meeting the NCRE requirements. At present, AESGener is in the process of negot
iating additional NCRE supply contracts to meet the future requirements.In September 2014 a new tax law was ena
cted. The new law introduces an emission tax, or "green tax", that assesses the emissions of PM, SO 2 , NO x andCO 
2 produced for installations with an installed capacity over 50 MW. The first annual payment shall be made in April 2018, regarding the emissions producedduring year 2017. In the case of CO 
2 , the tax will be equivalent to $5 per ton emitted. In the SING, all  PPAs have "change of law" clauses, which would allow thecompany to transfer this 
cost to customers. In the SIC, costs can only be passed through to unregulated customers, as existing PPAs with discos do not have changeof law clauses. According to its PPAs, the co
mpany is currently discussing the pass-through mechanism with each client. Additionally, new tax laws were enactedin February 2016 in Chile which will inc
rease the statutory income tax rate for most of our Chilean businesses from 25% to 25.5% in 2017 and to 27% for 2018and future years. See Ite
m 7— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financia l Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies andEstimates 
— Income Taxes for further details o f the impacts of these new laws.In June 2015, the Chilean government pub
lished Decree N°7/2015, which allowed energy exportation to Argentina using the transmission line whichconnects the SING (Chilean Northern Grid
) with the SADI (Argentine Grid). The AES transmission line has a capacity of approximately 600MW, but will beoperated at 200 MW accord
ing to technical studies. AES Gener signed an agreement with CAMMESA and other generators (Gas Atacama and ECL) in order toexport electrici
ty to Argentina.Key Financial Drivers 
— Hedge levels at Gener provide some certainty and clarity on the underlying financial drivers through 2016. However, some risksremain through 2016, including, but no
t limited to, the following:•
Dry hydrology scenarios reduce hydro generation (See Item 7.— Key Trends and Uncertainties — Operational — Weather sensitivity for further discussion)
•
Forced outages may impact earnings•
Changes in current regulatory rulings could alter the ability to pass through or recover certain costs•
AES is exposed to the fluctuation of the Chilean peso, which may pose a risk to earnings; our hedging strategy reduces this risk, but some residual risk toearnings remains
•
Tax policy changesBeyond 2016, financial drivers in
clude all of the above factors, but also:•
Current legislation is trending towards promoting renewable energy and strengthening regulations on thermal generation assets, posing a risk to future coalmargins
•
Market price risk when re-contracting22

Construction and Development — Since 2007, AES Gener has constructed and ini tiated commercial operations of approximately 1,830 MW of new capacity,representing a signifi
cant portion of the increase in installed capacity and investment in the SIC and SING during the period. In Chile, AES Gener has a 21 MWsolar project with a schedu
led COD in the first half of 2016 and the 532 MW Cochrane project in the SING, expected to begin operations in 2016. The Cochraneproject has an adjacen
t 20 MW energy storage project, which is also scheduled to initiate operations in 2016.Additionally, in the SIC, AES Gener initia
ted construction of the 531 MW two unit Alto Maipo run-of-river hydroelectric project in December 2013,adjacent to our existing Al
falfal power plant, located 50 km from Santiago. Alto Maipo is the largest project in construction in the SIC market and it includes 67kilometers of tunnel works, 2 c
averns, 17 km of transmission lines as part of the construction, and is 90% underground. Alto Maipo has three main contractors andcovers three adjacen
t valleys in the Chilean Andes. As of today, the project employs 4,100 people and expects to reach a peak close to 4,500 in the second half of2017. The project units are sch
eduled to reach commercial operation in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019.Colombia
Business Description 
— Chivor, a subsidiary of AES Gener, owns a hydroelec tric facility with installed capacity of 1,000 MW, located approximately 160km east of Bogota. As of December 31, 2015, AES Gener's ne
t power production in Colombia was 4,112 GWh. The installed capacity represents approximately6.2% of system capacity as o
f December 31, 2015. The plant consists of eight 125 MW dam-based hydroelectric generating units in two separate sub-facilities. Allof Chivor's installed capac
ity in Colombia is hydroelectric and is therefore dependent on the prevailing hydrological conditions in the region in which it operates.Hydrological conditions larg
ely influence generation and the spot prices at which Chivor sells its non-contracted generation in Colombia.Chivor's commercial str
ategy focuses a significant portion of the expected output under contracts, principally with distribution companies, in order to providecash flow stability. These bi
lateral contracts with distribution companies are awarded in public bids and normally last from one to three years. The remaininggeneration is sold on the spot m
arket to other generation and trading companies at the system marginal cost, allowing us to maximize the operating margin.Additionally, Chivor receives 
reliability payments for the availability and reliability of Chivor's reservoir during periods of scarcity, such as adversehydrological conditions. These p
ayments, referred to as "reliability charge payments" are designed to compensate generation companies for the firm energy thatthey are capable of prov
iding to the system during critical periods of low supply in order to prevent electricity shortages.Market Structure 
— Electricity supply in Colomb ia is concentrated in one main system, the SIN. The SIN encompasses one-third of Colombia's territory,providing coverage to 96% of th
e country's population. The SIN's installed capacity totaled 16,221 MW as of December 31, 2015, comprised of 69.0%hydroelectric generation, 3
0.4% thermoelectric generation and 0.6% other. The dominance of hydroelectric generation and the marked seasonal variations inColombia's hydrology result in pri
ce volatility in the short-term market. In 2015, 68.2% of total energy demand was supplied by hydroelectric plants with theremaining supply from the
rmoelectric generation (31.0%) and cogeneration and self-generation power (0.8%). From 2003 to 2015, electricity demand in the SINhas grown at a compound annual growth ra
te of 3.1% and the UPME projects an average compound annual growth rate in electricity demand of 2.8% per year forthe next ten years.
Regulatory Framework 
— Electricity Regulation — Since 1994, the electric ity sector in Colombia has operated under a competitive market framework forthe generation and sale 
of electricity and a regulated framework for transmission and distribution. The distinct activities of the electricity sector are governed byvarious laws and the regulat
ions and technical standards issued by the CREG. Other government entities that play an important role in the electricity industryinclude the MME, which defines th
e government's policy for the energy sector; the Public Utility Superintendency of Colombia, which is in charge of overseeingand inspecting the utili
ty companies; and the UPME, which is in charge of planning the expansion of the generation and transmission network.The generation sector is o
rganized on a competitive basis with companies selling their generation in the wholesale market at the short-term price or underbilateral contracts with other
 participants, including distribution companies, generators and traders, and unregulated customers at freely negotiated prices.Generation companies must sub
mit price bids and report the quantity of energy available on a daily basis. The National Dispatch Center dispatches generators inmerit order based on bid of
fers in order to ensure that demand will be satisfied by the lowest cost combination of available generating units.Other Regulatory Considerations 
— In the past few years, Colombian authorities have discussed proposals to make certain regulatory changes, which havenot been implemented as o
f December 2015. One proposal is to replace or complement the current public auction system in which each distribution company holdsan auction for its speci
fic requirements and subsequently executes bilateral contracts with generation or trading companies, with a centralized auction in which themarket administra
tor purchases energy for all distribution companies. During 2015, regulators developed rules to implement Law 1715 passed in 2014 regardingthe participation of 
renewables sources in the electric sector and the rules for negotiation of excess of energy from self-generators. Due to very high spot prices inthe market, the regul
ator implemented a temporary "spot price cap"23

equivalent to the 75% of the first step of rationing cost. At the end of 2015, CREG assigned new firm energy obligations for the next 3 years (2017-2019).Additionally, regulation fo
r emergency energy situations, such as severe drought conditions, was introduced in 2014 with the objective of avoiding shortages andother negative economi
c impacts. For 2016, the most probable changes in regulation will relate to the AGC ancillary services market as well as a general revisionof the reliability charge scheme.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Hydrological conditions larg ely influence Chivor's generation level. Maintaining the appropriate contract level, while working tomaximize revenue, th
rough sale of excess generation, is key to Chivor's results of operations (see Item 7.— Key Trends and Uncertainties — Operational — Weather sensitivity 
for further discussion). Hedge levels at Chivor provide certainty and clarity on the underlying financial drivers, hedging the net cash flows ofChivor, up to 90%. However, some risks rema
in beyond 2016. In addition to hydrology, through 2016, financial results are likely to be driven by many factorsincluding, but not limited 
to, the following:•
Forced outages may impact earnings•
AES is exposed to fluctuation of the Colombian peso, which pose a risk to earnings; our hedging strategy reduces this risk, but some residual risk toearnings remains
Beyond 2016, financial drivers in
clude all of the above factors, but also:•
Chivor has exposure to the spot market as hedge levels are lower in the futureConstruction and Development 
— In Colombia, AES Gener is currently constructing the 20 MW Tunjita run-of-river hydroelectric project, which isscheduled to start opera
tions in the first half of 2016.Argentina
Business Description 
— As of December 31, 2015, AES Argentina operates 3,528 M W which represents 10.5% of the country's total installed capacity. Theinstalled capacity 
in the SADI includes the TermoAndes plant, a subsidiary of AES Gener, which is connected both to the SADI and the Chilean SING. AESArgentina has a diver
sified generation portfolio of ten generation facilities, comprised of 62% thermoelectric and 38% hydroelectric capacity. All of thethermoelectric capacity has the capa
bility to burn alternative fuels. Approximately 69% of the thermoelectric capacity can operate alternatively with natural gas ordiesel oil, and the rem
aining 31% can operate alternatively with natural gas, fuel oil, or coal.AES Argentina primarily sells 
its production to the wholesale electric market where prices are largely regulated. In 2015, approximately 93% of the energywas sold in the wholesale elec
tric market and 7% was sold under contract, as a result of the Energy Plus sales made by TermoAndes. Market prices are determinedin Argentine Pesos by CAMMESA, the wholesale elect
ric market administrator.All of the thermoelec
tric facilities not affected by the Resolution 95/2013, a regulation passed in March 2013 discussed below, including the portion ofTermoAndes plant committ
ed to Energy Plus Contracts, are able to use natural gas and receive gas supplied through contracts with Argentine producers. In recentyears, gas supply restrict
ions in Argentina, particularly during the winter season, have affected some of the plants, such as the TermoAndes plant which isconnected to the SING by a transmiss
ion line owned by AES Gener. The TermoAndes plant commenced operations in 2000, selling exclusively into the ChileanSING. In 2008, following requirements fro
m the Argentine authorities, TermoAndes connected its two gas turbines to the SADI, while maintaining its steamturbine connected to the SING. However, sin
ce mid-December 2011, TermoAndes has been selling the plant's full capacity in the SADI. TermoAndes' electricitypermit to export to the SING expi
red on January 31, 2013 and its potential renewal is being evaluated.Market Structure 
— The SADI electricity mark et is managed by CAMMESA. As of December 31, 2015, the installed capacity of the SADI totaled 33,480MW. In 2015, 64% of total energy de
mand was supplied by thermoelectric plants, 31% by hydroelectric plants and 6% from nuclear, wind and solar plants.Thermoelectric gen
eration in the SADI is principally fueled by natural gas. However, since 2004 due to natural gas shortages, in addition to increasingelectricity demand, the use 
of alternative fuels in thermoelectric generation, such as oil and coal, has increased. Given the importance of hydroelectric facilities inthe SADI, hydrological conditions det
ermining river flow volumes and initial water levels in reservoirs largely influence hydroelectric and thermoelectric plantdispatch. Rainfall occurs p
rincipally in the southern cone winter season (June to August).Regulatory Framework 
— Electricity Regulation — The Argentine regulatory f ramework divides the electricity sector into generation, transmission anddistribution. The wholesale e
lectric market is made up of generation companies, transmission companies, distribution companies and large customers who areallowed to buy and sell elec
tricity. Generation companies can sell their output in the short-term market or to customers in the contract market. CAMMESA isresponsible for dispatch coo
rdination and determination of short-term prices. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in charge of regulating24

public service activities and the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, through the Energy Secretariat, regulates system dispatch and grantsconcessions or auth
orizations for sector activities.Since 2001, significant modif
ications have also been made to the electricity regulatory framework. These modifications include tariff conversion toArgentinean Pesos, freezing of 
tariffs, the cancellation of inflation adjustment mechanisms and the introduction of a complex pricing system in the wholesaleelectric market, which have materiall
y affected electricity generators, transporters and distributors, and generated substantial price differences within the market.Since 2004, as a result of energy 
market reforms and overdue accounts receivables owed by the government to generators operating in Argentina, AES Argentinacontributed certain 
accounts receivables to fund the construction of new power plants under FONINVEMEM agreements. These receivables accrue interest and arecollected in monthly ins
tallments over 10 years once the related plants begin operations. At this point, three funds have been created to construct three facilities.The first two plants are ope
rating and payments are being received, while the third plant is in late stages of the construction process. AES Argentina will receive apro rata ownership interes
t in these newly built plants once the accounts receivables have been paid. See Item 7.— Capital Resources and Liquidity—Long-Term Receivables 
and Note 7 —Financing Receivables for further discussion of r eceivables in Argentina.On March 26, 2013, the Secretaria
t of Energy released Resolution 95/2013, which affects the remuneration of generators whose sales prices had been frozensince 2003. This new regulation, which mod
ified the current regulatory framework for the electricity industry, is applicable to generation companies with certainexceptions. It defined a n
ew compensation system based on compensating for fixed costs, non-fuel variable costs and an additional margin. Resolution 95/2013converted the Argentine e
lectric market towards an "average cost" compensation scheme, increasing revenues of generators that were not selling their productionunder the Energy Plus scheme or unde
r energy supply contracts with CAMMESA. Resolution 95/2013 applied to all of AES Argentina's plants, excludingTermoAndes. Based on Note 2053 sent by the Minist
ry of Energy in March 2013, it was understood that TermoAndes' units were not affected by the Resolutionsince they sell under the En
ergy Plus scheme.Thermal units must achi
eve an availability target which varies by technology in order to receive full fixed cost revenues. The availability of most of AESArgentina's units exceeds this 
market average. As a result of Resolution 95/2013, revenues to AES Argentina's thermal units increased, but the impact onhydroelectric units is d
ependent on hydrology. The new Resolution also established that all fuels, except coal, are to be provided by CAMMESA. Thermoelectricnatural gas plants not af
fected by the Resolution, such as TermoAndes, are able to purchase gas directly from the producers for Energy Plus sales.On May 20, 2014, the Argentine government pass
ed Resolution No. 529/214 ("Resolution 529") which retroactively updated the prices of Resolution95/2013 to February 1, 2014, changed targe
t availability and added a remuneration for non-periodic maintenance. This renumeration is aimed to cover the expensesthat the generator in
curs when performing major maintenances in its units.In the fourth quarter of 2014, 
the Argentine government passed a resolution to contribute outstanding Resolution 95 receivables into a trust in connectionwith AES Argentina's commitment to 
install additional capacity into the system. CAMMESA will finance the investment utilizing the outstanding receivables as aguarantee.
On July 10, 2015, the Argentine government pass
ed Resolution No. 482/2015 ("Resolution 482") which retroactively updated the prices of Resolution529/2014 to February 1, 2015, including the por
tion of TermoAndes plant energy generation not committed to Energy Plus Contracts, and created a new trustcalled "Recursos para las 
inversions del FONINVEMEM 2015-2018" in order to invest in new generation plants.In December 2015, the new financ
e minister lifted foreign currency controls, allowing the peso to float under the administration of Argentinean Central Bank.The newly freed currency f
ell by more than 30%. Over the course of 2015, the Argentinean Peso devalued by approximately 50%. At December 31, 2015, alltransactions at our business
es in Argentina were translated using the official exchange rate published by the Argentine Central Bank. See Note 7— Financing Receivables 
in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further in formation on the long-term receivables. Further weakeningof the Argentine Peso and local 
economic activity could cause significant volatility in our results of operations, cash flows, the ability to pay dividends to theParent Company, and the value of our 
assets.Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following:• 
Forced outages may impact earnings• 
FX exposure to fluctuations of the Arg entine Peso• 
Hydrology •
Timely collection of FONINVEMEM installment and outstanding receivables (See Note 7— Financing Receivables in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
for further discussion) •

Brazil Generation Businesses
Business Description 
— Tietê has a portfolio of 12 hyd roelectric power plants with total installed capacity of 2,658 MW in the state of São Paulo. Tietê wasprivatized in 1999 under a 30-y
ear concession expiring in 2029. AES owns a 24% economic interest in Tietê, our partner, the BNDES, owns 28% and theremaining shares are pub
licly held or held by government-related entities. AES is the controlling shareholder and manages and consolidates this business.Tietê sold nearly 100% of i
ts assured capacity, approximately 11,1194 GWh, to Eletropaulo under a long-term PPA, which expired in December 2015. Thecontract was price-ad
justed annually for inflation, and as of December 31, 2015, the price was R$218/MWh. After the expiration of contract with Eletropaulo,Tietê's strategy is to con
tract most of its Assured Energy, as described in Regulatory Framework section below, in the free market and sell the remaining portion inthe spot market. Tietê's s
trategy is reassessed from time to time according to changes in market conditions, hydrology and other factors. Tietê has beencontinuously selling its ava
ilable energy from 2016 forward through medium-term bilateral contracts (3-5 years).As of December 31, 2015, Tietê's contr
acted portfolio position is 95% and 88% with average prices of R$149/MWh and R$150/MWh for 2016 and 2017,respectively. As Brazil is 
mostly a hydro-based country with energy prices highly tied to the hydrological situation, the deterioration of the hydrology since thebeginning of 2014 caused an incre
ase in energy prices going forward. Tietê is closely monitoring and analyzing system supply conditions to support energycommercializa
tion decisions. In 2015, 12 new contracts were signed at an average price of approximately R$154/MWh.Tietê's strategy is to contract most of itsphysical guarantee in th
e free market while the remaining portion provides flexibility to either protect against low hydrology or potentially capture higher spotprices in the future. As Braz
il does not have a developed market with hedge and options instruments for the energy sector, Tietê does not assume any hedgingstrategy for its portfolio.
Under the concession agreem
ent, Tietê has an obligation to increase its capacity by 15%. Tietê as well as other concessionaire generators have not yet metthis requirement due to 
regulatory, environmental, hydrological and fuel constraints. Sao Paulo state does not have a good potential for wind power and also only asmall remaining poten
tial for hydro projects, directing the new increase in the state for thermal capacity. With the high complexity process to get an environmentallicense for coal proj
ects, Tietê decided to fulfill obligation with gas-fired projects in line with Federal government plans. As Petrobras refuses to supply natural gasand to offer capacity 
in its pipelines and regasification terminals and there are no regulations for natural gas swaps in place, up to now, it is unfeasible to bringnatural gas to AES Tietê. A legal 
case has been initiated by the State of São Paulo requiring the investment to be performed. Tietê is in the process of analyzingoptions to meet the obliga
tion.Uruguaiana is a 640 MW gas-fir
ed combined cycle power plant located in the town of Uruguaiana in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, commissioned inDecember 2000. AES manages and has a 46% e
conomic interest in the plant with the remaining interest held by BNDES. The plant's operations were suspended inApril 2009 due to the unavailabi
lity of gas. AES has evaluated several alternatives to bring gas supply on a competitive basis to Uruguaiana. One of the challengesis the
28

capacity restrictions on the Argentinean pipeline, especially during the winter season when gas demand in Argentina is very high. The plant operated on a short-term basis in 2013 during February 
and March, in 2014 during March, April, and May, and in 2015 during February, Mach, April and May due to the short-termsupply of LNG for the facility. Urugua
iana continues to work toward securing gas on a long-term basis.Market Structure 
— Brazil has installed c apacity of 140,272 MW, which is 65% hydroelectric, 21.6% thermal and 13.4% renewable (biomass and wind).Brazil's national grid is d
ivided into four subsystems. Tietê is in the Southeast subsystem of the national grid, while Uruguaiana is in the South.Regulatory Framework 
— In Brazil, the MME determ ines the maximum amount of energy that a plant can sell, called Assured Energy, which represents thelong-term average exp
ected energy production of the plant. Under current rules, a generation plant's Assured Energy can be sold to distribution companies throughlong-term (regulat
ed) auctions or under unregulated bilateral contracts with large consumers or energy trading companies.The ONS is responsible for coordinating 
and controlling the operation of the national grid. The ONS dispatches generators based on hydrological conditions,reservoir levels, el
ectricity demand and the prices of fuel and thermal generation. Given the importance of hydro generation in the country, the ONS sometimesreduces dispatch of h
ydro facilities and increases dispatch of thermal facilities to protect reservoir levels in the system.In Brazil, the system oper
ator controls all hydroelectric generation dispatch and reservoir levels, and a mechanism known as MRE was created to sharehydrological risk across a
ll hydro generators. If the hydro system generates less than total Assured Energy of the system, hydro generators may need to purchaseenergy in the short-ter
m market to fulfill their contract obligations. When total hydro generation is higher than the total MRE Assured Energy, the surplus isproportionally shared among 
its participants and they are able to make extra revenue selling the excess energy on the spot market. The consequences of unfavorablehydrology are (i) therm
al plants (more expensive to the system) being dispatched, (ii) lower hydropower generation with deficits in the MRE and (iii) high spotprices.
Due to lower than expected hydrology du
ring 2014, from February to April the spot price was at the cap of R$822/MWh and the average spot price of 2014was R$689/MWh. During October and November 2014, the ANEEL conduct
ed a public hearing to define a new spot price cap, changing it from R$822/MWh toR$388/MWh from January 2015 until Dece
mber 2015. The lower cap price resulted in a meaningful reduction on the expenses of the agents that were negativelyexposed to the spot price in 2015. However, du
e to improved hydrology in the second half of 2015 spot prices were below the cap with the average price ofR$287/MWh. For 2016, ANEEL has already defined the new spot p
rice cap, changing it from R$388/MWh to R$423/MWh from January 2016 forward.Key Financial Drivers 
— As the system is highly dependent on hydro electric generation, Tietê and Uruguaiana (more likely to generate during lowhydrology) are affect
ed by the hydrology in the overall sector, as well as the availability of Tietê's plants and reliability of the Uruguaiana facility. The availabilityof gas for continued operat
ions is a driver for Uruguaiana.Through and beyond 2016, Tietê's financi
al results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following:•
Hydrology, impacting quantity of energy generated•
Demand growth•
Re-contracting price•
Asset management and plant availability•
Cost management•
Ability to execute on its growth strategyThrough and beyond 2016, Uruguaiana's financi
al results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following:•

Business Description 
— Eletropaulo distribute s electricity to the greater São Paulo area, Brazil's main economic and financial center. Eletropaulo is thelargest electri
c power distributor in Latin America in terms of both revenues and volume of energy distribution.AES owns 16% of the economic interest 
in Eletropaulo, our partner, BNDES, owns 19% and the remaining shares are publicly held or held by government-related entities. AES is th
e controlling shareholder and manages and consolidates this business. Eletropaulo holds a 30-year concession that expires in 2028.29

AES owns 100% of Sul. Sul distributes electricity in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre up to the frontier with Uruguay and Argentina, respectively, inthe municipalities o
f Santana do Livramento and Uruguaiana/São Borja at the extreme west of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. AES manages Sul under a 30-yearconcession expiring in 2027.
Regulatory Framework 
— In Brazil, ANEEL, a government agency, s ets the tariff for each distribution company based on a Return on Asset Basemethodology, which also benchmarks op
erational costs against other distribution companies.The tariff charged to 
regulated customers consists of two elements: (i) pass-through of non-manageable costs under a determined methodology ("Parcel A"),including energy purchase cos
ts, sector charges and transmission and distribution system expenses; and (ii) a manageable cost component ("Parcel B"), includingoperation and maintenan
ce costs (defined by ANEEL), recovery of investments and a component for a return to the distributor. The return to distributors iscalculated as the ne
t asset base multiplied by the Regulatory WACC, which is set for all industry participants during each tariff reset cycle. The current RegulatoryWACC for Eletropaulo, after t
ax, is 8.1%. This WACC is effective for three years and as such will be updated again in the next tariff review for Sul in April 2018.Each year ANEEL reviews each distr
ibutor's tariff for an annual tariff adjustment. The annual tariff adjustments allow for pass-through of Parcel A costs andinflation impacts on Par
cel B costs, adjusted for expected efficiency gains and quality performances. Distribution companies are required to contract between 100%and 105% of anticipated en
ergy needs through the regulated auction market. If contracted levels fall below required levels distribution companies may be subject tolimitations on the pass-
through treatment of energy purchase costs as well as penalties. As the costs incurred on energy purchases by our distribution companies arepassed through to customers with ad
justments on a yearly basis, working capital will be sensitive to significant increases in energy prices. In order to reducepotential working capita
l needs, in February 2015, ANEEL opened two public hearings (i) to discuss an Extraordinary Tariff Review ("ETR") requested bydistribution companies and 
ii) to discuss adjustments to a tariff flag mechanism that may change the tariff to customers on a monthly basis depending on energyprices. These items were 
approved by ANEEL and made effective on March 2, 2015. The ETR represented an average tariff increase of 32% in AES Eletropauloand 39% at AES Sul. The tariff flag 
mechanism, a temporary measure in response to higher energy prices due to dry hydrological conditions, was improved byincorporating i) a highe
r tariff increase depending on the energy purchase costs and (ii) resources collected by the tariff flag being centralized in an account andshared among distribution co
mpanies in proportion to their respective involuntary exposure. Most recently, ANEEL approved the Annual Readjustment for AESSul on April 14, 2015 representing an ave
rage tariff increase of 5.46%.Every four to five years, ANEEL rese
ts each distributor's tariff to incorporate the revised Regulatory WACC and determination of the distributor's net assetbase. Eletropaulo's tari
ff reset occurs every four years and the next tariff reset will be in July 2019. Sul's tariff is reset every five years and the next tariff reset isexpected in April 2018. The 4 
th Tariff Reset for AES Eletropaulo occurred on July 4, 2015, representing an average tariff increase of 15.23%.ANEEL challenged the paramet
ers of a tariff reset for Eletropaulo implemented in July 2012 and retroactive to 2011. ANEEL asserted that during the periodbetween 2007 and 2011, certain asse
ts that were included in the regulatory asset base should not have been included and that Eletropaulo should refund customersfor the return on the disput
ed assets earned during this period. On December 17, 2013, ANEEL determined, at the administrative level, that Eletropaulo shouldadjust the prior (2007-2011) r
egulatory asset base and refund customers in the amount of $269 million (R$630 million) over a period of up to four tariff processesbeginning in July 2014. Eletropaulo f
iled for an administrative appeal requesting ANEEL to reconsider its decision and requested that the decision be suspendeduntil the appeal process was 
completed. On January 28, 2014, ANEEL denied Eletropaulo's request to suspend the effects of the previous decision. On January 29,2014, Eletropaulo requested and 
received from the Federal Court of Brazil an injunction for the suspension of the effects of ANEEL's previous decision. AsANEEL had confirmed the original d
ecision and the related refund to customers, the injunction no longer became effective. The Company recognized a regulatoryliability of approxim
ately $269 million in the Company's 2013 fourth quarter results of operations since ANEEL had compelled the Company to refund customers.Eletropaulo started r
eimbursing customers in July 2014.On December 18, 2014, the effects o
f the injunction were restored and on January 5, 2015, during a public hearing, ANEEL resolved to follow the legaldecision. However, on January 7, 2015 ANEEL requested th
e suspension of the injunction. While the final legal decision has yet not been taken, ANEEL released anew tariff for Eletrop
aulo on January 8, 2015, not considering the reimbursement to customers, which is immediately effective. On June 30, 2015, ANEELincluded in Eletropaulo's t
ariff reset the reimbursement of amounts previously refunded to customers from July 2014 through early January 2015. In addition toANEEL's failure thus far to suspend the 
injunction through the appeals process in the Brazilian courts, the tariff reset resulted in management's reassessment of theprobability of refunding cus
tomers these disputed amounts. The Company now considers it only reasonably possible that Eletropaulo will be required to refundthese amounts to customers p
rior to the ultimate resolution of the pending court case. As a result, during the second quarter of 2015, the Company reversed theremaining regulatory 
liability for this contingency of $161 million. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious arguments on this matter and will continue to pursue itsobjections to ANEEL's rulings vigorously, however 
there can be no assurance that Eletropaulo will prevail.30

Key Financial Drivers — Through and beyond 2016, Eletropaulo's and Sul's fin ancial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but notlimited to, the following:
•
Hydrology, impacting quantity of energy sold and energy purchased•
Brazilian economic growth and tariff increases, impacting energy consumption growth, losses and delinquency (see Item 7.— Key Trends and Uncertainties — 
Macroeconomics—Brazil for further information) •
Ability of both Eletropaulo and Sul to pass through costs via productivity gains•
Capital structure optimization to reduce leverage and interest costs•
Sul's fourth tariff cycle outcomes in April 2018•
July 2012 regulatory asset base resolution•
The Eletrobrás case (see Item 3.— Legal Proceedings for further information) Eletropaulo and Sul are af
fected by the demand for electricity, which is driven by economic activity, weather patterns and customers' consumption behavior.Operating performance 
is also driven by the quality of service, efficient management of operating and maintenance costs as well as the ability to control non-technical losses. Finally, 
annual tariff adjustments and periodic tariff resets by ANEEL impact results from operations.MCAC SBU

Dominican Republic
Business Description 
— AES Dominicana consists of three ope rating subsidiaries, Itabo, Andres and DPP. AES has 23% of the system capacity (850 MW)and supplies approximately 42
% of energy demand through these generation facilities.During 2014, AES entered into a strateg
ic partnership with the Estrella and Linda Groups ("Estrella-Linda"), an investor group based in the DominicanRepublic. Under this agreemen
t, Estrella-Linda acquired an 8% non-controlling interest in AES' business in the Dominican Republic for $83 million and, inDecember 2015, exercised i
ts first call option of additional 2% for$18 million, net of discount and transaction costs. Estrella-Linda has an additional option toincrease up to 20% by the end of 2016. Es
trella-Linda is a consortium of two leading Dominican industrial groups: Estrella and Grupo Linda. The two partnersmanage a diversified bus
iness portfolio, including construction services, cement, agribusiness, metalwork, plastics, textiles, paints, transportation, insurance andmedia.
Itabo is 45%-owned by AES, 5% by Estrella-L
inda, 49.97% owned by FONPER, a government-owned utility and the remaining 0.03% is owned byemployees. Itabo owns and operat
es two thermal power generation units with a total of 295 MW of installed capacity. Itabo's PPAs are with government-owneddistribution companies and 
expire in 2016. Since the majority of distribution companies' long term PPAs are expiring in July 2016, the CDEEE is sponsoring abidding process that is expec
ted to be released and awarded during 2016 in order to secure supply and competitive pricing for actual and future distribution energyrequirements. The exist
ing business strategy is to secure approximately 75% to 85% of the open position through new PPAs with distribution companies and largeusers. Price and PPA structure will be sub
ject to the terms of the bidding process.Andres and DPP are owned 90% by AES and 10% by Estrella-Linda. Andr
es has a combined cycle gas turbine and generation capacity of 319 MW as wellas the only LNG import facili
ty in the country, with 160,000 cubic meters of storage capacity. DPP (Los Mina) has two open cycle natural gas turbines andgeneration capacity o
f 236 MW. Both Andres and DPP have in aggregate 555 MW of installed capacity, of which 450 MW is mostly contracted until 2018 withgovernment-owned distribution 
companies and large customers.AES Dominicana has a long-term LNG purchas
e contract through 2023 for 33.6 trillion btu/year with a price linked to NYMEX Henry Hub. The LNGcontract terms al
low the diversion of the cargoes to various markets in Latin America. These plants capitalize on the competitively-priced LNG contract by sellingpower where the market is dom
inated by fuel oil-based generation.In 2005, Andres entered into a cont
ract to sell re-gasified LNG for further distribution to industrial users within the Dominican Republic using compressiontechnology to transport it wi
thin the country. In January 2010, the first LNG truck33

tanker loading terminal started operations. With this investment, AES is capturing demand from industrial and commercial customers.Market Structure
Electricity Market 
— The Dominican Republic has one ma in interconnected system with approximately 3,742 MW of installed capacity, composed primarilyof thermal generat
ion (82%), hydroelectric power plants (16%) and wind plants (2%).Natural Gas Market 
— The natural gas market in the Dominican Republic started developing in 2001 when AES entered into a long-term contract for LNGand constructed AES Dominicana's LNG regasi
fication terminal.Regulatory Framework 
— The regulatory framework in the Dominican Republic consists of a decentralized industry including generation, transmission anddistribution, where genera
tion companies can earn revenue through short- and long-term PPAs, ancillary services and a competitive wholesale generation market.All electric compan
ies (generators, transmission and distributors), are subject to and regulated by the GEL.Two main agencies are respons
ible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the GEL, the CNE and the SIE. CNE is in charge of drafting andcoordinating the legal 
framework and regulatory legislation, proposing and adopting policies and procedures to assure best practices, drafting plans to ensure theproper functioning and develop
ment of the energy sector and promoting investment. SIE's main responsibilities include monitoring and supervising compliancewith legal provisions and rules, 
monitoring compliance with the technical procedures governing generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization ofelectricity and supervising
 electric market behavior in order to avoid monopolistic practices.The electricity t
ariff applicable to regulated customers is subject to regulation within the concessions of the distribution companies. Clients with demandabove 1.0 MW are classifi
ed as unregulated customers and their tariffs are unregulated.Fuels and hydrocarbons are regul
ated by a specific law which establishes prices to end customers and a tax on consumption of fossil fuels. For natural gasthere are regulat
ions related to the procedures to be followed to grant licenses and concessions: i) distribution, including loading, transportation and compressionplants; ii) the insta
llation and operation of natural gas stations, including consumers and potential modifications of existing facilities; and iii) conversion equipmentsuppliers for vehicles. The 
regulation is administered by the ICM who supervises commercial and industrial activities in the Dominican Republic as well as thefuels and natural gas com
mercialization to the end users.Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following:•
Spot prices are mainly driven by the fluctuations in commodity prices due to the dependency of the Dominican Republic on oil-based thermal generation.Since the fuel component is 
a pass-through cost under the PPAs, any variation in the oil prices will mainly impact the spot sales for both Andres and Itabo,which are expected to be ne
t sellers in the upcoming years. Current contracting level for 2016 is close to 90%. Supply shortages in the near term (next 2 to 3years) may provide opportuni
ties for upside but new generation is expected to come online from 2018.•
Additional sales derived from natural gas domestic demand are expected to continue providing an income stream and growth based on the entry of futureprojects and the fees from
 the infrastructure service.In addition, the financi
al weakness of the three state-owned distribution companies due to low collection rates and high levels of non-technical losses has ledto delays in payments for th
e electricity supplied by generators. At times when outstanding receivable balances have accumulated, AES Dominicana has acceptedpayment through other means, su
ch as government bonds, in order to reduce the balance. There can be no guarantee that alternative collection methodologies willalways be an avenue availab
le for payment options.Construction and Development 
— DPP is converting its existing plant from open cycle to combined cycle. The project will recycle DPP's heat emissions andincrease total power outpu
t by approximately 114 MW of gross capacity at an estimated cost of $260 million, fully financed with non-recourse debt. The EPCcontract was signed on July 2, 2014, and the 
additional capacity is expected to become operational in in the first half of 2017. Based on the increased capacity, AESDominicana executed a PPA for 270 MW fo
r a 6.5 years term beginning on August 1, 2016.Panama
Business Description 
— AES owns and operates five hydroelect ric plants and one thermoelectric power plant, Estrella del Mar I, which commencedoperations in March 2015, repr
esenting 705 MW and 72 MW of hydro and thermal capacity respectively, for a total of 777 MW equivalent to 25% of the installedcapacity in Panama. The m
ajority of hydro sources in Panama are based on run-of-river technology, with the exception of the 260 MW Bayano plant.A portion of the PPAs with distribution compan
ies will expire on December 2018 reducing the total contracted capacity of the company from 496 MW to430 MW. Another portion contract
ed through Estrella del Mar I will expire on June 2020, reducing the total contracted capacity to 350 MW until December 2030.34

Market Structure — Panama's current total installed capacity is 3,068 MW, of which 56% is hydroelectric, 3% wind and the remaining 41% thermalgeneration from diese
l, bunker fuel and coal.The Panamanian power sector is 
composed of three distinct operating business units: generation, distribution and transmission, all of which are governed byElectric Law 6 enacted 
in 1997.Generators can enter in
to long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supply contracts witheach other. Outside of the PPA marke
t, generators may buy and sell energy in the short-term market.The CND implements the economic d
ispatch of electricity in the wholesale market. The CND's objectives are to minimize the total cost of generation andmaintain the reli
ability and security of the electric power system, taking into account the price of water, which determines the dispatch of hydro plants withreservoirs. Short-term powe
r prices are determined on an hourly basis by the last dispatched generating unit.In Panama, dry hydrological cond
itions remained during 2015 affecting the generation output from hydroelectric facilities as in the prior year. AES Panamahad to purchase energy on the spot 
market to fulfill its contract obligations as its generation output was below contract levels. The drop in the commodities priceshelped to reduce the rep
lacement cost and the financial impact of spot purchases compared to the prior year. Despite the hydrology conditions, spot prices weredown to $90/MWh from $217/MWh in 2014, impac
ting also the amount recognized through the 2014-2016 Government Compensation Agreement to only $5.8million out of the $30 mil
lion for 2015. On March 31, 2014, the government of Panama agreed to reduce the financial impact of spot electricity purchases andtransmission constraints 
equivalent to a 70 MW reduction in contracted capacity for the period 2014-2016 by compensating AES Panama for spot purchases up to$40 million in 2014, $30 million in 2015 
and $30 million in 2016.Regulatory Framework 
— The SNE has the responsibilities of p lanning, supervising and controlling policies of the energy sector within Panama. With theseresponsibilities, the SNE proposes l
aws and regulations to the executive agencies that promote the procurement of electrical energy, hydrocarbons and alternativeenergy for the country.
The regulator of public se
rvices, known as the ASEP, is an autonomous agency of the government. ASEP is responsible for the control and oversight ofpublic services including 
electricity and the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities and the companies that provide such services.Generators can only contra
ct their firm capacity. Physical generation of energy is determined by the CND regardless of contractual arrangements.Key Financial Drivers 
— Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to, the following:•
Lower hydrology resulting in low generation and additional energy purchases to fulfill contracts, partially mitigated by additional generation from Estrelladel Mar I, lower spot prices d
riven by the drop in commodities, and the compensation amount from the Government Compensation Agreement.•
In addition to spot prices being driven by hydrology since Panama is highly dependent on hydro generation (~56%), the fluctuations in commodity prices,mainly oil prices, af
fect the thermal generation cost impacting the spot prices and the opportunity cost of water. In the event of low hydrology, highcommodity prices will in
crease the business exposure and the cost of replacement power to back up our contractual commitment. •
Constraints imposed by the capacity of the transmission line connecting the west side of the country with the load center are expected to continue until theend of 2016 keeping surplus power trapped, p
articularly during the wet season.•
Country demand as GDP growth is expected to remain strong over the short and medium term.Given that most of AES' portfolio is run
-of-river, hydrological conditions have an important influence on its profitability. Variations in actual hydrology canresult in excess or a short 
energy balance relative to our contract obligations. During the low inflow period (January to May), generation tends to be lower and AESPanama may purchase energy 
in the short-term market to cover contractual obligations. During the remainder of the year (June to December), generation tends tobe higher and energy genera
ted in excess of contract volumes is sold to the short-term market. In addition to hydrological conditions, commodity prices affectshort-term electricity prices. See
 Item 7.— Key Trends and Uncertainties — Operational — Sensitivity to Dry Hydrological Conditions for further information. Construction and Development 
— Continuing with the strategy to r educe reliance on hydrology started with the acquisition of the power barge, Estrella delMar I, in August 2015 AES executed a partne
rship agreement with Deeplight Corporation, a minority partner, with the purpose to construct, operate and maintain anatural gas power generat
ion plant and a liquefied natural gas terminal, in order to purchase and sell energy and capacity as well as commercialize natural gas andother ancillary ac
tivities related to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, amounts capitalized include $7 million recorded in Construction in Progress and theproject is scheduled to in
itiate operations in the first half of 2018.35

located in San Luis Potosi, supply power to their offtakers under long-term PPAs expiring in 2027 with a 90%availability guaran
tee. TEG and TEP secure their fuel under a long-term contract.Merida is a CCGT, located in Merid
a, on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Merida sells power to the CFE under a capacity and energy based long-term PPAthrough 2025. Additionally, the plant pu
rchases natural gas and diesel fuel under a long-term contract, the cost of which is then passed through to CFE under theterms of the PPA.
In line with AES' strategy of building s
trategic partnerships, on January 18, 2016 the 50/50 Joint Venture partnership agreement with Grupo BAL was fullyexecuted. The Joint Venture wil
l co-invest in power and related infrastructure projects in Mexico.Market Structure 
— Mexico has a single nationa l electricity grid, the SEN, covering nearly all of Mexico's territory. Mexico has an installed capacity totaling65 GW with a generation mix of 74% 
thermal, 19% hydroelectric and 7% other. Electricity consumption is split between the following end users: industrial (58%),residential (26%) and commercial a
nd service (16%).Regulatory Framework 
— Following the constitutional changes approved in December 2013, during 2014 and 2015 the Mexican government issued apackage of secondary regul
ations, including the Electricity Law, and operational dispositions, with the objective to start the implementation of a new regulatoryframework which foresees:
•
The energy market liberalization in January 2016 through the implementation of: wholesale electricity market (day ahead and real time market), ancillaryservices, capacity, Cle
an Energy Certificates, and Financial Transmission Rights market.•
CFE's, former state-owned electric monopoly, vertical and horizontal disintegration into different segments of the value chain: generation, transmission,distribution and commer
cialization.•
CENACE as new ISO is responsible for managing the wholesale electricity market, transmission and distribution infrastructure, planning the networkdevelopments, guarantee
ing open access to network infrastructure, executing competitive mechanisms to cover regulated demand, and setting transmissioncharges.
•
Implementation of annual mid and long term auctions to secure supply for the regulated demand, establishing a PPA with CFE as the Basic Supplier.According to the new regulatory 
framework, new assets developed under the new framework or assets transferred to the new regime and in operation afterthe approval of the Elec
tricity Law (August 2014) are eligible to participate in the new markets. Additionally, projects developed and operated under the ElectricPublic Service Law (self-supply 
framework) like TEG TEP, could choose to participate. Until the new framework is further analyzed, AES will continue operatingunder the same conditions. Me
rida III and TEG/TEP will continue providing power under long-term contracts and selling any excess or surplus energy produced toCFE.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Operational performan ce is the key business driver as the companies are fully contracted and better performance providesadditional financia
l benefits including performance incentives and/or excess energy sales (in the case of TEG/TEP). The energy prices of TEG/TEP for the sales inexcess over its long-ter
m contracts are driven by the average production cost of CFE which is highly dependent on natural gas and oil. If the average productioncost of CFE is higher than the cost of g
enerating with pet coke, our businesses in Mexico will benefit provided that they are able to sell energy in excess of theirPPAs.

Puerto Rico
Business Description 
— AES Puerto Rico owns and operates a coal-f ired cogeneration plant and a recently acquired solar plant of 524 MW and 24 MW,respectively, repres
enting approximately 9% of the installed capacity in Puerto Rico. Both plants have long-term PPAs expiring in 2027 and 2032, respectively,with PREPA, a state-owned entity that suppli
es virtually all of the electric power consumed in Puerto Rico and generates, transmits and distributes electricity to1.4 million customers. On April 29, 2015, AES compl
eted the acquisition of 100% of the common stock of the solar plant, AES Illumina. Its results of operationshave been included in AES' consolidat
ed results of operations from the date of acquisition. See Item 7.— Key Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic and Political—Puerto Rico

El SalvadorBusiness Description 
— AES is the majority owner of four of the five distribution companies operating in El Salvador. The distribution companies areoperated by AES on an integrated bas
is under a single management team. AES El Salvador's territory covers 77% of the country. AES El Salvador accounted for3,730 GWh of market energy purchas
es during 2015, or about 64% market share of the country's total energy purchases.AES El Salvador also owns AES Nejapa, a 6 MW power plant gene
rating electricity with methane gas from a landfill, fully contracted with CAESS. During2015, AES El Salvador began operations of a AES Moncagua, 
a 2.5 MW solar facility located in the east of the country, which is fully contracted with EEO.The sector is governed by the Gene
ral Electricity Law and the general and specific orders are issued by Superintendencia General de Electricidad yTelecomunicacions ("SIGET" or "The Regu
lator"). The Regulator, jointly with the distribution companies in El Salvador, completed the tariff reset process inDecember 2012 and defined the 
tariff calculation to be applicable for the next five years (2013-2017).Europe SBU

Europe Businesses
Bulgaria
Business Description 
— Our Maritza plant is a 690 MW lignite fuel plant that was commissioned in June 2011. Maritza is fully compliant with the EUIndustrial Emission Direc
tive, which came into force in January 2016. Maritza's entire power output is contracted with NEK under a 15-year PPA expiring in 2026,capacity and energy based, wi
th a fuel pass-though. The lignite and limestone are supplied under a 15-year fuel supply contract.38

AES also owns an 89% economic interest in the St. Nikola wind farm with 156 MW of installed capacity. St. Nikola was commissioned in March 2010. Itsentire power output is contr
acted with NEK under a 15-year PPA expiring in March 2025.Market Structure 
— The maximum market c apacity in 201 5 was approximately 13.6 GW. Thermal generation, which is mostly coal-fired, and nuclearpower plants account for 64% of 
the installed capacity.Regulatory Framework 
— The electricity sector in Bulgaria operates under the Energy Act of 2004 that allows the sale of electricity to take place freely atnegotiated prices, at 
regulated prices between parties or on the organized market. In 2015 the government of Bulgaria has made advances toward marketliberalization and h
as engaged with the World Bank to develop a model for a fully liberalized electricity market in Bulgaria. The final report with recommendationsfrom the World Bank is expec
ted in May 2016. The Independent Bulgarian Energy Exchange started commercial operation of the power exchange on January 19,2016 after successful tes
t sessions were held in December 2015.Our investments in Bulgaria r
ely on long-term PPAs with NEK, the state-owned electricity public supplier and energy trading company. NEK is facing someliquidity issues and has been de
layed in making payments under the PPAs with Maritza and St. Nikola. In May and June 2014, SEWRC issued decisionsprecluding the ability o
f NEK to pass-through to the regulated market certain costs incurred by NEK pursuant to the PPA with Maritza, which impacted NEK'sliquidity and its abili
ty to make payments under the PPA. SEWRC also instructed NEK and Maritza to begin negotiating amendments to the PPA. Maritza hasengaged in negotiations with NEK and othe
r Bulgarian state bodies concerning these matters. In August 2015, the ninth amendment of Maritza's PPA was executedunder which Maritza and NEK would reduce 
the capacity payment to Maritza under the PPA by 14% through the PPA Term, without impacting the energy pricecomponent. In exchange, NEK would pay Marit
za its overdue receivables. The amendment will become effective upon full payment of the overdue receivables byNEK, which is expected in 2016. In 2014 SEWRC announced that i
t has asked the DG Comp to review NEK's respective PPAs with Maritza and a separategenerator pursuant to Europe
an state aid rules, and to suspend the PPAs pending the completion of that review. DG Comp has not contacted Maritza about theSEWRC's request to date.
In March 2015, changes to the Energy Ac
t were enacted. Changes included a limitation on electricity purchases from co-generators at preferential prices, theallocation of the proc
eeds from the sale of state CO 2 allowances to NEK, and an increase in the Regulator's independence through appointment of its members bythe Parliament rath
er than by the Council of Ministers. In July 2015, additional measures were voted by the Parliament to complement the first measures taken inMarch 2015. An Electricity Secu
rity Fund was created to help NEK meet its obligations with energy producers, financed with a 5% contribution from all energyproducers on their energy r
evenues as well as with proceeds from the sale of state CO 2 allowances. Maritza is able to pass-through this additional contribution toNEK since it falls under a chang
e in law provision under the PPA. Following the Energy Act amendments on July 31, 2015 the regulator approved new regulatedprices that led to 0.11% de
crease for household electricity prices and increased the non-household prices between 0% and 20% for the various segments. OnNovember 1, 2015 the regulator de
creased the non-household prices 2.5% on average as result of the falling gas prices. All these actions are expected to improveNEK's liquidity. At this time, it is d
ifficult to predict the impact of the political conditions and regulatory changes on our businesses in Bulgaria.Maritza has experien
ced ongoing delays in the collection of outstanding receivables from NEK. As of December 31, 2015 , Maritza had an outstanding receivables balanc
e of $351 million including $44 million of current receivables, $82 million of receivables overdue by less than 90 days and $225 million ofreceivables overdue by mo
re than 90 days. See Key Trends and Uncertainties — Macroeconomics and Political — Bulgaria in Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis 
to this Form 10-K for further in formation.NEK has failed to maintain a 
minimum rating pursuant to the Government Support Letter issued in 2005. As a result, the PPA could be terminated at thediscretion of Maritz
a and the lenders. See Item 1A.— Risk Factors — We may not be able to enter into long-term contracts, which reduce volatility in our resultsof operations 
. As a result of any of the forego ing events, we may face a loss of earnings and/or cash flows from the affected businesses (or be unable to exerciseremedies for a brea
ch of the PPA) and may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their valueand/or face the possibil
ity that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a materialimpact on the Company.
Key Financial Drivers 
— Both businesses, Maritza and St. Nikola, operate under PPA contracts. For the duration of the PPA, the financial results areprimarily driven by, but not 
limited to: the availability of the operating units; the level of wind resource for St. Nikola; and NEK's ability to meet the terms of thePPA contract.
United Kingdom
Business Description 
— AES' generation businesses in the United Kingdo m operate in the Irish Single Electricity Market (SEM) for the businesses located inNorthern Ireland (1,918 MW). During 2015, AES sold i
ts interests in wind development pipelines of 115 MW in Scotland.39

The Northern Ireland generation facilities consist of two plants within the Greater Belfast region. Our Kilroot plant is a 662 MW coal-fired plant with 10MW of energy storage fac
ility and our Ballylumford plant is a 1,246 MW gas-fired plant. These plants provide approximately 70% of the Northern Ireland installedcapacity and 18% of the
 combined installed capacity for the island of Ireland.Kilroot is a merchant pl
ant that bids into the SEM market. Kilroot derives its value from the variable margin when scheduled in merit and the margin fromconstrained dispatch (when disp
atched out of merit to support the system in relation to the wind generation, voltage and transmission constraints) and capacitypayments paid through the SEM Capaci
ty Payment Mechanism. In addition to the above, value is also secured from ancillary services.Ballylumford is partia
lly contracted for 600 MW under a PPA with PPB that expires in 2018, with an extension at the offtaker's option through 2023, withthe remaining capac
ity bid into the SEM market. Ballylumford's key sources of revenue are availability payments received under the PPA and capacity paymentsoffered through the SEM Capacity Pay
ment Mechanism. Additionally, Ballylumford receives revenue from constrained dispatch through which the costs ofoperation are recovered from t
he market and also from the ancillary services market.Market Structure 
— The majority of the gene ration capacity in the SEM is represented by gas-fired power plants, which results in market sensitivity to gasprices. Wind generation 
capacity represents approximately 18% of the total generation capacity. The governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Irelandplan further increases in re
newables. Market availability and liquidity of hedging products are weak, reflecting the limited size and immaturity of the market, thepredominance of vertical integrati
on and lack of forward pricing. There are essentially three products (baseload, mid-merit and peaking) which are traded betweenthe generators and supplie
rs.Regulatory Framework 
— Electricity Regulation — The SEM is an energy market est ablished in 2007 and is based on a gross mandatory pool within whichall generators with a c
apacity higher than 10 MW must trade the physical delivery of power. Generators are centrally dispatched based on merit order and physicalconstraints of the system.
In addition, there is a
 capacity payment mechanism to ensure that sufficient generating capacity is offered to the market. The capacity payment is derivedfrom a regulated Euro-b
ased capacity payment pool, established a year ahead by the regulatory authority. Capacity payments are based on the declared availabilityof a unit and have a
 degree of volatility to reflect seasonal influences, demand and the actual out-turn of generation declared available over each trading period.Environmental Regulation 
— The European Commission adopted in 2011 th e Industrial Emissions Directive ("IED") that establishes the Emission LimitValues ("ELV") for SO 
2 , NO x and dust emissions to be complied with starting from January 1, 2016. Both Ballylumford and Kilroot are required to comply withthe IED. The Ballylumford C Station is 
compliant without the need for investment. Both Ballylumford B Station and Kilroot required investment to be incompliance.
The IED provides for two options that m
ay be implemented by the EU member states other than compliance with the new ELV's- the Transitional NationalPlan ("TNP") or Limited Life Tim
e Derogation ("LLTD").Kilroot has opted into the TNP and this a
llows the plant to operate between 2016-2020, being exempt from compliance with ELVs, but observing a ceilingset for maximum annual 
emissions that is based on the last 10 years average emissions and operating hours. Kilroot has invested approximately $10 million inUmbrella Selective Non Cata
lytic Reduction ("USNCR") technology, which reduces the plant's NO x emissions enabling the plant to increase its capacity factorwithin the ceiling of NO 
x emissions and earn energy margin. Further technical modifications are being evaluated which could make the plant fully compliant withIED from 2020.
Without investment, the Ba
llylumford B station of 540 MW would not meet the standards of the IED following 2015. In 2014, AES competed to secure aLocal Reserve Services Agree
ment ("LRSA") with the Transmission System Operator ("TSO") to refurbish two of the three units to be compliant with ELVs underIED, providing at least 250 MW of c
apacity from 2016 to 2018 with an option to extend to 2020 by the TSO. These units will also qualify for capacity paymentsunder the SEM.
Key Financial Drivers 
— For our businesses in the SEM market, th e financial results will be driven by, but not limited to, the following, and may change in2017 due to regulatory changes to 
the market structure and payment mechanism:•
Availability of the operating units•
Commodity prices (gas, coal and CO 2 ) and sufficient market liquidity to hedge prices in the short-term•
Electricity demand in the SEMKazakhstan
Business Description 
— Our businesses account for approxi mately 6% of the total annual generation in Kazakhstan. Of the total capacity of 2,750 MW,1,033 MW is hydroelectric and op
erates under a concession agreement until the beginning of October 2017 and 1,717 MW of coal-fired capacity is owned outright.The thermal plants ar
e designed to produce heat with electricity as a co- or by-product.40

The Kazakhstan businesses act as merchant plants for electricity sales by entering into bilateral contracts directly with consumers for periods of generally nomore than one year. There 
are no opportunities for the plants to be in contracted status, as there is no central offtaker, and the few businesses that could take awhole plant's generation tend 
to have in-house generation capacity. The 2015 amendments to the Electricity Law state that a centrally organized capacity marketwill be established by 2019, but the 
capacity offtaker still only signs annual contracts.The hydroelectric plants are
 run-of-river and rely on river flow and precipitation, particularly snow. Due to the presence of a large multi-year storage damupstream and a growing season min
imum river flow rate agreement with Russia downstream, the plants are protected against significant downside risk to theirvolume in years with low precip
itation. AES does not control water flow which impacts our generation.Ust Kamenogorsk CHP provides heat to the city o
f Ust Kamenogorsk through the city heat network company (Ust Kamenogorsk Heat Nets). UstKamenogorsk CHP is their only source of supply.
Market Structure 
— The Kazakhstan electri city market totals approximately 20,657 MW, of which 17,421 MW is available. The bulk of the generatingcapacity in Kazakhstan is 
thermal with coal as the main fuel. As coal is abundantly available in Kazakhstan, most plants are designed to burn local coal. Thegeographical remoten
ess of Kazakhstan, in combination with its abundant resources, results in coal prices that are not reflective of world coal prices, currentdelivered cost is less th
an $18 per metric ton. In addition, the government closely monitors coal prices, due to their impact on the price of socially necessaryheating and on electri
city tariffs.Regulatory Framework 
— All Kazakhstan generating companies sell electricity at or below their respective tariff-cap level. These tariff-cap levels have beenfixed by the Kazakhstan governm
ent for the period 2009-2018 for each of the fifteen groups of generators. These groups were determined by the Ministry ofEnergy, previously Ministry of Indus
try and New Technologies, based on a number of factors including plant type and fuel used.In July 2012, Kazakhstan enacted va
rious amendments to its Electricity Law. Among the amendments was a requirement to reinvest all profits generated byelectricity produc
ers during the years 2013-2015. Accordingly, the business will be unable to pay dividends for the period 2013-2015. Under the amendedElectricity Law, ele
ctricity producers must, on an annual basis, enter into Investment Obligation Agreements ("IOAs") with the Ministry of Energy. These annualIOAs must equal the sum of the upcom
ing year's planned depreciation and profit. Selection of investment projects for the IOAs is at the discretion of electricityproducers, but the Ministry of En
ergy has the right to reject submitted IOA proposals. An electricity producer without an IOA executed by the Ministry of Energymay not charge tarif
fs exceeding its incremental cost of production, excluding depreciation. In December 2014, the Ministry of Energy executed IOAs with all fourAES generators in Kazakhstan, which al
low revenue at the tariff-cap level, but all generated cash will need to be reinvested.In November 2015, Kazakhstan enact
ed amendments to its Electricity Law to extend price cap regulation till the end of2018 and postpone the introduction of 
capacity market till 2019. In addition, the obligation for power plants to sign annual IOAs has been eliminated for 2016-2018. During 2013-2015, IOAs required businesses to re
invest the sum of all profits and depreciation on an annual basis, limiting the ability to send dividends.Beginning in 2016 Kazakhstan no longer has a 
restriction on sending dividends.Heat production in Kazakhstan is 
also regulated as a natural monopoly. The heat tariffs are set on a cost-plus basis by making an application to the Regulator(Committee of Natural Monopo
ly Regulation and Competition Protection). Currently, tariffs are only for multi-year periods, but with some annual adjustments forfuel cost.
Key Financial Drivers 
— The financial results for assets in Kazakhstan are driven by many factors including, but not limited to: availability of the operatingunits; regulated electricity tariff-cap le
vels; regulated heat tariff levels; and weather conditions, but may change in 2016 due to regulatory changes to the marketstructure and payment m
echanism.•

Business Description 
— OPGC is a 420 MW coal-fired generat ion facility located in the state of Odisha. OPGC has a 30-year PPA with GRIDCO Limited, astate utility, expir
ing in 2026. The PPA is composed of a capacity payment based on fixed parameters and a variable component, including a pass-through of actualfuel costs. OPGC is an unconsolidated enti
ty and results are reported as Equity in Earnings of Affiliates in our consolidated results of operations.Construction and Development 
— As noted above, AES has one coal-fired pro ject under development with a total capacity of 1,320 MW which is anexpansion of our existing OPGC business. The projec
t started construction in April 2014 and is currently expected to begin operations in 2018. As of December 31,2015 
, total capitalized costs at t he project level were $336 million (AES share of $165 million), while a t the AES level capitalized costs were $13.6 million.Currently, 50% of the expansion c
apacity is contracted with the state offtaker, GRIDCO, for a period of 25 years, with a normative after-tax rate of return of 15.5%with an opportunity to capture 
additional 0.5% tied to timely completion of the project. The contract is subject to Central Electricity Regulatory Commission("CERC") approval, which is responsible for pub
lishing tariff determination norms every five years. The rest of the capacity is expected to be sold throughcompetitive bid or regu
lated Power Purchase Agreements and a small component in the Indian merchant market.In August 2014, the Supreme Court of India inv
alidated the allocation of captive coal blocks. The government of India has subsequently enacted new lawsallowing coal block alloc
ation to companies with limited levels of private ownership, based on which the coal blocks have been allocated to a subsidiary of OPGC,Odisha Coal and Power Ltd. ("OCPL"), which is an OPGC joint venture with anoth
er company wholly-owned by the government of Odisha. This new companymeets the lower privat
e ownership stipulations for allocation of mines.Environmental Regulation 
— The Ministry of Environment Fores t and Climate Change in India has recently amended the Environment (Protection) Ruleswith stricter emission 
limits for new as well as existing thermal power plants via their notification dated December 7, 2015. All existing plants installed beforeDecember 31, 2003 are requir
ed to meet revised emission limits within two years and any new thermal power plants that will be operational from January 1, 2017are required to opera
te with the revised emission limits. An FGD system needs to be installed in the existing units of OPGC for complying with SO 2 emissionsrequirements. The business is 
evaluating the options and the cost implications. The required design modification and scheduled implications for the expansionproject are curren
tly being evaluated. The impacts of these amendments are still under review, but we believe the cost of complying with the new environmentalregulations will be a pass-
through in the GRIDCO tariff for both existing and expansion units. Ministry of Power has issued revised Tariff Policy in January 2016to bring more regulatory
 certainty, attract private investment, ensure distribution efficiency and promote renewable energy.Philippines
Business Description 
— The Masinloc power project in the Philippines is a 630 (gross) MW coal-fired plant located in Zambales, Philippines and isinterconnected to the Lu
zon Grid. AES acquired 92% of Masinloc in 2008 (IFC is an 8% non-controlling shareholder in Masinloc). In July 2014, AES reduced itsownership to 51% through a sale to th
e EGCO Group, a Thailand-based power company. More than 95% of Masinloc's peak capacity and variable margin arecontracted through
43

medium to long-term bilateral contracts primarily with Meralco, the largest distribution company in the Philippines, several electric cooperatives and industrialcustomers.
In January 2013, Masinloc enter
ed into a new Power Supply Agreement ("PSA") with its main customer, Meralco, as the previous Transition Supply Contract("TSA") expired in December 2012. The PSA is for 7 ye
ars, with an additional 3-year extension clause dependent on mutual agreement. Payments are primarilycapacity-based. The PSA is prima
rily priced in U.S. Dollars, aligning the revenues with the majority of variable and fixed costs (fuel, debt, insurance) andminimizing currency 
exchange risks. Masinloc's remaining contracts expire between 2016 and 2026.Construction and Development 
— In December 2015, financia l close was achieved for 335 MW (gross) expansion unit adjacent to the existing 630 MWplant. The project, which will 
employ supercritical technology is expected to be commercially operating in 2019. The additional capacity is targeted for sale todistribution utiliti
es, electric cooperatives, and industrial and commercial customers in the Luzon and Visayas grids. 40% of this additional capacity has alreadybeen contracted with an
 expectation to have 80% capacity contracted by the date of commercial operations.Market Structure 
— The Philippine power market is d ivided into three grids representing the country's three major island groups — Luzon, Visayas andMindanao. Luzon (which includes Mani
la and is the country's largest island) has limited interconnection with Visayas and represents 85% of the total demand ofboth regions. Luzon and Visayas togethe
r have an installed capacity of 16,093 MW.There is diversity in the 
mix of the Luzon — Visayas generation, with coal accounting for 37%, natural gas for 17%, hydroelectric for 15%, geothermalgeneration for 10%, and the 
remaining 21% from other generating plants such as oil, wind, biomass, and solar (priority dispatch with feed-in tariff).The primary customers for
 electricity are private distribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and large contestable (industrial and commercial)customers. Approximately 90%
-94% of the system's total energy requirement is currently being sold/purchased through medium (3-5 years) to long (6-10 years)term bilateral 
contracts. The remaining 6%-10% of energy is sold through the WESM, which is the real-time, bid-based and hourly market for energy where thesellers and the buyers adjus
t their differences between their production/demand and their contractual commitments.Environmental Regulation 
— The Renewable Energy Act of 2008 was enact ed to promote the development, utilization and commercialization of renewableenergy resources, such as sola
r, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energies. Under Chapter III, Section 6, the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) wasintroduced mandating al
l stakeholders in the electric power industry to contribute to the growth of the renewable energy industry of the country. Under the currentdraft of the RPS, certain custo
mers (e.g. distribution utilities and retail electricity suppliers) will be required to source a certain percentage of their supply fromeligible renewable en
ergy sources. The National Renewable Energy Board ("NREB") is currently developing and implementing regulations for the RPS, includingmechanisms for compliance b
y actual purchase of renewable energy or equivalent renewable energy certificates. If the regulations are implemented, our RetailElectricity Supply business in 
the Philippines could be affected by the RPS requirement.Regulatory Framework
Electricity Regulation 
— The Philippines has divided its power s ector into generation, transmission, distribution and supply under the EPIRA act. TheEPIRA primarily aims to incr
ease private sector participation in the power sector and to privatize the Philippine government's generation and transmission assets.Generation and supply are open and 
competitive sectors, while transmission and distribution are regulated sectors. Sale of power is conducted primarily throughmedium or long-term bi
lateral contracts between generation companies and distribution utilities specifying the volume, price and conditions for the sale of energyand capacity, which are app
roved by the ERC. Power is traded in the WESM which operates under a gross pool, central dispatch and net settlement protocols.Parties to bilatera
l contracts settle their transactions outside of the WESM and distribution companies or electricity cooperatives buy their imbalance (i.e., powerrequirements not cover
ed by bilateral contracts) from the WESM. Distribution utilities and electric cooperatives are allowed to pass on to their end-users thebilateral contra
ct rates, including WESM purchases, approved by the ERC.Other Regulatory Considerations 
— Pursuant to EPIRA, RCOA commenced on June 26, 2013, under which retai l electricity suppliers, who are duly licensedby the ERC, may supply directly to cont
estable customers (end-users with an average demand of at least 1 MW), with distribution companies or electricitycooperatives providing non-dis
criminatory wire services. Bilateral contracts with contestable customers do not require ERC approval to be implemented. Masinlochas obtained a retail 
electricity supplier license from the ERC and currently markets power to contestable customers. On June 16, 2015, ERC released a draft forthe rules on mandatory cont
estability. According to this draft, all contestable customers with an average peak demand of more 750 kW are mandated to enter intopower supply contracts by June 2016, at which po
int contestable customers shall be required to purchase power from licensed generation or retail suppliers insteadof their local distr
ibution utility.44

VietnamBusiness Description 
— The Mong Duong II power project is a 1,240 MW gross coal-fired plant located in Quang Ninh Province of Vietnam and wasconstructed under a BOT contrac
t (the project will be transferred to Vietnamese government after 25 years). AES-VCM Mong Duong Power Company Limited("the BOT Company") is a limited l
iability joint venture owned by affiliates of AES (51%), Posco Energy Corporation (30%) and China Investment Corporation(19%). This is the first and 
largest coal-fired BOT project using pulverized coal fired boiler technology in Vietnam. The BOT Company has entered a PPA withEVN, the national utility, and a Coa
l Supply Agreement ("CSA") with Vinacomin, a state owned entity, both with a 25 year term starting from CommercialOperation Date.
Since April 22, 2015, both units of the Power Faci
lity have been in commercial operations, six months earlier than the committed schedule with theVietnamese government. The BOT Company m
akes available the dependable capacity and delivers electrical energy to EVN and, in return, EVN makes paymentsto the BOT Company.
Market Structure 
— The Vietnam Power market is div ided into three regions (North, Central and South), with current total installed capacity of 37,604 MW,an 11% increase from 2014 (33,970 M
W). The total demand in year 2015 was 141.8 billion kWh with the highest demand of 70 billion kWh in the South and 60billion kWh in the North.
The fuel mix in Vietnam is 
comprised of hydropower 35% (priority dispatch with low tariff), coal 35%, gas 20%, diesel and small hydro generation 5%, oil1% (dispatched during eme
rgencies or during peak demand), thermo-gas 1% and the remaining 3% imported from China and Lao. The government has a plan toincrease thermal powe
r capacity, primarily with coal, to reduce the dependence on hydroelectricity. According to the Master Plan VII, the total targeted installedcapacity for 2020 is approxi
mately 75,000 MW, in which coal-fired power will account for 48%, hydropower 23%, pumped storage hydropower 2%, gas-firedthermo-power 17%, renewable 
energy 6%, nuclear power 1% and imported power 3%.EVN owns 58% of installed generation c
apacity followed by Petro Vietnam ("PVN") 12%, Vinacomin 4%, BOT projects 8% and others 18%. EVN is astate-owned company that is so
lely in charge of buying and selling electricity all over Vietnam. The government is planning to decrease EVN's ownership andincrease private sector participatio
n in the power market.Regulatory Framework
Electricity Regulation 
— The electricity se ctor is overseen by several key government entities, including the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, theMinistry of Industry & Trade 
("MOIT") and the Electricity Regulatory Agency of Vietnam ("ERAV"), which is under the supervision of the MOIT. These entitiesare responsible for the 
issuance of laws, guidance, and implementing regulations for the sector. The MOIT, in particular, is responsible for formulating a programto restructure the power
 industry, develop the electricity market and promulgating electricity market regulations.Generation, transmission and d
istribution are currently dominated by the EVN, despite recent inclusion of other players. Transmission and distributioncompanies are wholly-owned by EVN and it a
lso owns 58% of the total installed capacity as noted above. The fuel supply is owned by the government throughVinacomin and PVN. The government plans to equ
itize EVN-owned generation companies and separate generation, System and Market Provider ("SMP") anddistribution into three d
ifferent independent operations in order to establish the competitive power market.Other Regulatory Considerations 
— According to Decision 63/2013/QÐ-TTG dated Novembe r 8, 2013, the roadmap of the power market of Vietnamconsists of three phases. The f
irst phase in relation to establishment of a competitive electricity market was finished at the end of 2014. The second phase: (i)period of 2015-20
16 for establishment of a pilot competitive wholesale electricity market; and (ii) period of 2017-2021 for implementation of a competitivewholesale electricity market. T
he third phase: (i) period of 2022-2023 for establishment of a pilot competitive retail electricity market; and (ii) from 2013 onwardfor implementation o
f competitive retail electricity market. EVN as a long standing monopoly in the whole chain of generation, transmission and distribution, isbeing restructured to a
llow spin-off of several subsidiaries into either independent state-owned enterprises or joint stock companies. The BOT power plants will notparticipate in the powe
r market; alternatively the single buyer will bid the tariff on the power pool on their behalf.Environmental Regulation 
— Mong Duong II BOT Power Plant complies strictly wi th environmental requirements involving local regulations and IFCEnvironmental, Health and Saf
ety Guidelines for Thermal Power Plants.The revised Environmental Ac
t was enacted, effective from January 1, 2015 establishing new rules in relation to, discarded materials and hazardous wastemanagement. Additionally, n
ew regulations on the registration of effluent and emission waste will be put into effect from the beginning of 2018 with no materialimpact to AES.
According to Decision No. 1696/QÐ-TTG dated Septembe
r 23, 2014 on re-using of ash and gypsum discharged from coal power plants for constructionmaterial, the power pl
ants need to propose investment and construction plans (or co-operative investment) to convert ash into construction material before 2020.There is no material 
impact to AES.45

Sri LankaBusiness Description 
— AES closed the sale of Kelanitiss a, a 168 MW oil-fired business with 90% ownership, on January 27, 2016 with proceeds of $18million, with the potenti
al to receive up to an additional $1.3 million overdue receivable from CEB.Financial Data by Country

Environmental and Land-Use RegulationsThe Company faces certain 
risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislationor regulations, and actua
l or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion residuals),and certain air em
issions, such as SO 2 , NO X , PM, mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capitalexpenditures or other comp
liance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our U.S. or international subsidiaries, and our consolidated resultsof operations. For further in
formation about these risks, see Item 1A.— Risk Factors — Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws andregulations; Our businesses are subject 
to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies; and Regulators, politicians, non-governmentalorganizations and other private parties ha
ve expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate changeand are taking actions which could have a mat
erial adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of the laws and regul
ations of individual countries within each SBU where our subsidiaries operate, see discussion within Item 1.— Business of this Form 10-K under the applicab
le SBUs.Many of the countries in which th
e Company does business also have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting, ownership,operation, modificat
ion, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from, electric power generation or distribution assets. In addition, international projectsfunded by the Internationa
l Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders are subject to World Bankenvironmental standards o
r similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country standards. The Company often has used advanced generationtechnologies in order to m
inimize environmental impacts, such as CFB boilers and advanced gas turbines, and environmental control devices such as flue gasdesulphurization for SO 
2 emissions and selective catalytic reduction for NO x emissions.Environmental laws an
d regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently and have become morestringent over time. The Comp
any has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with these environmental laws andregulations. See Item 7 
.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financia l Condition and Results of Operations—Environmental Capital Expenditures in this Form 10-K for more detail. The Comp
any and its subsidiaries may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply with these regulations.There can be no assurance th
at the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company will be able to recover any of these compliance costs from theircounterparties or custo
mers such that the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would not be materially affected.Various licenses, permits 
and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental laws, can resultin fines, penalties, cap
ital expenditures, interruptions or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to litigation or regulatory actionrelating to environmen
tal permits or approvals. See Item 3. —Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more deta il with respect to environmental litigation andregulatory action.
United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations
In the U.S. the CAA and various state laws and regu
lations regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO 2 , NO X , PM, GHGs, mercury and otherhazardous air pollutants. Ce
rtain applicable rules are discussed in further detail below.CSAPR — 
The CSAPR requires significant reduct ions in SO 2 and NO X emissions from power plants in many states in which subsidiaries of the Companyoperate. Once fully impl
emented, the rule requires SO 2 emission reductions of 73%, and NO X reductions of 54%, from 2005 levels. The CSAPR is implemented,in part, through a market
-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissions allowances created by the EPA.The CSAPR contemplates limited int
erstate and unlimited intra-state trading of emissions allowances by covered sources. Initially, the EPA issued emissionsallowances to affect
ed power plants based on state emissions budgets established by the EPA under the CSAPR. The Company is required to comply with theCSAPR in several states, including Ohio, Indian
a, Oklahoma and Maryland. The Company complies with CSAPR through operation of existing controls andpurchases of allowances on the op
en market, as needed. While the Company's 2015 CSAPR compliance costs were immaterial, the future availability of and cost topurchase allowances to me
et the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time.The EPA issued an interim final 
rule establishing the following deadlines for implementation of the CSAPR:•
January 1, 2015: Phase 1 (2015 and 2016) began for annual trading programs. Existing units must have begun monitoring and reporting SO 2 and NO x emissions.
•
May 1, 2015: Phase 1 began for ozone-season NO x trading program. Existing units must have begun monitoring and reporting NO x emissions.•
December  1,  2015  (and  each  Dec.  1  thereafter):  Date  by  which  sources  must  demonstrate  compliance  with  ozone-season  NO x trading program (i.e.,allowance transfer deadline).
47

•March 1, 2016 (and each March 1 thereafter): Date by which sources must demonstrate compliance with annual trading programs (i.e., allowance transferdeadline).
•
January 1, 2017: Phase 2 (2017 and beyond) begins for annual trading programs. Assurance provisions in effect.•
May 1, 2017: Phase 2 (2017 and beyond) begins for ozone-season NO x trading program. Assurance provisions in effect.The EPA has released a proposed rule that would further reduce the amount of ozone season NO 
X allowances that would be available under the market-basedprogram,
 starting in 2017. This proposed rule would not affect annual SO 2 and NO X allowances. We cannot predict at this time the impact that implementation ofthe
 revised CSAPR will have on the Company. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries could be required to increase their capital expenditures, make operationalchanges
 or purchase additional allowances on the open market resulting in additional compliance costs to fully comply with the CSAPR, which expenditures andcosts could be material.
MATS — 
Pursuant to Section 112 of the CAA, the EPA published a fin al rule in 2012 called the MATS establishing National Emissions Standards forHazardous Air Pollutants from co
al and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. The rule required all coal-fired power plants to comply with the applicableMATS standards by April 2015, with the possibility o
f obtaining a one year extension, if needed, to complete the installation of necessary controls. To comply withthe rule, many coal-f
ired power plants may need to install additional control technology to control acid gases, mercury or PM, or they may need to repower with analternate fuel or 
retire operations. Most of the Company's U.S. coal-fired plants operated by the Company's subsidiaries comply with MATS as of April 16, 2015using existing control techno
logies. However, in some cases additional time for compliance was needed in order to make necessary capital and operational changes,particularly for old
er facilities lacking advanced control technologies. For a discussion of the deactivation and planned deactivation of certain units owned orpartially owned by IPL and DP&L as a resul
t of existing and expected environmental regulations, including MATS, see Unit Retirement and Replacement Generation 
below. IPL required additional t
ime for compliance beyond April 16, 2015. In December 2012, IDEM granted an extension to April 16, 2016 covering all coal-firedunits at Harding Street and Eag
le Valley, in addition to Unit 3 and Unit 4 at Petersburg. In February 2013, IDEM granted a three-month extension on PetersburgUnit 2 to July 16, 2015, and that unit, as well 
as Petersburg Unit 1, which did not receive an extension, is currently in compliance with MATS.On August 14, 2013, the IURC approved IPL's MATS plan, which included investing up to $511 
million in the installation of new pollution controlequipment on IPL's five larges
t base load generating units. These coal-fired units are located at IPL's Petersburg and Harding Street generating stations. The IURCalso approved IPL's request to re
cover operating and construction costs for this equipment (including a return) through a rate adjustment mechanism, with certainstipulations. IPL plans to spend a to
tal of $454 million for this project as approximately $57 million of costs will largely be avoided as a result of the approval forIPL's plans to refuel Harding Stre
et Station Unit 7 from coal to natural gas.Several lawsuits challeng
ing the MATS rule were filed by other parties and consolidated into a single proceeding before the United States Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbi
a Circuit (the "D.C Circuit"). On April 15, 2014, the D.C. Circuit denied the challenges. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Courtreversed the D.C. Circuit's decis
ion, and remanded MATS to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. On December 15, 2015, the D.C. Circuit issued an orderremanding MATS to the EPA without vacatur whil
e the EPA works to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision. The EPA published its revised appropriateand necessary finding on Decemb
er 1, 2015 and plans to finalize it by April 15, 2016. Further proceedings are expected; however, in the meantime MATS remainsin effect. We curr
ently cannot predict the outcome of this litigation, or its impact, if any, on our MATS compliance planning or ultimate costs.New Source Review ("NSR") — 
The NSR requirements under the CAA impose ce rtain requirements on major emission sources, such as electric generatingstations, if changes are 
made to the sources that result in a significant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, including power plant modifications, are excludedfrom these NSR requirements, i
f they meet the RMRR exclusion of the CAA. There is ongoing uncertainty, and significant litigation, regarding which projects fallwithin the RMRR exclusion. The EPA has pursued a coordina
ted compliance and enforcement strategy to address NSR compliance issues at the nation's coal-firedpower plants. The strategy has in
cluded both the filing of suits against power plant owners and the issuance of NOVs to a number of power plant owners allegingNSR violations. See Item 3.— 
Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more deta il with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including aNOV issued by the EPA against IPL concerning NSR and prevention of s
ignificant deterioration issues under the CAA.DP&L's Stuart Station and Hutchings Station hav
e received NOVs from the EPA alleging that certain activities undertaken in the past are outside the scopeof the RMRR exclusion. Additionally, gener
ation units partially owned by DP&L but operated by other utilities have received such NOVs relating to equipmentrepairs or replace
ments alleged to be outside the RMRR exclusion. The NOVs issued to DP&L-operated plants have not been pursued through litigation by theEPA.
If NSR requirements were imposed on 
any of the power plants owned by the Company's subsidiaries, the results could have a material adverse impact on theCompany's business, financial condi
tion and results of operations. In connection with the48

imposition of any such NSR requirements on IPL, the utility would seek recovery of any operating or capital expenditures related to air pollution controltechnology to reduce regul
ated air emissions, but not fines or penalties; however, there can be no assurances that they would be successful in that regard.Regional Haze Rule — 
The EPA's "Regional Haze Rule" is intended to r educe haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas, and sets guidelines fordetermining BART at affect
ed plants and how to demonstrate "reasonable progress" towards eliminating man-made haze by 2064. The Regional Haze Rulerequired states to consid
er five factors when establishing BART for sources, including the availability of emission controls, the cost of the controls and the effect ofreducing emission on visibil
ity in Class I areas (including wilderness areas, national parks and similar areas). The statute requires compliance within five yearsafter the EPA approves the re
levant SIP or issues a federal implementation plan, although individual states may impose more stringent compliance schedules.EPA previously determined that s
tates included in the CSAPR would not be required to make source-specific BART determinations for BART-affectedelectric genera
ting units, reasoning that the emissions reductions required by the CSAPR were "better than BART." Concurrently, EPA also finalized a limiteddisapproval of certain s
tates' plans — including Ohio's — that previously relied on the EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule to improve visibility and substituted aFederal Implementa
tion Plan that relies on the CSAPR. Environmental groups have challenged EPA's determination than the CSAPR is "better than BART." Thechallenge currently 
is proceeding in the D.C. Circuit.National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") — 
Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six principal pollutants cons idered harmful to publichealth and the environmen
t, including ozone, particulate matter, NO x and SO 2 , which result from coal combustion.  Areas meeting the NAAQS are designated"attainment areas" whi
le those that do not meet the NAAQS are considered "nonattainment areas." Each state must develop a plan to bring nonattainment areas intocompliance with the NAAQS, which may include 
imposing operating limits on individual plants. The EPA is required to review NAAQS at five-year intervals.Based on the current and potent
ial future ambient standards, certain of the states in which the Company's subsidiaries operate have determined or will berequired to determin
e whether certain areas within such states meet the NAAQS. Some of these states may be required to modify their State Implementation Plansto detail how the states wil
l regain their attainment status. As part of this process, it is possible that the applicable state environmental regulatory agency or the EPAmay require reductions of
 emissions from our generating stations to reach attainment status for ozone, fine particulate matter, NO x or SO 2 . The compliance costsof the Company's U.S. subsidiaries could be m
aterial.On September 30, 2015, IDEM published its fina
l rule establishing reduced SO 2 limits for IPL facilities in accordance with a new one-hour standard of 75parts per billion, for th
e areas in which IPL's Harding Street, Petersburg, and Eagle Valley Generating Stations operate. The expected compliance date for theserequirements is January 1, 2017. No i
mpact is expected for Eagle Valley or Harding Street Generating Stations because these facilities will cease coal combustionprior to the complianc
e date. It is expected that improvements to the existing FGDs at Petersburg will be required in order to comply. IPL has engaged anengineering firm to fu
rther assess potential compliance measures and associated costs and timing. While costs associated with the proposed rule cannot accuratelybe predicted at this time, t
hey could be material.Greenhouse Gas Emissions — 
In January 2011, the EPA began regulating GHG emiss ions from certain stationary sources under the so-called "TailoringRule." The regulations are be
ing implemented pursuant to two CAA programs: the Title V Operating Permit program and the program requiring a permit ifundergoing certain new constru
ction or major modifications, known as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD"). Obligations relating to Title V permitsinclude record-keeping 
and monitoring requirements. Sources subject to PSD can be required to implement BACT. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruledthat the EPA had exceeded its st
atutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule by regulating under the PSD program sources based solely on their GHG emissions.However, the U.S. Supreme Court also held that 
the EPA could impose GHG BACT requirements for sources already required to implement PSD for certain otherpollutants. Therefore, i
f future modifications to our U.S.-based businesses' sources require PSD review for other pollutants, it may trigger GHG BACTrequirements. The EPA has issued guidan
ce on what BACT entails for the control of GHG and has now proposed new source performance standards ("NSPS") formodified and reconstruc
ted units (see below) that will serve as a floor (maximum emission rate) for future BACT requirements. Individual states are now requiredto determine what contro
ls are required for facilities within their jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. The ultimate impact of the BACT requirements applicable tous on our operations cannot be det
ermined at this time as our U.S.-based businesses will not be required to implement BACT until one of them constructs a newmajor source or makes a 
major modification of an existing major source. However, the cost of compliance could be material.On October 23, 2015, the EPA's rule establishing new sour
ce performance standards ("NSPS") for new electric generating units became effective. The NSPSestablish CO 
2 emissions standards of 1400 lbs/MWh for newly constructed coal-fueled electric generating plants, which reflects the partial capture and storage ofCO 
2 emissions from the plants. The NSPS for large, newly constructed NGCC facilities is 1,000 lbs/MWh. These standards apply to any electric generating unitwith construction
49

commencing after January 8, 2014. The EPA also promulgated NSPS applicable to modified and reconstructed electric generating units, which will serve as a floorfor future BACT determinations 
for such units. The NSPS applicable to modified and reconstructed coal-fired units will be 1,800 lbs CO 2 /MWh for sources withheat input greater th
an 2,000 MMBtu per hour. For smaller sources, below 2,000 MMBtu per hour, the standard is 2,000 lbs CO 2 /MWh. The NSPS could have animpact on the Company's plans to cons
truct and/or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations.On December 22, 2015, the EPA's final CO 
2 emission rules for existing power plants under Clean Air Act Section 111(d) (called the Clean Power Plan (the"CPP")) also became effect
ive. The CPP provides for interim emissions performance rates that must be achieved beginning in 2022 and final emissionsperformance rates 
that must be achieved starting in 2030. Under the CPP, states are required to meet state-wide emission rate standards or equivalent mass-basedstandards, with the goal being a 32
% reduction in total U.S. power sector emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The CPP requires states to submit, by 2016,implementation plans 
to meet the standards or a request for an extension to 2018. If a state fails to develop and submit an approvable implementation plan, the EPAwill finalize a fed
eral plan for that state. The full impact of the CPP will depend on the following:   •    whether and how the states in which th
e Company's U.S. businesses operate respond to the CPP;   •  whether the states adopt an 
emissions trading regime and, if so, which trading regime;   •  how other states respond to the CPP, which will a
ffect the size and robustness of any emissions trading market; and   •  how other companies may respond in 
the face of increased carbon costs.Several states and industry g
roups filed petitions in the D.C. Circuit challenging the CPP and requested a stay of the rule while the challenge was considered.The D.C. Circuit denied the stay and gr
anted requests to consider the challenges on an expedited basis. As a result, the D.C. Circuit may issue an opinion on thesechallenges prior to the 
end of 2016. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the CPP pending resolution ofchallenges to the rule.
Because we likely will not know the answe
rs to the above questions regarding the CPP until 2018 or later, because the first compliance period will not enduntil 2025, and because we cannot pr
edict whether the CPP will survive the legal challenges, it is too soon to determine the CPP's potential impact on our business,operations or financia
l condition, but any such impact could be material.Cooling Water Intake — 
The Company's facilities a re subject to a variety of rules governing water use and discharge. In particular, the Company's U.S.facilities are sub
ject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule issued by the EPA that seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by requiring existing steam electricgenerating facili
ties to utilize the Best Technology Available ("BTA") for cooling water intake structures. On August 15, 2014, the EPA published its finalstandards to protect fish 
and other aquatic organisms drawn into cooling water systems at large power plants and other industrial facilities. These standards requiresubject faciliti
es that utilize at least 25% of the withdrawn water exclusively for cooling purposes and have a design intake flow of greater than two million gallonsper day to choose among seven BTA options to r
educe fish impingement. In addition, facilities that withdraw at least 125 million gallons per day for coolingpurposes must conduct studies to ass
ist permitting authorities to determine whether and what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainmentof aquatic organisms. This de
cision-making process would include public input as part of permit renewal or permit modification. It is possible this process couldresult in the need to inst
all closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cycle cooling towers), or other technology. Finally, the standards require that new units added toan existing facility to increa
se generation capacity are required to reduce both impingement and entrainment that achieves one of two alternatives under nationalBTA standards for entrainment. 
It is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this recent final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule andthe outcome of any such chal
lenges. However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material.AES Southland's current plan to comply with 
the California State Water Resources Board's regulations will see all once-through-cooled generating unitsretired from servi
ce by December 31, 2020. New air-cooled combined cycle gas turbine generators and battery energy storage systems will be constructed at theAES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach generating st
ations. The execution of the Implementation Plan is entirely dependent on the Company's ability to executeon long-term power purchase ag
reements to support project financing of the replacement units. The SWRCB is currently reviewing the Implementation Plan andlatest update information to
 evaluate the impact on electrical system reliability.  Power purchase agreements for the new generating capacity are currently underreview by the California Publi
c Utilities Commission.Power plants will be required to 
comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirements are morestringent and have earl
ier compliance dates than the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's California assets. Challenges to thefederal EPA's rule have been conso
lidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although implementation of the rule has not been stayed while thechallenges proceed. The Company 
anticipates once-through cooling and CWA Section 316(b) compliance regulations and costs would have a material impact onour consolidated financi
al condition or results of operations.50

Water Discharges — Certain of the Company's U.S.-based businesses are subject to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits that regulatespecific industrial was
te water and storm water discharges to the waters of the U.S. under the CWA. On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers published a final 
rule defining federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S.. This rule, which became effective on August 28, 2015, may expand orotherwise change the number 
and types of waters or features subject to federal permitting. On October 9, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitissued an order to tempora
rily stay the "Waters of the U.S." rule nationwide while that court determines whether it has authority to hear the challenges to therule. The order was in response to 
challenges brought by 18 states and followed an August 2015 court decision in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota to staythe rule in 13 other stat
es. We cannot predict the duration of the nationwide or partial stay of the rule or the outcome of this litigation; however, if the ruleultimately survives th
e legal challenges, it could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.On January 7, 2013, the Ohio Environmental Prot
ection Agency issued an NPDES permit for J.M. Stuart Station. The primary issues involve the temperatureand thermal discharges 
from the Station including the point at which the water quality standards are applied, i.e., whether water quality standards apply at the pointwhere the Station discharge 
canal discharges into the Ohio River, or whether, as the EPA alleges, the discharge canal is an extension of Little Three Mile Creek andthe water quality standar
ds apply at the point where water enters the discharge canal. In addition, there are a number of other water-related permit requirementsestablished with respect 
to metals and other materials contained in the discharges from the Station. The NPDES permit establishes interim standards related to thethermal discharge fo
r 54 months that are comparable to current levels of discharge by Stuart Station. Permanent standards for both temperature and overall thermaldischarges are establ
ished as of 55 months after the permit is effective, except that an additional transitional period of approximately 22 months is allowed ifcompliance with the per
manent standards is to be achieved through a plan of construction and various milestones on the construction schedule are met. It isbelieved that compli
ance with the permit as written will require capital expenses that will be material to DP&L. The cost of compliance and the timing of suchcosts is uncertain and may v
ary considerably depending on a compliance plan that would need to be developed, the type of capital projects that may be necessary,and the uncertainties that ma
y arise in the likely event that permits and approvals from other governmental entities would likely be required to construct andoperate any such capita
l project. DP&L has appealed various aspects of the final permit to the Environmental Review Appeals Commission and a hearing has beenscheduled for March 2016. The comp
liance schedule in the final permit has been modified to accommodate the timing of the hearing. The outcome of such appealis uncertain.
On August 28, 2012, the IDEM issued NPDES permits to the IPL Petersburg, Hard
ing Street and Eagle Valley generating stations, which became effective inOctober 2012. NPDES permits regulate spec
ific industrial wastewater and storm water discharges to the waters of Indiana under Sections 402 and 405 of the U.S.Clean Water Act. These per
mits set new water quality-based effluent discharge limits for the Harding Street and Petersburg facilities, as well as monitoring andother requirements des
igned to protect aquatic life, with full compliance required by October 2015. IPL received an extension to the compliance deadline throughSeptember 29, 2017 for IPL's Harding Stree
t and Petersburg facilities through agreed orders with IDEM. IPL conducted studies to determine the operationalchanges and control equipmen
t necessary to comply with the new limitations. In October 2014, IPL filed its wastewater compliance plans for its power plants withthe IURC. On July 29, 2015, the IURC approved a Certificat
e of Public Convenience and Necessity to convert Unit 7 at the Harding Street Station from coal-firedto natural gas-fired 
(about 410 MW net capacity), and also to install and operate wastewater treatment technologies at Harding Street Station and PetersburgGeneration Station. IPL plans to inv
est $319 million in these projects to ensure compliance with the wastewater treatment requirements by September 29, 2017.On November 3, 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rul
e to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by power plants. These effluentlimitations for exis
ting and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash and more stringent effluent limitations for fluegas de-sulfurization wast
ewater. Compliance time lines for existing sources will be established by the applicable permitting authorities and will be set as soon asdetermined possible, but no soone
r than November 1, 2018 and no later than December 31, 2023. Challenges to this rule are being consolidated in the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
IPL expects to recover through its environmental rate adjustment mechanism any operating or capital expenditures related tocompliance with the ef
fluent limitations requirements. Recovery of these costs is sought through an Indiana statute that allows for 80% recovery of qualifying coststhrough a rate adjustment
 mechanism with the remainder recorded as a regulatory asset to be considered for recovery in the next base rate case proceeding;however, there can be no assuran
ces that IPL will be successful in that regard. In light of the uncertainties at this time, we cannot predict the impact of theseregulations on our consolidat
ed results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, but it could be material.Waste Management — 
In the course of operations, the Company's facilities generate solid and liquid waste materials requiring eventual disposal orprocessing. With the excep
tion of coal combustion residuals ("CCR"), the wastes are not usually physically disposed of on our property, but are shipped off site forfinal disposal, treat
ment or recycling. CCR, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes, is disposed of at some of our coal-fired powergeneration plant sites us
ing engineered, permitted landfills. Waste materials generated at our electric power and distribution facilities may include CCR, oil, scrapmetal, rubbish, small quan
tities of industrial hazardous wastes such as spent solvents, tree and land clearing wastes and PCB contaminated liquids and solids. TheCompany endeavors to ensure that 
all of its solid and liquid wastes are51

disposed of in accordance with applicable national, regional, state and local regulations. On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating CCR under the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act beca
me effective. The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currentlyoperating landfills and su
rface impoundments, and may impose closure and/or corrective action requirements for existing CCR landfills and impoundments undercertain specified 
conditions. The primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation would be actions commenced by the states and private lawsuits. TheCompany's U.S. subsidiaries are still 
analyzing the potential impact and compliance cost associated with this final rule, and there can be no assurance that theCompany's businesses, financial cond
ition or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such rule.Senate Bill 251 — 
In May 2011, Senate Bill 251 became a law in the state of Indiana. Senate Bill 251 is a comprehensive bill that, among other things,provides Indiana utilit
ies, including IPL, with a means for recovering 80% of costs incurred to comply with federal mandates through a periodic retail rateadjustment mechanism. Th
is includes costs to comply with regulations from the EPA, FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, Department ofEnergy, etc., including capi
tal intensive requirements and/or proposals described herein, such as cooling water intake regulations, waste management and coalcombustion byproducts, wastewater 
effluent, MISO transmission expansion costs and polychlorinated biphenyls. It does not change existing legislation that allowsfor 100% recovery of cle
an coal technology designed to reduce air pollutants.Some of the most important 
features of Senate Bill 251 to IPL are as follows. Any energy utility in Indiana seeking to recover federally mandated costsincurred in connection with 
a compliance project shall apply to the IURC for a CPCN for the compliance project. It presents certain factors that the IURC mustconsider in determining whe
ther to grant a CPCN. It further specifies that if the IURC approves a proposed compliance project and the projected federallymandated costs associat
ed with the project, the following apply: (i) 80% of the approved costs shall be recovered by the energy utility through a periodic retail rateadjustment mechanism
; (ii) 20% of the approved costs shall be deferred and recovered by the energy utility as part of the next general rate case filed with theIURC; and (iii) actual costs 
exceeding the projected federally mandated costs of the approved compliance project by more than 25% shall require specificjustification and approv
al before being authorized in the energy utility's next general rate case. Senate Bill 251 also requires the IURC to adopt rules to establish avoluntary clean energy por
tfolio standard program. Such program will provide incentives to participating electricity suppliers to obtain specified percentages ofelectricity from clean energy so
urces in accordance with clean portfolio standard goals, including requiring at least 50% of the clean energy to originate fromIndiana suppliers. The goals c
an also be met by purchasing clean energy credits.CERCLA — 
The Comprehensive Environmenta l Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (aka "Superfund") may be the source of claims againstcertain of the Company's U.S. subsidiar
ies from time to time. There is ongoing litigation at a site known as the South Dayton Landfill where a group of companiesalready recognized as po
tentially responsible parties ("PRPs") have sued DP&L and other unrelated entities seeking a contribution toward the costs of assessmentand remediation. DP&L is act
ively opposing such claims. In 2003, DP&L received notice that the EPA considers DP&L to be a PRP at the Tremont City landfillSuperfund site. EPA has taken no further 
action with respect to DP&L since 2003 regarding the Tremont City landfill. The Company is unable to determinewhether there will be any l
iability, or the size of any liability that may ultimately be assessed against DP&L at these two sites, but any such liability could bematerial to DP&L.
Unit Retirement and Replacement Genera
tion — In the second quarter of 2013, IPL r etired in place five oil-fired peaking units with an average life ofapproximately 61 years (
approximately 168 MW net capacity in total), as such units were not equipped with the advanced environmental control technologiesneeded to comply with existing 
and expected environmental regulations. Although these units represented approximately 5% of IPL's generating capacity, theywere seldom dispatched by Midcon
tinent Independent System Operator, Inc. in recent years due to their relatively higher production cost and in some instancesrepairs were needed. In add
ition to these recently retired units, IPL has several other generating units that it expects to retire or refuel by 2017. These units areprimarily coal-f
ired and represent 472 MW of net capacity in total. To replace this generation, in April 2013, IPL filed a petition and case-in-chief with the IURCin April 2013 seeking a CPCN to build a 550 to 725 MW CCGT at its Eagl
e Valley Station site in Indiana and to refuel Harding Street Station Units 5 and 6 fromcoal to natural gas (106 MW n
et capacity each). In May 2014, the IURC issued an order on the CPCN authorizing the refueling project and granting approval tobuild a 644 to 685 MW CCGT at a total budget of $649 
million. The current estimated cost of these projects is $632 million. IPL was granted authority to accruepost in-service allowanc
e for debt and equity funds used during construction and to defer the recognition of depreciation expense of the CCGT and refuelingproject until such tim
e that we are allowed to collect both a return and depreciation expense on the CCGT and refueling project. The CCGT is expected to beplaced into service in Apr
il 2017, and the refueling project was completed in December 2015. The costs to build and operate the CCGT and for the refuelingproject, other than fue
l costs, will not be recoverable by IPL through rates until the conclusion of a base rate case proceeding with the IURC after the assets havebeen placed in service.
As a result of existing and expe
cted environmental regulations, including MATS, DP&L notified PJM of its plan to retire the six coal-fired units aggregatingapproximately 360 MW at i
ts wholly-owned Hutchings Generation Station. Hutchings Unit 4 was retired in June 2013. In conjunction with administrativeagreements reached 
in 2013 with the EPA and Ohio's Regional52

Air Pollution Control Authority that resolved alleged violations of air quality standards, DP&L accelerated its plans with respect to Hutchings Units 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6and those units were each re
tired by June 2015. DP&L removed equipment from such units so that combustion of coal was not possible after September 2013.Conversion of the coal-fir
ed units to natural gas was investigated, but the cost of investment exceeded the expected return. In addition, DP&L ownedapproximately 207 MW of coa
l-fired generation at Beckjord Unit 6, which was operated by Duke Energy Ohio. Beckjord Unit 6 was retired effective October 1,2014. At this time, DP&L does not have plans to 
replace the units that have been or will be retired.International Environmental Regulations

You should consider carefully the fo
llowing risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Additionalrisks and uncertainties also may advers
ely affect our business and operations including those discussed in Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations 
in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financialcondition could be materially ad
versely affected.We routinely encounter 
and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different, than we presentlyanticipate. The cat
egories of risk we have identified in Item 1A.— Risk Factors of this Form 10-K include the fol lowing:•
risks related to our high level of indebtedness;•
risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital;•
external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility;•
risks associated with our operations; and•
risks associated with governmental regulation and laws.These risk factors should be r
ead in conjunction with Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financia l Condition and Results of Operations , and the Consolidated Financial St
atements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.Risks Related to our High Level of Indebtedness
We have a significant amount of debt, a large per
centage of which is secured, which could adversely affect our business and the ability to fulfill ourobligations.
As of 
December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $20.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a conso lidated basis. All outstanding borrowings under TheAES Corporation's senior secured cred
it facility are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capital stock of many of The AES Corporation'sdirectly held subsidiar
ies. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. Since we havesuch a high level of debt, a subst
antial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significantpercentage of our assets 
are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces ourflexibility in deal
ing with these secured assets. This high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and ourinvestors, including:
•
making it more diffi cult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and/or individual subsidiaries;•
increasing the likel ihood of a downgrade of our debt, which could cause future debt costs and/or payments to increase under our debt and related hedginginstruments and consume an ev
en greater portion of cash flow;•
increasing our vulnerabi lity to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign exchange ratesand commodity prices;
•
reducing the availabi lity of cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;•
limiting our flexibi lity in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;•
placing us at a competi tive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and•
limiting, along with the f inancial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds asneeded or take advantage o
f business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.The agreements governing our 
indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additionalindebtedness. To the extent we be
come more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements in the future may begreater than expect
ed. Accordingly, our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, wemay not be able to borrow
55

money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. See Note 12 —Debt included in Item 8. of this Form 10-K for a sch
edule of our debt maturities.The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on i
ts outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, isdependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiari
es by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.The AES Corporation is a holding company with no m
aterial assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. All of The AES Corporation's revenue isgenerated through its subsidi
aries. Accordingly, almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries.Therefore, The AES Corporation's abil
ity to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of itssubsidiaries to generat
e cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans orotherwise.
However, our subsidiaries face v
arious restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to The AES Corporation. Most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuantto loan agreements, inden
tures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may makedistributions to The AES Corporation. In add
ition, the payment of dividends or the making of loans, advances or other payments to The AES Corporation may besubject to other contra
ctual, legal or regulatory restrictions or may be prohibited altogether. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may limit theamount of retained ea
rnings that may be distributed to us as a dividend. Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to The AESCorporation as a result of fo
reign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Any right that The AES Corporation has toreceive any assets of any o
f its subsidiaries upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, insolvency or similarproceedings (and the consequen
t right of the holders of The AES Corporation's indebtedness to participate in the distribution of, or to realize proceeds from, thoseassets) will be effec
tively subordinated to the claims of any such subsidiary's creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary).The AES Corporation's subsidiaries are s
eparate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of The AES Corporation'sindebtedness, have no obligation, 
contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees,loans or other payments.
Even though The AES Corporation is a holding company, existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or a
ffiliates could adversely affect TheAES Corporation.
We attempt to finan
ce our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents which, except as noted below, require theloans to be repaid solely f
rom the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock,physical assets, contrac
ts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. This type of financing is usually referred to as non-recourse debt or "non-recoursefinancing." In some non-recou
rse financings, The AES Corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most ofwhich by their terms will only b
e effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. These obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees,indemnities, letter of credit reimb
ursement agreements and agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties.As of 
December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $20.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a conso lidated basis, of which approximately $5.0 billion was recourse debt of The AES Corporation and 
approximately $15.8 billion was non-recourse debt. In addit ion, we have outstanding guarantees, indemnities, letters ofcredit, and other cred
it support commitments which are further described in this Form 10-K in Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
— Capital Resources and Liquidity — Parent Company Liquidity . Some of our subsidiaries are 
currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in ourConsolidated Balance Sheets re
lated to such defaults was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2015 . While the lenders under ou r non-recourse financings generally donot have direct recours
e to The AES Corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by The AES Corporation), defaults thereunder can still haveimportant consequences fo
r The AES Corporation, including, without limitation:•
reducing The AES Corporation's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project subsidiary willtypically be prohibited 
from distributing cash to The AES Corporation during the pendency of any default;•
under certain circumstances, triggering The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other creditsupport which The AES Corporation has provided to or on b
ehalf of such subsidiary;•
causing The AES Corporation to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets;56

•triggering defaults in The AES Corporation's outstanding debt and trust preferred securities. For example, The AES Corporation's senior secured creditfacility and outstanding s
enior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, The AESCorporation's seni
or secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding material debt of material subsidiariesor any subsidiaries t
hat in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary;•
the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company; or•
foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse loans, therefore eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from thoseassets.
None of the projects
 that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate meet the applicable standard of materiality inThe AES Corporation's senior secured cr
edit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration undersuch indebtedness. However, as a resul
t of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position andresults of operations, it 
is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materialityand thereby upon an accele
ration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under The AES Corporation'ssenior secured credit 
facility or other indebtedness of The AES Corporation.Risks Associated with our Ability to Raise Needed Capital
The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, has significant cash requirements and limited sources o
f liquidity.The AES Corporation requires cash pri
marily to fund:•
principal repayments of debt;•
interest and preferred dividends;•
acquisitions;•
construction and other project commitments;•
other equity commitments, including business development investments;•
equity repurchases and/or cash dividends on our common stock;•
taxes; and•
Parent Company overhead costs.The AES Corporation's principal sources o
f liquidity are:•
dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries;•
proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level; and•
proceeds from asset sales.For a more detailed discuss
ion of The AES Corporation's cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Resul
ts of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity in this Form 10-K. While we believe that 
these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the Parent Company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on anumber of material 
assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating andfinancial perform
ance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. Any number of assumptionscould prove to be incorrec
t, and, therefore there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will notbe greater than expec
ted. For example, in recent years, certain financial institutions have gone bankrupt. In the event that a bank who is party to our senior securedcredit facility o
r other facilities goes bankrupt or is otherwise unable to fund its commitments, we would need to replace that bank in our syndicate or risk areduction in the size of 
the facility, which would reduce our liquidity. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principaloutstanding under our credit 
facility and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful inobtaining such refinancing on 
terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us.Our ability to grow our business could be materially adv
ersely affected if we were unable to raise capital on favorable terms.From time to time, we re
ly on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. Our ability toarrange for financing on 
either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond ourcontrol, including:
57

•general economic and capital market conditions;•
the availability of bank credit;•
investor confidence;•
the financial condition, performance and prospects of The AES Corporation in general and/or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing as well ascompanies in our industry or si
milar financial circumstances; and•
changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital.Should future access to capi
tal not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants or expand or improve existing facilities,either of which would affec
t our future growth, results of operations or financial condition.A downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversel
y affect our ability to access the capital markets which couldincrease our interest costs or adversel
y affect our liquidity and cash flow.If any of the credit r
atings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could beimpaired and our borrowing costs 
could increase. Furthermore, depending on The AES Corporation's credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debtsecurities, counterpa
rties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to provide credit support. Accordingly,with respect to both new and exist
ing commitments, The AES Corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of creditand/or collateral, 
to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporation. There can be no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guaranteesor that AES could arrange such fur
ther assurances in the future. In addition, to the extent The AES Corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit orother collateral 
to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to The AES Corporation to meet its other liquidity needs.We may not be able to raise suffic
ient capital to fund developing projects in certain less developed economies which could change or in some casesadversely affect our growth strategy.
Part of our strategy is to grow our bus
iness by developing businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may be greater thanprojects in more develop
ed economies. Commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non-recourse project financing in certain less developedeconomies, and in these situ
ations we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from alimited number of multilateral or 
bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. As a precondition to making such project financing available, the lendinginstitutions may also requ
ire governmental guarantees of certain project and sovereign related risks. There can be no assurance, however, that project financingfrom the internation
al financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project orinvest more of our own funds which may not b
e in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects.External Risks Associated with Revenue and Earnings Volatility
Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be 
exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricitymarkets, which could have a material adverse 
effect on our financial performance.Some of our businesses sell ele
ctricity in the spot markets in cases where they operate at levels in excess of their power sales agreements or retail loadobligations. Our businesses may also buy 
electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in thosemarkets. The open market
 wholesale prices for electricity can be volatile and often reflect the fluctuating cost of fuels such as coal, natural gas or oil derivativefuels in addition to other 
factors described below. Consequently, any changes in the supply and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the openmarket wholesale pric
e of electricity.Volatility in market p
rices for fuel and electricity may result from among other things:•
plant availability in the markets generally;•
availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;•
competition;•
electricity usage;•
seasonality;•
foreign exchange rate fluctuation;•
availability and price of emission credits;•
hydrology and other weather conditions;•
illiquid markets;•
transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;58

•availability of competitively priced renewables sources;•
increased adoption of distributed generation;•
available supplies of natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal;•
generating unit performance;•
natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events;•
energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;•
geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas;•
general economic conditions in areas where we operate which impact energy consumption; and•
bidding behavior and market bidding rules.Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuat
e significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreignoperations.
Our exposure to currency exchang
e rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements, as we
ll as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. While theConsolidated Financial State
ments are reported in U.S. Dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the localcurrency as the function
al currency and translated into U.S. Dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of theU.S. Dollar relative to the lo
cal currencies where our subsidiaries outside the U.S. report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while ourexpenses with respect to for
eign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extentreceipts and expenditur
es are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result ofadverse exchange rate 
fluctuations. Our financial position and results of operations could be affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies. SeeItem 7A. 
—Quantitative and Qualitative Dis closures about Market Risk to this Form 10-K for further in formation.We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in co
mmodity prices or interest rates.We routinely enter into co
ntracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lowerour financial exposure r
elated to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase andsales contracts, futur
es, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help usmanage our interest r
ate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and thecoverage will vary over t
ime. Furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. In particular, if prices ofcommodities or interest rates 
significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changesdeviates from histori
cal norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest ratesmay negatively impac
t our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedgingactivities may not qua
lify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer lossesassociated with "basis risk" which 
is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the targeted underlying exposure. Furthermore, there is a riskthat the current counterparties
 to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements.Our coal-fired faci
lities in the US continue to face substantial challenges as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, particularly those which aremerchant plants that 
are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place but purchase fuel atmarket prices or under sho
rt term contracts. For our businesses with PPA pricing that does not perfectly pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt tomanage the exposure through f
lexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts maynot be successful and the resu
lting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.Supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the Company 
to significant financial credit or performance risks.We often rely on a single 
contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for theoperation of certain o
f our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposingus to market price vola
tility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could adversely impact theprofitability of the 
affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach of agreements with other counterparties, including, withoutlimitation, offtak
ers or lenders.59

At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-termagreements that ac
count for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. We have also hedged a portion of our exposure to power pricefluctuations through forward 
fixed price power sales. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. We may not beable to enter into rep
lacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. If we were unable to enter into replacement PPAs, thesebusinesses may have to sell power 
at market prices. A breach by a counterparty of a PPA or other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements,including, without limita
tion, the debt documents of the affected business.The failure of any supplie
r or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to The AES Corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effecton our financial results. Consequ
ently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers andcustomers.
The market pricing of our common stock has been volat
ile and may continue to be volatile in future periods.The market price for ou
r common stock has been volatile in the past, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. Stockprice movements on a quar
ter-by-quarter basis for the past two years are presented in Item 5.— Market — Market Information of this Form 10-K. Factors that could affect the pri
ce of our common stock in the future include general conditions in our industry, in the power markets in which we participate and in the world,including environmental 
and economic developments, over which we have no control, as well as developments specific to us, including, risks that could result inrevenue and earnings volat
ility as well as other risk factors described in Item 1A.— Risk Factors and those matters descr ibed in Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and R
esults of Operations . Risks Associated with our Operations
We do a significant amount of business outside the United States, 
including in developing countries, which presents significant risks.A significant amount of our r
evenue is generated outside the United States and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted indeveloping countries. Part of ou
r growth strategy is to expand our business in certain developing countries in which AES has an existing presence as such countriesmay have higher growth rates 
and offer greater opportunities to expand from our platforms, with potentially higher returns than in some more developed countries.International operations, 
particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties,including, without limita
tion:•
economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;•
adverse changes in currency exchange rates;•
government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;•
unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;•
high inflation and monetary fluctuations;•
restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;•
threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;•
risks relating to the failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom Bribery Act or other anti-bribery laws applicable to ouroperations;
•
difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with GAAP expertise;•
unwillingness of governments and their agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;•
unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of theCompany and economically unfavo
rable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;•
inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;•
adverse changes in government tax policy;•
difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and•
potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.Any of these factors, by itsel
f or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our operations may experien
ce volatility in revenues and operating margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results ofoperations and cash flows. The vola
tility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced inmany of these
60

countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. A number of our businesses arefacing challenges assoc
iated with regulatory changes. The operation of power generation, distribution and transmission faci
lities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results. Weand/or our subsidiaries may not have adequate risk mitiga
tion and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.We are in the business
 of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance,including:
•
changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipmentfailure, failure o
f transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply withregulatory or permit 
requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures, explosions, terrorist acts,cyber attacks or other similar
 occurrences; and•
changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation;purchased electric
ity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capitalexpenditures to install 
environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.Our businesses require reli
able transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources toaccess and conduct operat
ions. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations, orinterruptions in this inf
rastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting thisinfrastructure or the facilities of
 our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have a material adverse effect on our businesses'results of operations, fin
ancial condition and prospects.In addition, a portio
n of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capital expendituresfor maintenance. The equ
ipment at our plants, whether old or new, is also likely to require periodic upgrading, improvement or repair, and replacement equipmentor parts may be difficu
lt to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. The inability to obtain replacementequipment or parts may i
mpact the ability of our plants to perform and could, therefore, have a material impact on our business and results of operations.Breakdown or failure
 of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certainsituations, could res
ult in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for liquidated damages and/or other penalties.As a result of the above risks and o
ther potential hazards associated with the power generation, distribution and transmission industries, we may from time totime become exposed to sign
ificant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardousactivities, including acquiri
ng, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission anddistribution systems. In addi
tion to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse andmachinery failure, 
are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions ofthird parties or other 
external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existenceof operational procedur
es, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, thepossibility of the occurr
ence and impact of these risks.The hazards described above, 
along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severedamage to and destruction o
f property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of anyone of these events may resu
lt in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injuryand fines and/or penalti
es. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will besufficient or effe
ctive under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A claim for which we are not fully insured orinsured at all could hurt ou
r financial results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to the cyclical nature of the insurance markets, we cannotprovide assurance that insu
rance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any losses not covered byinsurance could have a ma
terial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Our businesses' insurance does not cove
r every potential risk associated with its operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable.In addition, insurance may no
t fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrenceof a significant advers
e event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results or operations,financial condition and p
rospects.61

Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our inability to attract and retain skill
ed people could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Our operating success and abil
ity to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additionalqualified personnel who have exp
erience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. Theinability to attract and retain 
qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualifiedreplacements. For examp
le, we routinely are required to assess the financial impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. Theseassessments are dependent on h
iring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in U.S. GAAP to timely and accurately comply with U.S. reportingobligations. An inability to m
aintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect onour financial and tax r
eporting.We have contractual obligations to certa
in customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for loadrequirements and may result in increased operat
ing costs to certain of our businesses.We have contractual ob
ligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The uncertainty regarding theamount of power that our power gene
ration and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. A significantunder- or over-estima
tion of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which casewe would be required to buy or sell power 
from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase ouroperating costs.
We may not be able to enter into long-t
erm contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. Even when we successfully enter into long-termcontracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a lim
ited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers.Many of our generation plants 
conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by reducing thevolatility associat
ed with power and input costs and providing a stable revenue and cost structure. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or alimited number of custo
mers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. Theremaining terms of th
e power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuelprices by entering into long
-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent onthe continued ability of 
customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of ourlong-term power sales agr
eements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current marketprices. The loss of signific
ant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling ourobligations thereunder, cou
ld adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business,results of operations and f
inancial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-termcontracts, either wher
e our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of ourbusinesses to purchase inputs at 
market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.We have sought to reduce count
erparty credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or othercustomers of strong credi
t quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations. However, many of our customersdo not have, or have failed to 
maintain, an investment-grade credit rating, and our generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do,the government does not always hav
e an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographicareas in order to mit
igate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful.Competition is increasing and could adversely a
ffect us.The power production markets in whi
ch we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive anddiversified developmental or
 operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, inrecent years, the power produ
ction industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements andacquiring existing power gene
ration assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, inmany cases, have caused highe
r acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets andthe development of highly e
fficient gas-fired power plants have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell orintend to sell power. These comp
etitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us.62

Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significantcontributions.
Certain of our subsidiaries h
ave defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the thirty one such defined benefitplans, five are at U.S. subsidiar
ies and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including anexpected long-term r
ate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the presentvalue of future pension oblig
ations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pensionobligations under the pension pl
an. The Company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund therespective pension obliga
tions. The Company's exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plansinclude a significant we
ighting of investments in fixed income securities that are less volatile than investments in equity securities. Future downturns in the debtand/or equity markets, or 
the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result inan increase in pension expens
e and future funding requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible forsatisfying the funding requi
rements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations underthe pension plan. This may necess
itate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the Parent Company and our subsidiaries'liquidity.
For additional informat
ion regarding the funding position of the Company's pension plans, see Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
— Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Pension and Other Postretirement Plans and Note 15— Benefit Plans included in Item 8.— 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in this Form 10-K. Our business is subject to substantial development uncerta
inties.Certain of our subsidiaries 
and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing power plants, some but not all of which have signed long-termcontracts or made sim
ilar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to,risks relating to siting, 
financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of thepower sales contract as
 a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. For additional information regarding our projects under construction see, Item 1.— Business — 
Our Organization and Segments included in this Form 10-K. In certain cases, our subsid
iaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though the subsidiaries have not yet secured financing, powerpurchase arrangements, o
r other aspects of the development process. For example, in certain cases, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin theconstruction process or seek 
to procure equipment even where they do not have financing or a power purchase agreement in place (or conversely, to enter into apower purchase, procurement o
r other agreement without financing in place). If the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may remain obligated for certainliabilities even though 
the project will not proceed. Development is inherently uncertain and we may forgo certain development opportunities and we mayundertake significant devel
opment costs before determining that we will not proceed with a particular project. We believe that capitalized costs for projects underdevelopment are recoverable; h
owever, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If thesedevelopment efforts a
re not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the timeof abandonment, we would expense all 
capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any relatedcontingent liabilities.
In some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted prot
ective rights to minority shareholders or we own less than a majority of theequity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control 
the project or business, which entails certain risks.We have invested in some jo
int ventures where our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights with our joint venturepartners. In many cases, we m
ay exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on the board of the joint venturecompany or on management co
mmittees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not alwayshave this type of influenc
e over the project or business in every instance and we may be dependent on our joint venture partners or the management team of thejoint venture to operat
e, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or businesses. Our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint venturesmay not have the level 
of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businessesoptimally, and they may not sh
are our business priorities. In some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we haveentered into shareholde
r agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders.The approval of joint ventur
e partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our interest inprojects or businesses. The cont
rol or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may63

result in operational management and/or investment decisions which are different from the decisions our subsidiaries would make if they operated independentlyand could impact the prof
itability and value of these joint ventures. In addition, in the event that a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or isotherwise unable to meet 
its obligations to the joint venture or its share of liabilities at the joint venture, we may be subject to joint and several liability for thesejoint ventures, if and to th
e extent provided for in our governing documents or applicable law.Our renewable energy projects and other initiativ
es face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and regulatory challenges.Wind generation, our solar p
rojects and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. Projects of this nature have beendeveloped through advancemen
t in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which are unrelated to our corebusiness. Some of these business lines 
are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertaintyabout the extent to which such f
avorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future.Furthermore, production lev
els for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in production levelsand profitability. For exa
mple, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studiesconducted by an independent engin
eer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year.As a result, these types of ren
ewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimesexpire or are adverse
ly modified. In addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in generation and utility businesses,there are risks associ
ated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of thenascent nature of these 
industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and theprojects may not perform a
s predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed pricecontracts for the ma
jor cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. Evenwhere available, many of ou
r renewable projects sell power under a Feed-in-Tariff, which may be eliminated or reduced, which can impact the profitability of theseprojects, or make money th
rough the sale of Emission Reductions products, such as Certified Emissions Reductions, Renewable Energy Certificates or RenewableObligation Certificat
es, and the price of these products may be volatile.These projects can be cap
ital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As aresult, these capita
l constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects or obtain third party financing for these projects. These risks may be exacerbatedby the current global econo
mic crisis, including our management's increased focus on liquidity, which may also result in slower growth in the number of projectswe can pursue. The economic downturn cou
ld also impact the value of our assets in these countries and our ability to develop these projects. If the value of theseassets decline, this co
uld result in a material impairment or a series of impairments which are material in the aggregate, which would adversely affect our financialstatements.
Impairment of goodwill or long-lived ass
ets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.As of 
December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately $1.2 billion of goodwill, which represented app roximately 3.1% of the total assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill is no
t amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present.We may be required to ev
aluate the potential impairment of goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we experience situations, including butnot limited to: deterioration i
n general economic conditions, or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; increase in fuel costs,particularly when we are un
able to pass through the impact to customers; negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when weare unable to replac
e it on equally favorable terms; divestiture of a significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. Thesetypes of events and the resul
ting analyses could result in goodwill impairment, which could substantially affect our results of operations for those periods.Additionally, goodwill may be imp
aired if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. See the risk factor Our acquisitions may not perform as expected for further discussion.
Long-lived assets are i
nitially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets are evaluated forimpairment only when impa
irment indicators are present whereas goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if potentialimpairment indicators are present
. Otherwise, the recoverability assessment of long-lived assets is similar to the potential impairment evaluation of goodwillparticularly as it relates to the
 identification of potential impairment indicators, and making estimates and assumptions to determine fair value, as described above.64

Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather.Our businesses are affect
ed by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis ofnormal weather, which repr
esents a long-term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts onour facilities and our bus
inesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally,demand for electri
city peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy islower, resulting in le
ss demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a materialimpact on our results of ope
rations.In addition, we are dependent upon hyd
rological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectricgeneration facili
ties are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, ourresults of operations could b
e materially adversely affected.Information security breaches could harm our business.
A security breach of our info
rmation technology systems or plant control systems used to manage and monitor operations could impact the reliability of ourgeneration fleets and
/or the reliability of our transmission and distribution systems. A security breach that impairs our technology infrastructure could disruptnormal business operations and 
affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution assets, access customer information and limit our communicationswith third parties. Our secur
ity measures may not prevent such security breaches. Any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through a breach couldimpair our reputation, 
expose us to legal claims, or impact our ability to make collections or otherwise impact our operations, and materially adversely affect ourbusiness and results of operat
ions.Our acquisitions may not perform as expected.
Historically, acquisit
ions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. Although acquiredbusinesses may have signific
ant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited orno experience operating 
in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may have been government owned and some may beoperated as part of a l
arger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that:•
we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;•
such businesses will perform as expected;•
integration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected;•
we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;•
such businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to developthem; or
•
the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest capital to acquire them.Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws
Our operations are subject to significant government r
egulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in thelaw or regulatory schemes.
Our ability to predict, in
fluence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any ability to obtain expected or contractedincreases in electricity tariff or co
ntract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meetpublicly announced project
ions or analysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatoryprovisions in jurisdictions wher
e we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affectour business, including, but not lim
ited to:•
changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rates wecharge our customers, inc
luding but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;•
changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utility's operating income or the rates itcharges customers are 
too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;•
changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;•
adverse changes in tax law;65

•changes in law or regulation which limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill theirobligations (including paym
ent obligations) to us or our subsidiaries;•
changes in environmental law which impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities within our subsidiaries;•
changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;•
changes in the timing of tariff increases;•
other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;•
other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or•
other changes that impact the short or long term price-setting mechanism in the markets where we operate.Any of the above events may resul
t in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business.In many countries where we conduc
t business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact of theregulations on our businesses. On July 21, 2010, Presid
ent Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act. While the bulk of regulations contained in the Dodd-Frank Actregulate financia
l institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matterswhich relate to public co
mpanies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company or itsresults of operations. Furthe
rmore, while the Dodd-Frank Act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivativetransactions, the Dodd-Frank Act prov
ides for commercial end-user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions. However, even with theexemption, the Dodd-Frank Act could st
ill have a material adverse impact on the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and marginrequirements for non-exempt
 companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks,which would increase our exposure to 
these risks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, whichcould adversely (1) affect t
he operating results of certain projects; (2) cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated tohedge certain risks, such as p
roject financing agreements; (3) prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; (4) cause theCompany to abandon certain of i
ts hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; (5) and/orconsume substantial liquid
ity by forcing the Company to post cash and/or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. In addition to the Dodd-FrankAct, in 2012, the EMIR became eff
ective. EMIR includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives and the impacts described abovecould also result from our 
(or our subsidiaries') efforts to comply with EMIR. It is also possible that additional similar regulations may be passed in otherjurisdictions where we conduct bus
iness. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Our business in the United States is subject to the provisions of var
ious laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC and NERC,including PURPA, the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC, NERC and by state utility commissions can have a mat
erial effect on ouroperations.
EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the ob
ligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the purchase orsale of electric
ity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilitieslocated within the contro
l areas of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the NYISOand the Electric Reli
ability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC isauthorized under EPAct 2005 to remov
e the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. While this law does not affect existingcontracts, as a result o
f the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long-term contracts expire.EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effec
t of requiring utility holding companies to operate ingeographically proxima
te regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no suchrestrictions and simply p
rovides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. Therepeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to 
mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utilityholding companies. These enti
ties may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the United States generationmarket.
In accordance with Congressiona
l mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electricmarkets. Increased co
mpetition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to developdemand response bidding programs 
as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which relyon very high prices during a re
latively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the66

construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities,they may also increase 
the competition in our existing markets.While the FERC continues to promote 
competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction ofgeneration facilities by traditio
nal utilities to be paid for on a cost-of-service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities inthe competitive wholesa
le generating markets in which we operate.FERC has civil penalty authority ove
r violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as anyrule or order issued ther
eunder. FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. TheFPA also provides for the assessment of 
criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. Withthis expanded enforcemen
t authority, violations of the FPA and FERC's regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.Pursuant to EPAct 2005, the NERC has been certifi
ed by FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to develop mandatory and enforceable electricsystem reliability s
tandards applicable throughout the U.S. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review andapproval. Once approved, the re
liability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizationswith responsibility for audi
ting, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Monetary penalties of up to$1 million per day per viol
ation may be assessed for violations of the reliability standards.Our utility businesses in the U.S. fac
e significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. The regulatory discretion is reasonably broad inboth Indiana and Ohio and includes r
egulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generatingfacilities, the classification of acc
ounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of certain securities, the acquisitionand sale of some public uti
lity properties or securities and certain other matters. These businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action whichcould have a materia
l adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. See Item 1.— Business — US SBU — U.S. Businesses — U.S. Utilities 
for further informa tion on the regulation faced by our U.S. utilities.Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations.
Our businesses are subject to st
ringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties andforeign governmental au
thorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation,remediation of conta
mination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or toobtain or comply with any necess
ary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws andregulations affect
ing power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreigngovernmental authorit
ies have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving airemissions and water discharg
es. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1.— Business of this Form 10-K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and p
roposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurredand will continue to incur sign
ificant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or newdevelopment of, environmen
tal restrictions may force the Company to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be noassurance that we would be able 
to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, includingrecorded asset values or 
results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreignenvironmental laws and regu
lations.Our businesses are subject to enforcement initia
tives from environmental regulatory agencies.The EPA has pursued an enforcement in
itiative against coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and preventionof significant deter
ioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with many of thesecompanies over such alleg
ations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal-fired generating unit without properpermit approval and without 
installing best available control technology. The principal, but not exclusive, focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions ofSO 
2 and NO x . In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution controltechnologies to reduce e
missions of SO 2 and NO x . There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which oursubsidiaries operate will
 not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations.67

Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions andthe potential risks associated with cl
imate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,financial condition and cash flows.
As discussed in Item 1.— 
Business , at the international, federal  and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect and policies are under developmentto regulate GHG emissions, thereby 
effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2015 , the Company's subsidiaries operated busin
esses which had total CO 2 emissions of approximately 67.6 million metric tonnes, approximately 27.4 million of which were emitted bybusinesses located in the U.S. (both f
igures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO 2 emission estimation methodologies supported by "The Greenhouse GasProtocol" reporting standard on GHG emiss
ions. For existing power generation plants, CO 2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuousemission monitoring systems o
r calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO 2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO 2 emissions from fossil fuelelectric power generation facilities
 of the Company's subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits forcommercial opera
tions are approximately 7.8 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based on a number of projections andassumptions which may prove to be in
correct, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO 2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries'achieving completion of su
ch construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completedwill increase emissions o
f our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of GHG emissions. Because there is significant uncertaintyregarding these estim
ates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates.The non-utility, generat
ion subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO 2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there canbe no assurance that such subsidi
aries of the Company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated withany dispute over which party bea
rs such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the Company. The utility subsidiaries of theCompany may seek to pass on any costs ar
ising from CO 2 emissions to customers, but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the Company willeffectively pass such cos
ts to the customers, or that they will be able to fully or timely recover such costs.Foreign, federal, state o
r regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial performance. The actualimpact on the Company's financ
ial performance and the financial performance of the Company's subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including amongothers, the degree and ti
ming of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and theprice and availabil
ity of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receiveGHG emissions allowances without having to pur
chase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability ofour subsidiaries to recove
r costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and couldhave a material adv
erse impact on our results of operations.In January 2005, based on European Community "Di
rective 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading," the EU ETS commencedoperation as the larges
t multi-country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocolrequires all developed 
countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO 2 . However, the United States never ratified theKyoto Protocol and, to date, compli
ance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results ofoperations, financial 
condition and cash flows.In December 2015, the Parties 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ("UNFCCC") convened for the 21st Conference of theParties in Paris, France. The r
esult was the so-called Paris Agreement. We anticipate that the Paris Agreement will continue the trend towards the efforts to de-carbonize the global e
conomy and to further limit GHG emissions, including in those countries where the Company does business. It is difficult to predict thenature, timing and scope of su
ch regulation but it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.In the U.S., there currently is no 
federal legislation imposing a mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including for CO 2 ) affecting the electricpower generation facil
ities of the Company's subsidiaries. However, the EPA has adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new sources ofGHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and ex
isting sources planning physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tonsper year, to obtain new source 
review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. Additionally, the EPA has promulgated a rule establishing NewSource Performance Standards 
for CO 2 emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled EUSGUs larger than 25 MW. The EPA has alsopromulgated a rule, the Cl
ean Power Plan ("CPP"), that requires existing EUSGUs to begin reducing GHG emissions starting in 2022 with the full reductionrequirement in 2030. Under the CPP, stat
es are required to develop and submit plans that establish performance standards or, through emissions trading programs,otherwise meet a stat
e-wide emissions rate average or mass-based goal. For further discussion of the regulation of GHG emission, including the U.S. SupremeCourt's recently issued orders s
taying implementation of the CPP, see Item 1. — 68

Business—Environmental and Land-Use Regulations—United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations—Greenhouse Gas Emissionsabove.
Such regulations, and in parti
cular regulations applying to modified or existing EUSGUs, could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a materialadverse effect on our busin
ess and/or results of operations. See Item 1.— Business of this Form 10-K for further dis cussion about these environmental agreements,laws and regulations.
At the state level, the RGGI, a c
ap-and-trade program covering CO 2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective inJanuary 2009, and California has adop
ted comprehensive legislation and regulation that requires mandatory GHG reductions from several industrial sectors,including the electr
ic power generation industry. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below) and proposed Hawaii regulations relatingto the collection of f
ees on GHG emissions, the impact of both of which we do not expect to be material, the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliancewith United States federal, 
regional or state GHG emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that most of these proposals are not being activelypursued or are in the ear
ly stages of development and any final regulations or laws, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals; in the case ofCalifornia, we anticipa
te no material impact due to the fact that we expect such costs will be passed through to our offtakers under the terms of existing tollingagreements.
The regional auctions of RGGI allowan
ces needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI occurapproximately every qua
rter. Our subsidiary in Maryland is our only subsidiary that was subject to RGGI in 2015 . Of the approximately 27.4 mi llion metric tonnesof CO 
2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2015 (ownership adjusted), approxim ately 1.4 million metric tonnes were emitted by our subsidiary inMaryland. The Company estimat
es that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $3.4 million for 2016 . There is a risk that our a ctual compliance costsunder RGGI will differ from our es
timates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance.In addition to government r
egulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern aboutGHG emissions. For example, certain 
financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which canaffect our ability 
to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. Further, rating agencies may decide to downgrade ourcredit ratings based on th
e emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. Inaddition, plaintiffs hav
e brought tort lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries' GHG emissions. Unless the United States Congress acts to preemptsuch suits as part of compreh
ensive federal legislation, additional lawsuits may be brought against the Company or its subsidiaries in the future. While the litigationmentioned has been dismissed, 
it is impossible to predict whether similar future lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards or other relief.Consequently, it is impossible to d
etermine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operationsand financial condition.
Furthermore, according to 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to,increased runoff and ea
rlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes andvariability in precipitation an
d in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect theCompany's business and operations, and any such po
tential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. For example, extremeweather events could re
sult in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of theCompany's subsidiaries. Variations 
in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. Adecrease in energy consump
tion could decrease the revenues of the Company's subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energyconsumption of customers inc
reased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes andrivers and changes in
 precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of theCompany's subsidiaries. Changes in temp
erature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.In addition to potential phys
ical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the Company andits subsidiaries due to publi
c perception of GHG emissions by the Company's subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimatelyresult in a decreased d
emand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHG emissions made by subsidiaries of the Companyis not a factor in the co
mpensation of executives of the Company.If any of the foregoin
g risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric powergeneration businesses of the Comp
any's subsidiaries and on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.69

Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our subsidiaries have operat
ions in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal,state and local governm
ents and of many non-U.S. jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall taxpositions regarding income o
r other taxes. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these legislativemeasures.
For example, the U.S. is considering co
rporate tax reform that may significantly change U.S. international tax rules and corporate tax rates. Additionally,longstanding internationa
l tax norms that determine how and where cross-border international trade is subjected to tax are evolving. The Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Developm
ent ("OECD"), in coordination with the G8 and G20, recently concluded its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project(“BEPS") with a series of recomm
endations that many tax jurisdictions have adopted, or may adopt in the future, as law. As these and other tax laws, relatedregulations and double-tax 
conventions change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and theirpotential interdepend
ency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for ourearnings and cash flow, but such chang

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We maintain offic
es in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long- and short-term leases, none of which we believe arematerial. With a few exception
s, our facilities, which are described in Item 1 —Business of this Form 10-K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrancesas part of the project's 
related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, in a few instances, noaccompanying project f
inancing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outrightby the subsidiary or affil
iate.ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is involved in certa
in claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company has accrued for litigation and claimswhere it is probable that 
a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes, based upon information itcurrently possesses and taking 
into account established reserves for estimated liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedingsand actions is unlikely to hav
e a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements. It is reasonably possible, however, that some matters could bedecided unfavorably to the Comp
any and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but cannot beestimated as of Decemb
er 31, 2015.In 1989, Centrais Elétricas Br
asileiras S.A. ("Eletrobrás") filed suit in the Fifth District Court in the state of Rio de Janeiro ("FDC") against EletropauloEletricidade de São Paulo S.A. ("EEDSP") rela
ting to the methodology for calculating monetary adjustments under the parties' financing agreement. In April 1999,the FDC found for Eletrobrás and in Septe
mber 2001, Eletrobrás initiated an execution suit in the FDC to collect approximately R$1.8 billion ( $458 million ) from Eletropaulo (as estim
ated by Eletropaulo (or approximately R$2.2 billion ( $571 million )) plus legal costs acco rding to Eletrobrás as of June 2015 and a lesseramount from an unrelat
ed company, Companhia de Transmissão de Energia Elétrica Paulista ("CTEEP") (Eletropaulo and CTEEP were spun off of EEDSPpursuant to its privatiz
ation in 1998). In November 2002, the FDC rejected Eletropaulo's defenses in the execution suit. On appeal, the case was remanded to theFDC for further proceedings to det
ermine whether Eletropaulo is liable for the debt. In December 2012, the FDC issued a decision that Eletropaulo is liable for thedebt. However, that decision was annul
led on appeal and the case was remanded to the FDC for further proceedings. On remand at the FDC, the FDC appointed anaccounting expert to ana
lyze the issues in the case. In September 2015, the expert issued a preliminary report that concluded that Eletropaulo is liable for the debt,without quantifying the debt. El
etropaulo has submitted questions to the expert and reports rebutting the expert's preliminary report. The expert will issue a finalreport in the near futu
re. Thereafter, a decision will be issued by the FDC, which will be free to reject or adopt in whole or in part the expert's70

final report. If the FDC again determines that Eletropaulo is liable for the debt, Eletrobrás will be entitled to resume the execution suit in the FDC. If Eletrobrásdoes so, after the amount of 
the alleged debt is determined, Eletropaulo will be required to provide security for its alleged liability. In that case, if Eletrobrásrequests the seizure of su
ch security and the FDC grants such request, Eletropaulo's results of operations may be materially adversely affected and, in turn, theCompany's results of operations cou
ld be materially adversely affected. In addition, in February 2008, CTEEP filed a lawsuit in the FDC against Eletrobrás andEletropaulo seeking a dec
laration that CTEEP is not liable for any debt under the financing agreement. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to theclaims asserted aga
inst it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.In September 1996, a public civ
il action was asserted against Eletropaulo and Associação Desportiva Cultural Eletropaulo (the "Associação") relating toalleged environmenta
l damage caused by construction of the Associação near Guarapiranga Reservoir. The initial decision that was upheld by the Appellate Courtof the state of São Paulo in 2006 found th
at Eletropaulo should repair the alleged environmental damage by demolishing certain construction and reforesting thearea, and either sponsor an 
environmental project which would cost approximately R$1.8 million ( $461 thousand ) as of December 31, 2015, or pay an indemnification amoun
t of approximately R$15 million ( $4 million ). Eletropaulo has appeal ed this decision to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Courtaffirmed the decis
ion of the Appellate Court. Following the Supreme Court's decision, the case has been remanded to the court of first instance for furtherproceedings and to monitor co
mpliance by the defendants with the terms of the decision. In January 2014, Eletropaulo informed the court that it intended to complywith the court's decision by donat
ing a green area inside a protection zone and restore watersheds, the aggregate cost of which is expected to be approximatelyR$1.8 million 
( $461 thousand ). Eletropaulo also reques ted that the court add the current owner of the land where the Associação facilities are located, EmpresaMetropolitana de Águas e Energ
ia S.A. ("EMAE"), as a party to the lawsuit and order EMAE to perform the demolition and reforestation aspects of the court'sdecision. In July 2014, the court r
equested the Secretary of the Environment for the State of São Paulo to notify the court of its opinion regarding the acceptabilityof the green areas to be don
ated by Eletropaulo to the State of São Paulo. In January 2015, the Secretary of the Environment for the State of São Paulo notifiedEletropaulo and the court 
that it would not accept Eletropaulo's proposed green areas donation. Instead of such green areas donation, the Secretary of theEnvironment proposed in March 2015 th
at Eletropaulo undertake an environmental project to offset the alleged environmental damage. Since March 2015,Eletropaulo and the Secre
tary of Environment have been working together to define an environmental project, which will be submitted for approval by the PublicProsecutor. The cost of such proje
ct is currently estimated to be R$2 million ( $512 thousand ). In December 2001, Gridco Ltd. ("Gridco"
) served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AESOrissa Distribution Private Li
mited ("AES ODPL"), and Jyoti Structures ("Jyoti") pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement between Gridco, theCompany, AES ODPL, Jyoti and the Central Electric
ity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. ("CESCO"), an affiliate of the Company. In the arbitration, Gridcoasserted that a comfo
rt letter issued by the Company in connection with the Company's indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additionalfinancial support to cove
r all of CESCO's financial obligations to Gridco. Gridco appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interes
t, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by Gridco. The Company counterclaimed against Gridco for damages. In June 2007, a 2-to-1 majority of the a
rbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting Gridco's claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, hadany liability to Gridco. The 
respondents' counterclaims were also rejected. A majority of the tribunal later awarded the respondents, including the Company, someof their costs relat
ing to the arbitration. Gridco filed challenges of the tribunal's awards with the local Indian court. Gridco's challenge of the costs award has beendismissed by the court, but its 
challenge of the liability award remains pending. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims assertedagainst it and will defend 
itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.In March 2003, the office of 
the Federal Public Prosecutor for the State of São Paulo, Brazil (“MPF”) notified Eletropaulo that it had commenced an inquiryinto the BNDES financings provided to AES Elpa and AES Transgás, th
e rationing loan provided to Eletropaulo, changes in the control of Eletropaulo, sales ofassets by Eletropaulo, and the qu
ality of service provided by Eletropaulo to its customers. The MPF requested various documents from Eletropaulo relating to thesematters. In July 2004, the MPF filed 
a public civil lawsuit in the Federal Court of São Paulo (“FCSP”) alleging that BNDES violated Law 8429/92 (theAdministrative Misconduct Ac
t) and BNDES's internal rules by (1) approving the AES Elpa and AES Transgás loans; (2) extending the payment terms on the AESElpa and AES Transgás loans; (3) author
izing the sale of Eletropaulo's preferred shares at a stock-market auction; (4) accepting Eletropaulo's preferred shares tosecure the loan provided to E
letropaulo; and (5) allowing the restructurings of Light Serviços de Eletricidade S.A. and Eletropaulo. The MPF also named AES Elpaand AES Transgás as defendants in the l
awsuit because they allegedly benefited from BNDES's alleged violations. In May 2006, the FCSP ruled that the MPFcould pursue its claims bas
ed on the first, second, and fourth alleged violations noted above. The MPF subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal with the FederalCourt of Appeals (“FCA”) seeking to requi
re the FCSP to consider all five alleged violations. In April 2015, the FCA issued a decision holding that the FCSPshould consider all five a
lleged violations. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana (the successor of AES Transgás) have appealed to the Superior Court of Justice. Thelawsuit remains pending befo
re the FCSP, but it will remain suspended until the71

interlocutory appeal has been finally decided. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana believe they have meritorious defenses to the allegations asserted against them andwill defend themselves vigo
rously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts.Pursuant to their environmen
tal audit, AES Sul and AES Florestal discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at a pole factorythat AES Florestal had been opera
ting. The conclusion of the audit was that a prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia ("CEEE"), hadbeen using those contaminants 
to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. On their initiative, AES Sul and AES Florestal communicated with Brazilianauthorities and CEEE about the adop
tion of containment and remediation measures. In March 2008, the State Attorney of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazilfiled a public civil 
action against AES Sul, AES Florestal and CEEE seeking an order requiring the companies to recover the contaminated area located on thegrounds of the pole factory and 
an indemnity payment of approximately R$6 million ( $2 million ) to the state's Environmen tal Fund. In October 2011, the StateAttorney Office filed a 
request for an injunction ordering the defendant companies to contain and remove the contamination immediately. The court grantedinjunctive relief on Oc
tober 18, 2011, but determined only that defendant CEEE was required to proceed with the removal work. In May 2012, CEEE began theremoval work in complianc
e with the injunction. The removal costs are estimated to be approximately R$60 million ( $15 million ) and the work was completed in February 2014. In parallel with 
the removal activities, a court-appointed expert investigation took place, which was concluded in May 2014. The court-appointedexpert final report was p
resented to the State Attorneys in October 2014, and in January 2015 to the defendant companies. In March 2015, AES Sul and AESFlorestal submitted com
ments and supplementary questions regarding the expert report. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claimsasserted against it and wi
ll defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.In March 2009, AES Uruguaiana Empreendim
entos S.A. ("AESU") in Brazil initiated arbitration in the ICC against YPF S.A. ("YPF") seeking damages andother relief rel
ating to YPF's breach of the parties' gas supply agreement ("GSA"). Thereafter, in April 2009, YPF initiated arbitration in the ICC against AESU andtwo unrelated parties, Companh
ia de Gas do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul and Transportador de Gas del Mercosur S.A. ("TGM"), claiming that AESU wrongfullyterminated the GSA and caused th
e termination of a transportation agreement ("TA") between YPF and TGM ("YPF Arbitration"). YPF sought an unspecifiedamount of damages from AESU, a decl
aration that YPF's performance was excused under the GSA due to certain alleged force majeure events, or, in thealternative, a dec
laration that the GSA and the TA should be terminated without a finding of liability against YPF because of the allegedly onerous obligationsimposed on YPF by those agreements. In addi
tion, in the YPF Arbitration, TGM asserted that if it was determined that AESU was responsible for the terminationof the GSA, AESU was liable for TGM's alleged losses, inc
luding losses under the TA. In April 2011, the arbitrations were consolidated into a single proceeding.The hearing on liability 
issues took place in December 2011. In May 2013, the arbitral tribunal issued a liability award in AESU's favor. YPF thereafter challengedthe award in Argentine court. 
In December 2015, an Argentine court issued a decision purporting to annul the liability award. AESU has sought reconsideration ofthat decision. The damages h
earing in the arbitration took place on November 16-17, 2015. The tribunal has not issued a damages award to date. AESU believes ithas meritorious clai
ms and defenses and will assert them vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency in Kazakhs
tan initiated an investigation of certain power sales of Ust-Kamenogorsk HPP ("UK HPP") andShulbinsk HPP, hydroelectric plants under AES conc
ession (collectively, the "Hydros"). The Antimonopoly Agency determined that the Hydros had abused theirmarket position and charg
ed monopolistically high prices for power from January-February 2009. Administrative proceedings followed, but were later suspendeddue to the initiation of 
related criminal proceedings against officials of the Hydros. Recently, the Antimonopoly Agency terminated its investigation of the Hydrosdue to the expiration of th
e relevant statute of limitations.In October 2009, AES Mérida III, S. de R.L. de C.V. ("AES Mérida"), one o
f our businesses in Mexico, initiated arbitration against its fuel supplier andelectricity off
taker, Comisión Federal de Electricidad ("CFE"), seeking a declaration that CFE breached the parties' PPA by supplying gas that did not comply withthe PPA's specifications. Alterna
tively, AES Mérida requested a declaration that the supply of such gas by CFE is a force majeure event under the PPA. CFEdisputed the claims. Although i
t did not assert counterclaims, in its closing brief CFE asserted that it is entitled to a partial refund of the capacity charge paymentsthat it made for power gen
erated with the out-of-specification gas. In July 2012, the arbitral tribunal issued an award in AES Mérida's favor. In December 2012,CFE initiated an action in Mex
ican court seeking to nullify the award. AES Mérida opposed the request and asserted a counterclaim to confirm the award. InFebruary 2014, the court reje
cted CFE's claims and granted AES Mérida's request to confirm the award. CFE has appealed the court's decision. The appeal ispending before the Mexican Supr
eme Court. AES Mérida believes it has meritorious grounds to defeat that action; however, there can be no assurances that it willbe successful.
In October 2009, IPL received a NOV and Finding of Viol
ation from the EPA pursuant to the CAA Section 113(a). The NOV alleges violations of the CAAat IPL's three primarily c
oal-fired electric generating facilities dating back to 1986. The alleged violations primarily pertain to the Prevention of SignificantDeterioration and nonatt
ainment New Source Review72

requirements under the CAA. Since receiving the letter, IPL management has met with EPA staff regarding possible resolutions of the NOV. At this time, wecannot predict the ultimate res
olution of this matter. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of similar cases have required companies to pay civil penalties,install additional pollutio
n control technology on coal-fired electric generating units, retire existing generating units, and invest in additional environmentalprojects. A similar outco
me in this case could have a material impact to IPL and could, in turn, have a material impact on the Company. IPL would seek recoveryof any operating or capit
al expenditures related to air pollution control technology to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that itwould be successful in that reg
ard.In November 2009, April 2010, December 2010, Apri
l 2011, June 2011, August 2011, November 2011, and October 2014, substantially similar personalinjury lawsuits were filed by 
a total of 50 residents and decedent estates in the Dominican Republic against the Company, AES Atlantis, Inc., AES Puerto Rico, LP,AES Puerto Rico, Inc., and AES Puerto Rico Services, Inc., in 
the Superior Court for the state of Delaware. In each lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that the coalcombustion by-products of AES Puerto Rico's power pl
ant were illegally placed in the Dominican Republic from October 2003 through March 2004 andsubsequently caused the plain
tiffs' birth defects, other personal injuries, and/or deaths. The plaintiffs did not quantify their alleged damages, but generally allegedthat they are entit
led to compensatory and punitive damages. The AES defendants moved for partial dismissal of both the November 2009 and April 2010 lawsuitson various grounds. In July 2011, the Superior Court d
ismissed the plaintiffs' international law and punitive damages claims, but held that the plaintiffs had statedintentional tort, negl
igence, and strict liability claims under Dominican law, which the Superior Court found governed the lawsuits. The Superior Court granted theplaintiffs leave to 
amend their complaints in accordance with its decision, and in September 2011, the plaintiffs in the November 2009 and April 2010 lawsuits didso. In November 2011, the AES defendants again 
moved for partial dismissal of those amended complaints, and in both lawsuits, the Superior Court dismissed theplaintiffs' claims 
for future medical monitoring expenses but declined to dismiss their claims under Dominican Republic Law 64-00. The AES defendants filed ananswer to the November 2009 lawsuit in Jun
e 2012. The Superior Court has stayed all lawsuits but the November 2009 lawsuit. In that lawsuit, discovery iscomplete on causation and 
exposure issues, but is ongoing on other liability issues as well as damages issues. Based on the information they have disclosed duringdiscovery, the plaintif
fs in the November 2009 lawsuit appear to be seeking a total of approximately $30 million for life care assistance and lost earnings,additional but unspecifi
ed amounts for moral damages, and additional but unspecified damages for loss of consortium and deaths. Also, in the November 2009lawsuit, trial is schedul
ed for April 2016. The AES defendants believe they have meritorious defenses and will defend themselves vigorously; however, there canbe no assurances that they wil
l be successful in their efforts.On February 11, 2011, Eletropaulo rece
ived a notice of violation from São Paulo State's Environmental Authorities for allegedly destroying 0.32 hectares ofnative vegetation at 
the Conservation Park of Serra do Mar ("Park"), without previous authorization or license. The notice of violation asserted a fine ofapproximately 
R$1 million ( $256 thousand ) and the suspension of Eletropau lo activities in the Park. As a response to this administrative procedure before the SãoPaulo State Environmental Author
ities ("São Paulo EA"), Eletropaulo timely presented its defense on February 28, 2011 seeking to vacate the NOV or reduce thefine. In December 2011, the São Paulo EA de
clined to vacate the NOV but reduced the fine to R$757 thousand ( $194 thousand ) and recognized the possibi lity ofan additional 40% reduct
ion of the fine if Eletropaulo agrees to recover the affected area with additional vegetation. Eletropaulo did not appeal the decision anddiscussed the terms of a possib
le settlement with the São Paulo EA, including a plan to recover the affected area by primarily planting additional trees. In March2012, the state of São Paulo Prosecutor's Of
fice of São Bernardo do Campo initiated a Civil Proceeding to review the compliance by Eletropaulo with the terms ofany possible settlement. Th
e Park Administrator subsequently approved an area for the recovery project different from the affected area, which was no longeravailable. On January 23, 2015, AES Eletropau
lo entered into a Recovery and Compensation Agreement with the Coordenadoria de Fiscaliz a ção Ambiental("CFA") to restore 3.2 hectares dur
ing the course of two years, which restoration is currently estimated to cost R$592 thousand ( $152 thousand ). In June 2015, the state of São Paulo Prosecutor's Offi
ce of São Bernardo do Campo decided to close its Civil Proceeding, subject to the approval of the Superior Counsel of thePublic Prosecutor's Office. Upon compl
etion of the recovery project as approved and established in the Recovery and Compensation Agreement, AES will beentitled to a 40% reduc
tion ( R$303 thousand or $78 thousand ) of the fine as legal ly provided.In June 2011, the São Paulo Municipal Tax Author
ity (the "Tax Authority") filed 60 tax assessments in São Paulo administrative court against Eletropaulo,seeking to collect serv
ices tax ("ISS") that allegedly had not been paid on revenues for services rendered by Eletropaulo. Eletropaulo challenged the assessments onthe ground that the revenues 
at issue were not subject to ISS. In October 2013, the First Instance Administrative Court determined that Eletropaulo was liable forISS, interest, and related p
enalties totaling approximately R$3.3 billion ( $843 million ) as estimated by Eletropa ulo. Eletropaulo thereafter appealed to the SecondInstance Administrativ
e Court ("SIAC"). In January 2016, the Tax Authority reduced the total amount of the ISS assessments to approximately R$228 million ( $58 million 
). The reduced amount of ISS rem ains under consideration by the SIAC. No tax is due while the appeal is pending. Eletropaulo believes it hasmeritorious defenses and wi
ll defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.73

In January 2012, the Brazil Federal Tax Authority issued an assessment alleging that AES Tietê paid PIS and COFINS taxes from 2007 to 2010 at a lowerrate than the tax autho
rity believed was applicable. AES Tietê challenged the assessment on the ground that the tax rate was set in the applicable legislation. InApril 2013, the First Instance Admin
istrative Court determined that AES Tietê should have calculated the taxes at the higher rate and that AES Tietê was liable forunpaid taxes, interest and p
enalties totaling approximately R$910 million ( $233 million ) as estimated by AES Tietê. AES Tiet ê appealed to the Second InstanceAdministrative Court (“SIAC”). In J
anuary 2015, the SIAC issued a decision in AES Tietê's favor, finding that AES Tietê was not liable for unpaid taxes. Thepublic prosecutor subsequently 
filed an appeal, which was denied as untimely. The Tax Authority thereafter filed a motion for clarification of the SIAC's decision,which motion remains pending. AES Tiet
ê believes it has meritorious defenses to the claim and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, therecan be no assurances that i
t will be successful in its efforts.In August 2012, Fondo Patrimonial de las Empr
esas Reformadas (“FONPER”) (the Dominican instrumentality that holds the Dominican Republic's shares inEmpresa Generadora de 
Electricidad Itabo, S.A. (“Itabo”)) filed a criminal complaint against certain current and former employees of AES. The criminalproceedings include a re
lated civil component initiated against, among others, Coastal Itabo, Ltd. (“Coastal”) (the AES affiliate shareholder of Itabo) and NewCaribbean Investment, S.A. (“NC”) (th
e AES affiliate that manages Itabo). FONPER asserts claims relating to the alleged mismanagement of Itabo and seeksapproximately 
$270 million in damages. The D ominican District Attorney (“DA”) thereafter admitted the criminal complaint and requested that the DominicanRepublic's Cámara de Cuentas (“Cá
mara”) perform an audit of the allegations in the criminal complaint. In October 2015, the Cámara issued its final report,determining that the 
contested actions of the AES employees were in accordance with Dominican law. Further, in August 2012, Coastal and NC initiated aninternational arbi
tration proceeding against FONPER and the Dominican Republic (“Respondents”), seeking a declaration that Coastal and NC have acted bothlawfully and in accordanc
e with the relevant contracts with the Respondents in relation to the management of Itabo. Coastal and NC also seek a declaration that thecriminal complain
t is a breach of the relevant contracts between the parties, including the obligation to arbitrate disputes. Coastal and NC further seek damagesfrom the Respondents resulting 
from their breach of contract. The Respondents have denied the claims and challenged the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. InFebruary 2015, the Respondents made an app
lication requesting that the tribunal rule on their jurisdictional objections prior to giving any consideration to themerits of the clai
ms of Coastal and NC. In August 2015, the tribunal rejected the application. The tribunal has established the procedural schedule for thearbitration, but has not ye
t scheduled dates for the final evidentiary hearing. At the parties' request, the Tribunal has suspended the arbitration until July 30, 2016.The AES parties believe they hav
e meritorious claims and defenses, which they will assert vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that they will besuccessful in their efforts.
In July 2015, BTG Pactual (“BTG”) initiat
ed arbitration against AES Tietê under the parties' PPA. BTG claims that AES Tietê breached the PPA bypurchasing more power than it was 
entitled to take under the PPA. BTG seeks to recover the payments that AES Tietê received from its spot-market sales of BTG'spower, totaling approximat
ely R$30 million ( $8 million ). BTG also seeks to terminate the PPA and to collect a termination payment of approximately R$560 million 
( $143 million ). AES Tietê has placed R$30 million ( $8 million ) into escrow, with a full res ervation of rights. AES Tietê has responded to the arbitrationdemand, contesting the cl
aims against it. AES Tietê believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in thisproceeding; however, there 
can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.In September 2015, AES Southland Development, LLC and AES Redondo Beach, LLC fi
led a lawsuit against the California Coastal Commission (the“CCC”) over the CCC's determination tha
t the site of AES Redondo Beach included approximately 5.93 acres of CCC-jurisdictional wetlands. The CCC hasasserted that AES Redondo Beach has improp
erly installed and operated water pumps affecting the alleged wetlands in violation of the California Coastal Act andRedondo Beach Local Coastal Program and h
as ordered AES Redondo Beach to restore the site. Additional potential outcomes of the CCC determination couldinclude an order requir
ing AES Redondo Beach to fund a wetland mitigation project and/or pay fines or penalties. AES Redondo Beach believes that it hasmeritorious arguments 
and intends to vigorously prosecute such lawsuit, but there can be no assurances that it will be successful.In October 2015, Ganadera Guerra, S.A. (“GG”) and Const
ructora Tymsa, S.A. (“CT”) filed separate lawsuits against AES Panama in the local courts ofPanama. The claimants a
llege that AES Panama profited from a hydropower facility (La Estrella) being partially located on land owned first by GG and later byCT, and that AES Panama must pay compensat
ion for its use of the land. The damages sought from AES Panama are approximately $680 million (GG) and $100 million 
(CT). AES Panama believes it has me ritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in the lawsuits; however, there canbe no assurances that it wil
l be successful in its efforts.In January 2015, DPL received NOVs from the EPA alleg
ing violations of opacity at Stuart and Killen Stations, and in October 2015, IPL received a similarNOV alleging violations at Petersbu
rg Station. In February 2016, IPL received an NOV from the EPA alleging violations of NSR and other CAA regulations, theIndiana SIP, and the Title V opera
ting permit at Petersburg Station. It is too early to determine whether the NOVs could have a material impact on our business,financial
74

condition or results of our operations. We would seek recovery of any operating or capital expenditures for IPL, but not fines or penalties, related to air pollutioncontrol technology to reduc

In October 2015, the Company's Board of Direc
tors approved an increase of $400 million to the stock repurchase prog ram (the "Program") under which theCompany can repurchase AES common stock. Th
e Board authorization permits the Company to repurchase stock through a variety of methods, including openmarket repurchases and
/or privately negotiated transactions. There can be no assurances as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases, which may vary basedon market conditions and othe

December 31, 2015 , the Company repurchased 39.7 million shares of its co mmon stock at a total cost of $482 million under the existing stock repurchase program. Th
e cumulative repurchase from the commencement of the Program in July 2010 through December 31, 2015 is 145.6 million shares at a total cost of 
$1.8 billion , at an average price p er share of $12.31 (including a nominal amoun t of commissions).The following table presents

 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSKey Topics in Management's Discussion and Analysis
Our discussion covers the following:
•
Strategic Performance and Overview of 2015 Results •
Review of Consolidated Results of Operations•
SBU Performance Analysis•
Key Trends and Uncertainties•
Capital Resources and LiquidityOverview of 
2015 Results and Strategic Performance In 2015, we faced tough macroecono
mic headwinds, including up to 30% devaluation in some of our key currencies, including the Brazilian Real, ColombianPeso and Euro. We also saw more than 40% d
eclines in oil and natural gas prices, which have an impact on our businesses in the Dominican Republic, Ohio andNorthern Ireland. Additional
ly, Brazil's GDP continued to contract. Despite these continuing challenging conditions, we did what we are good at — adapted to thechanges in circumstanc
es and took actions to mitigate their impact on our businesses and on our financial results. We successfully executed on our strategy andachieved the majori
ty of our objectives by: delivering Proportional Free Cash Flow of $1,241 million , up 39% compared to 2014, and Adjusted EPS of $1.22 ; prudently allocating our
 capital; and advancing select platform expansion projects across our portfolio.Management's Strategic Priorities
Management is focused on the 
following priorities:78

•Reducing complexity: By exiting businesses and markets whe re we do not have a competitive advantage, we are simplifying our portfolio and reducingrisk. During 2015, we announced or closed $787 mi
llion in equity proceeds from the sales or sell-downs of seven businesses.•
Leveraging our platforms: We are focusing our growth on pla tform expansions in markets where we already operate and have a competitive advantage torealize attra
ctive risk-adjusted returns. We currently have 5,620 MW under construction, representing $7 billion in total capital expenditures, with 85% ofAES' $1.2 billion in equity already fund
ed. We expect the majority of these projects to come on-line through 2018. Beyond the projects we currently haveunder construction, we will cont
inue to advance select projects from our development pipeline.•
Performance excellence: We strive to be the low-cos t manager of a portfolio of assets and to derive synergies and scale from our businesses. InNovember, we launched a $150 mill
ion cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative. This initiative will include overhead reductions, procurementefficiencies and ope
rational improvements. We expect to achieve at least $50 million in savings in 2016, ramping up to $150 million, including modestrevenue enhancements, in 2018.
•
Expanding access to capital: We are building strat egic partnerships at the project and business level. Through these partnerships, we aim to optimize ourrisk-adjusted returns in ou
r existing businesses and growth projects. By selling down portions of certain businesses, we can adjust our global exposure tocommodity, fuel, country and o
ther macroeconomic risks. Partial sell-downs of our assets can also serve to highlight or enhance the value of businesses inour portfolio.
•
Allocating capital in a disciplined manner: Our top priority is to maxim ize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, which we achieve by investing ourdiscretionary cash and r
ecycling the capital we receive from asset sales and strategic partnerships. In 2015, we generated substantial cash by executing onour strategy, which we alloca
ted in line with our capital allocation framework:◦
Used $345 million to prepay and refinance Parent debt;◦
returned $757 million to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends;▪
increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, to $0.11 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2016;◦
invested $114 million in our subsidiaries, largely for projects that are currently under construction.2015

(1)
See reconciliation and definition under Non-GAAP Measures.     Diluted earnings per share 
from continuing operations decreased by 60% to $0.44 primarily due to higher impairment expense and lower gains from sales ofbusinesses, partially offs
et by lower debt extinguishment expense.Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, decreased by 
6% to $1.22 primarily due to the dev aluation of foreign currencies in Latin America and Europe, theimpact of lower commodi
ty prices in certain markets, and lower demand in Brazil. These negative impacts were partially offset by a 5% reduction in sharesoutstanding, lower Parent inte
rest expense, improved hydrological conditions in Panama, and contributions from new businesses, including Mong Duong inVietnam.
Net cash provided by operating a
ctivities increased by 19% to $2.1 billion primarily due to the t iming of collections in the Dominican Republic as well asincreases at the Paren
t Company primarily driven by lower interest payments and lower payments for capital expenditures, partially offset by collections on lowermargins resulting from 
economic slowdown, timing of energy purchases and higher interest payments in Brazil.Proportional free cash f
low increased by 39% to $1.2 billion primarily due to the t iming of collections in the Dominican Republic as well as increases at theParent Company primarily dr
iven by lower interest payments and lower payments for maintenance capital expenditures.Safe Operations
Safety is our first value 
and a top priority. We consistently analyze and evaluate our safety performance in order to capture lessons learned and strengthenmitigation plans that impro
ve our safety performance.79

Components of Revenue, Cost of Sales and Operating Margin — 
Revenue includes revenue ea rned from the sale of energy from our utilities and the
production of energy from our generation plants, which are classified as regulated and non-regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively.Revenue also includes the gains o
r losses on derivatives associated with the sale of electricity.Cost of sales includes costs incu
rred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business. Examples include electricity and fuel purchases, O&Mcosts, depreciation and a
mortization expense, bad debt expense and recoveries, general administrative and support costs (including employee-related costs directlyassociated with the opera
tions of the business). Cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreigncurrency embedded derivative
s) associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel.Operating margin is defin
ed as revenue less cost of sales.80

Consolidated Revenue and Operating Margin — Executive Summary(in millions)
Year Ended 
December 31, 2015 Consolidated Revenue 
— Revenue decrease d $2.2 billion , or 13% , to $15.0 billion in 2015 compared to $17.1 billion in 2014 . This decrease was primar ilydriven
 by unfavorable FX  impacts of $2.5  billion ,  primarily in Brazil ($2.2 billion) and Colombia ($179 million). Additionally, there were lower volumes at theUS Utilities, primarily
 at DPL, and outages, milder weather, and lower demand at IPL. Finally, there were lower prices in the Dominican Republic and El Salvador(primarily
 resulting from lower pass-through costs). These decreases were partially offset by higher tariffs at Eletropaulo and Sul (including higher pass-throughcosts), the reversal of 
a contingent regulatory liability at Eletropaulo, higher capacity prices at DPL, and the commencement of principal operations at Mong Duongin April 2015.
Consolidated
 Operating margin — Operating margin decrease d $222 million ,  or 7% , to $2.9 billion in 2015 compared  to $3.1  billion in 2014 .  Thisdecrease
 was driven by unfavorable FX  impacts of $368 million ,  primarily in Brazil ($235 million) and Colombia ($83 million). In addition, Brazil was impactedby
 lower  demand,  lower  hydrology,  and  higher  fixed  costs  and  the  Dominican  Republic  was  impacted  by  lower  commodities  and  lower  availability.  Thesedecreases
 were partially offset by the impact of higher tariffs in Brazil as discussed above, lower spot prices on energy purchases at Tietê, higher generation andlower energy purchases driven by improved hy
drological conditions in Panama, higher prices at Chivor driven by a strong El Niño, and higher availability at Generand Masinloc.
Year Ended December 31, 
2014 Consolidated
 Revenue — Revenue increase d $1.3 billion ,  or 8% , to $17.1 billion in 2014 compared  to $15.9  billion in  2013. This increase was driven byhigher tariffs (pri
marily pass-through costs) at the Brazil Utilities and at IPL, higher spot prices at Tietê, and regulatory retail rate increases at DPL. These increaseswere partially offset by 
unfavorable FX impacts of $752 million , primarily in Brazil ($630 million), Argentina ($69 million) and Colombia ($30 million).Consolidated
 Operating  Margin — Operating margin decrease d $159 million ,  or 5% , to $3.1 billion in 2014 compared  to $3.2  billion in  2013. Thisdecrease
 was driven by unfavorable FX  impacts of $124 million ,  primarily in Brazil ($97 million). In addition, margins were negatively impacted by higher fixedcosts
 at  Eletropaulo,  lower  hydrology  and  higher  spot  purchase  prices  Tietê,  and  lower  availability  at  Kilroot,  Maritza,  and  Masinloc.  These  decreases  werepartially
 offset by higher tariffs and a non-recurring 2013 charge related to the recognition of a contingent regulatory liability at Eletropaulo, and higher generationvolumes and prices at Chivor.

General and administrative expenses
General and administrative e
xpenses include expenses related to corporate staff functions and/or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, humanresources and informat
ion systems, as well as global development costs.General and administra
tive expenses increase d $9 million , or 5% , to $196 million in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to incr eased business development costsand employee-related costs 
partially offset by decreased professional fees.General and administra
tive expenses decrease d $33 million , or 15% , to $187 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to lower em ployee-related costs andbusiness development costs.
81

Interest expenseInterest expense 
decrease d $35 million , or 2% , to $1.4 billion  in 2015 from $1.5 billion in 2014 . The decrease was primarily attribu table to lower interestexpense of $63 million at th
e Parent Company due to a reduction in debt principal, and a $64 million reversal of interest expense previously recognized on acontingent regulatory l
iability at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by an increase at Mong Duong as the plant commenced operations in the firsthalf of 2015 and ceased capi
talizing interest, as well as the impact of the 2014 contingent interest reversal at Sul discussed below.Interest expense 
decrease d $ 11 million , or 1% , to $1.5 billion in 2014 from $1.5 billion in 2013 . This decrease was primarily attribu table to lower interestexpense of $53 million at th
e Parent Company due to a reduction in debt principal, and a $48 million reversal of contingent interest accruals associated withdisputed purchased energy oblig
ations at Sul for which it was determined, based on developments during the second quarter of 2014, that the likelihood of anunfavorable outcome for 
the payment of interest on the disputed obligation was no longer probable. These decreases were partially offset by income of $34 millionin the prior year resul
ting from the ineffectiveness on derivative interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges at Puerto Rico, and higher interest expenseof $24 million at Gener due to 
an increase in debt principal.Interest income
Interest income 
increase d $159 million , or 44% , to $524 million in 2015 from $365 million in 2014 . The increase was primarily due to inte rest income of$114 million recognized in 2015 on 
the financing element of the service concession arrangement at Muong Duong, as well as an increase of $54 million atEletropaulo and Sul resulting 
from higher interest rates and an increase in regulatory assets.Interest income 
increase d $90 million , or 33% , to $365 million in 2014 from $275 million in 2013 . The increase was primarily due to inte rest income of$59 million recognized on FONINVEMEM III re
ceivables in Argentina, which satisfied the criteria for revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well asan increase of $23 mill
ion at Eletropaulo resulting from higher interest rates and an increase in regulatory assets. See Note 7 — Financing Receivables included in Item 8.—

ments for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $26 million , which was primarily rela ted to the sale of our remaining20% interest in Cartagen
a as well as the sale of our 10% equity interest in Trinidad Generation Unlimited. See Note 8 — Investments in and Advances to Affiliates,Note 
16 — Equity, and Note 24 — Dispositions and Held-For-Sale Businesses included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10- K for further information.
Goodwill impairment expense
The Company recognized goodwill imp
airment expense of $317 million , $164 million , and $372 million for the years 82

ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. See Note 10 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
of this Form 10-K for further in formation.Asset impairment expense
The Company recognized asset i
mpairment expense of $285 million , $91 million and $95 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. See Note 
21 — Asset Impairment Expense included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense 
increase d $46 million , or 11% , to $465 million in 2015 . The Company's effective tax rates were 41% and 27% for the years ended December 31, 2015 
and 2014 , respectively. The net 
increase in the 2015 effective tax ra te was due, in part, to the current year nondeductible impairment of goodwill at our U.S. utility, DPL and Chileanwithholding taxes offset by the 
release of valuation allowance at certain of our businesses in Brazil, Vietnam and the U.S. Further, the 2014 rate was impacted bythe items described be
low.Income tax expense 
increase d $76 million , or 22% , to $419 million in 2014 . The Company's effective tax rates were 27% and 33% for the years ended December 31, 
2014 and 2013 , respectively.    The net 
decrease in the 2014 effective tax ra te was due, in part, to the 2014 sale of approximately 45% of the Company's interest in Masin AES Pte Ltd.,which owns the Company's business interests in 
the Philippines, and the 2014 sale of the Company's interests in four U.K. wind operating projects. Neither of thesetransactions gave rise 
to income tax expense. Further, the 2014 effective tax rate benefited from the release of valuation allowance against U.S. capital losscarryforwards and a change 
in tax status at a subsidiary operating in the Dominican Republic. Offsetting these items is the unfavorable impact of Chilean incometax law reform enact
ed in the third quarter of 2014. See Note 16 — Equity for additional inform ation regarding the sale of approximately 45% of the Company'sinterest in Masin-AES Pte Ltd. See Note 
24 — Dispositions and Held-for-Sale Businesses for additional inform ation regarding the sale of the Company's interestsin four U.K wind operating projects.
Our effective tax ra
te reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of35%. A future proportionate ch
ange in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodiceffective tax rate. The Com
pany also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment andcapital investment. Se

Other non-operating expense was 
zero , $128 million and $129 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. See Note 9 —Other Non-Operating Expense

a discussed below.84

Net equity in earnings of affiliates decrease d $6 million to $19 million in 2014 from $25 million in 2013 . The decrease was primarily a result o f an assetimpairment charge 
at Elsta due to long lived assets that were determined to not be recoverable of which our share was $41 million. These items were partiallyoffset by a $22 million lower 
loss recognized at Entek on an embedded foreign currency derivative and a $19 million increase as a result of the sale of equityinterests in SRP. See Note

Non-GAAP Measures
Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC, Adjusted EPS, and Proport
ional Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are used bymanagement and extern
al users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders.Adjusted Operating Margin 
— Operating Margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales. Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses inthe ordinary course of business, su
ch as Electricity and fuel purchases; O&M costs; Depreciation and amortization expense; Bad debt expense & recoveries;General administrat
ive & support costs at the businesses; and Gains or losses on derivatives associated with the purchase and sale of electricity or fuel.We define Adjusted Operating M
argin as Operating Margin, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests, excluding85

unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions.The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjus
ted Operating Margin is Operating Margin. We believe that Adjusted Operating Margin better reflects theunderlying business performan
ce of the Company. Factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests, where AES consolidates the resultsof a subsidiary that is not wholly
-owned by the Company, as well as the variability due to unrealized derivatives gains or losses. Adjusted Operating Margin shouldnot be construed as an alte
rnative to Operating Margin, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS 
— We define Adjusted PTC as pretax in come from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excludinggains or losses due to (a) unre
alized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due todispositions and acquisitions of bus
iness interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt.Adjusted PTC reflects the impa
ct of noncontrolling interests and excludes the items specified in the definition above. In addition to the revenue and cost ofsales reflected in Ope
rating Margin, Adjusted PTC includes the other components of our income statement, such as General and administrative expense in thecorporate segment, as wel
l as business development costs; Interest expense and interest income; Other expense and other income; Realized foreign currencytransaction gains and losses
; and Net equity in earnings of affiliates.We define Adjusted EPS as diluted e
arnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related toderivative transac
tions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due toimpairments, and (e) 
costs due to the early retirement of debt.The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjus
ted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation. The GAAP measure mostcomparable to Adjusted EPS is dilut
ed earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect theunderlying business performan
ce of the Company and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determinationinclude the variabil
ity due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments andstrategic decisions to d
ispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earningsbefore tax represents 
the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of taxplanning, corresponding to the va
rious jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives toincome from continuing ope
rations attributable to The AES Corporation and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined inaccordance with GAAP.

Key Trends and Uncertainties
During 
2016 and beyond, we expect to face th e following challenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improved operating performanceat certain businesses, growth 
from new businesses and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If these favorable effects do not occur, orif the challenges described
 below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies andcommodities move more un
favorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our operating margin, net incomeattributable to The AES Corporat
ion and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to ourbusiness, see Item 1.— 
Business and Item 1A.— Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Operational
Sensitivity to Dry Hydrologica
l Conditions — Our hydroelectric gener ation facilities are sensitive to changes in the weather, particularly the level of waterinflows into generation fa
cilities. Since 2013, dry hydrological conditions in Panama, Brazil, Colombia and Chile have presented challenges for our businesses inthese markets. Low rainfa
ll and water inflows have caused reservoir levels to be below historical levels, reduced generation output, and increased prices forelectricity. If hydrological co
nditions do not improve and our hydroelectric generation facilities cannot generate sufficient energy to meet contractual arrangements,we may need to purchase energy 
to fulfill our obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.According to the National Ocean
ic and Atmospheric Administration ("NOAA") a strong El Niño has been declared and is forecasted through the spring of2016. According to local hydrologic
al forecasts in Panama, below historical average inflows are expected to persist through the dry season of 2016 (ending inApril). The effects of th
e El Niño phenomena could potentially intensify the dry hydrology conditions during this period. AES Panama has to purchase energy onthe spot market to fulf
ill its contract obligations when its generation output is below contract levels. However, with declines in oil prices the cost of purchasingreplacement power is r
educed. In addition, lower hydrology results in less energy available to sell in the spot market after fulfilling contract obligations. We expectthis trend to continue through 
the dry season of 2016, which will continue to impact our results of operations.The El Niño brought some relief 
to the dry conditions in Brazil as it brought rain to the South and Southeast regions. The Southeast region has a significantportion of the country's rese
rvoir capacity. At the beginning of 2016, we expect the system operator in Brazil to continue to pursue a more conservative reservoirmanagement strategy 
to recover the reservoirs. Higher inflows are expected along with an impact on reservoir level recovery and lower spot prices. AES Sul, whichis in the South of Brazil, could be n
egatively impacted by higher hydrology causing floods and other damage which could disrupt service and require emergencyrepairs. Additionally, highe
r hydrology could reduce the need for demand to provide irrigation services during the warm season.Impacts in Colombia are un
certain since it will depend strongly upon the behavior pattern of the El Niño and can lead to better hydrology for just the areawhere our plant, Chivor, is locat
ed or the country as a whole. More extreme behavior can have an opposite impact and leave the Chivor basin dryer but theremainder of the count
ry with better hydrology.In the case of Chile, the hydro
logical year starts in April, and given that the El Niño phenomenon is not highly correlated with hydrological conditions inChile, projection are m
ade considering the average of all hydrological conditions. For the first quarter 2016, projections are made considering 2015 snowpackinformation which shows hydrologica
l condition lower than average.The exact behavior patt
ern and strength of El Niño cannot be definitively known at this time and therefore the impacts could vary from those describedabove. Even if rainfall 
and water inflows return to historical averages, in some cases high market prices and low generation could persist until reservoir levels arefully recovered.
Macroeconomic and Political
During the past few years, econom
ic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Global economic conditionsremain volatile and 
could have an adverse impact on our businesses in the event these96

recent trends continue.Brazil 
— In Brazil, economic condi tions remain unfavorable, as indicated by such factors as a negative GDP growth for 2015 and expectation for the same in2016 and flat for 2017, higher int
erest rates and inflation, and increasing unemployment. As a consequence, our distribution businesses have experienced a declinein demand. If these econom
ic conditions persist or worsen, there could be a material impact on our businesses and AES's results of operations, particularly in ourdistribution businesses in Braz
il, AES Sul and AES Eletropaulo.In the case of AES Sul, at December 31, 2015, d
ebt in the amount of $333 million is classified as current d ue to a failure to meet required debt covenantsrelated to earnings fo
r two consecutive quarters. This default is primarily due to the economic conditions noted above, an increase in regulatory assets due to sectorcharges and higher priced 
energy purchases, increase in delinquency rates, and higher costs due to unfavorable hydrology in Brazil and severe weather conditions,particularly in AES Sul's servic
e area. AES Sul is in negotiations with its creditors and has obtained a waiver for a period of two months, that ends in February2016, when the Company expects to close th
e renegotiation of the whole debt, involving extending the debt maturities and additional equity contributions ofapproximately $75 mill
ion. Following the debt renegotiations, the Company will assess all strategic alternatives for AES Sul. If the negotiation is unsuccessful,we may face a loss of earn
ings and/or cash flows from Sul and may have to provide loans or equity to support the business, and/or restructure the business, any ofwhich could have a materi
al impact on the Company. In addition, AES Sul has recorded net deferred tax assets ("DTA") of $133 million relating primarily to net operating loss carryforwa
rds, which are not subject to expiration. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income. Although realization is notassured, management bel
ieves it is more likely than not that all of the DTA will be realized. The amount of DTA that is considered realizable, however, could bereduced in the near term if e
stimates of future taxable income are reduced. Argentina 
—  In  November  2015,  Argentina  held  presidential  elections  in  which  centrist  candidate  Mauricio  Macri  was  elected  president.  During  hiscampaign, Mauricio Macri emphasized that energy would be
 a key factor in the government's agenda and that a long-term state policy would be required to addressthe
 country's  energy  crisis.  Also,  the  elected  President  signed,  together  with  the  opposition  candidates,  a  statement  of  commitment  addressed  to  the  previousadministration, that included
 several guidelines to reactivate the sector including the implementation of a strategic long-term energy plan, that a fair and reasonablecustomer tariffs be s
et for generation, transport and distribution costs, as well as reductions in subsidies and the introduction of a social tariff.In
 line with these statements, the Energy and Mining Minister published Resolution 6/2016 and 7/2016 in January 2016 that outlines planned increases to theend
 consumers of energy that will be effective starting on February 1, 2016. These resolutions contemplate an increase in tariffs of up to 300% for energy pass-through,
 grant  Distribution  Value  Added  ("DVA")  increases  for  Distribution  Companies,  provide  a  regulatory  framework  for  an  Integral  Tariff  Review  andintroduce subsidies for low inco
me consumers. These increases are intended to lessen the burden on the government to subsidize the energy industry.In 2001, Argentina defaulted on i
ts public debt, when it stopped making payments of approximately $100 billion of debt amid a deep economic crisis. In 2005and 2010, Argentina restructur
ed its defaulted bonds into new securities valued at about 33 cents on the dollar. Between the two transactions, 93% of thebondholders agreed to exchange 
their defaulted bonds for new bonds. The remaining 7% did not accept the restructured deal. Since then, a certain group of the"hold-out" bondholders have been in jud
icial proceedings with Argentina regarding payment and the U.S. District Court ruled that Argentina would need to makepayments to such hold-out bondholders 
according to the original applicable terms. Despite intense negotiations with the hold-out bondholders through the U.S.District Court appointed Speci
al Master, on July 30, 2014 the parties failed to reach a settlement agreement and consequently (as referred by S&P and Fitchratings) Argentina fel
l into a selective default resulting from failure to make interest payments on its Discount Bonds maturing in December 2033. The newadministration star
ted conversations to negotiate a solution with the bondholders which could resolve this situation and let Argentina return to the credit markets inthe near future. Although this s
ituation remains unresolved, it has not caused any significant changes that impact our current exposures, and the long-termreceivables in Argentin
a for the plants that commenced commercial operations in 2010 are being actively collected. For further information, see Note 7 —Financing Receivables 
in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the 2015 Form 10-K. Bulgaria 
— Our investments in Bulgaria r ely on long-term PPAs with NEK, the state-owned electricity public supplier and energy trading company. NEK isfacing some liquidity issu
es and has been delayed in making payments under the PPAs with Maritza and St. Nikola. In August 2015, the ninth amendment ofMaritza's PPA was executed under which Ma
ritza and NEK would reduce the capacity payment to Maritza under the PPA by 14% through the PPA Term, withoutimpacting the energy pr
ice component. In exchange, NEK would pay Maritza its overdue receivables. The amendment will become effective upon full payment ofthe overdue receivabl
es by NEK, which is expected in 2016. For the period October through December 2015, NEK paid a total of $64 million, which is $16 millionmore than payments rec
eived in the previous year. As of December 31, 2015, Maritza's total outstanding receivables were $351 million , of which $44 million were current and $307 million wer
e overdue. Total receivables increased by $89 million from $262 million in December 31, 2014. See additiona l background withinPart I.—Item 1— 
Business — Our Organization and Segments — Europe — Bulgaria — Regulatory Framework.97

As of June 30, 2015, we concluded that the HTA signed with NEK in April is considered an indicator of an impairment of the long-lived assets in Bulgariafor Maritza. Therefo
re, a test of recoverability was performed and management believes the carrying amount of the asset groups was recoverable as of June 30,2015. Management does not believ
e that an indicator of an impairment existed as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, Maritza had long-lived assetsof $1.2 billion and total debt o
f $559 million . Long-lived assets for St. Nikola wer e $210 million and total debt of $140 million . Unless and until a complete 
and binding resolution is in place, there remains a risk that we may still face a loss of earnings and/or cash flows from theaffected businesses (or b
e unable to exercise remedies for a breach of the PPA) and may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects,restructure them, wri
te down their value and/or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with ourexpectations, any of which could h
ave a material impact on the Company.Puerto Rico 
— Our subsidiaries in Puerto Rico have long term PPAs with PREPA, a state-owned entity. Due to the ongoing economic situation in thecountry, PREPA faces significant fin
ancial challenges.On June 28, 2014, the Puerto Rico Public Corporation Debt En
forcement and Recovery Act (the "Recovery Act") was signed into law, which allows publiccorporations, including PREPA, to adjust the
ir debts. As a result of this event, on July 6, 2014, PREPA entered into a Forbearance Agreement with its lenders inorder to permit an opportun
ity for negotiation of a possible financial restructuring of PREPA. In February 2015, the negotiating position of PREPA was weakenedwhen the federal court de
emed the Recovery Act unconstitutional. Despite this setback, PREPA managed to extend the expiration of the Forbearance Agreementseveral times, achi
eving in December of 2015 certain preliminary restructuring agreements, called Restructuring Support Agreements ("RSAs"), with most of thebondholders and bank lenders, which involv
ed reductions of capital and interest rates and options to either convert existing credits to term loans or to exchangetheir principal for n
ew securitized bonds. The RSA is conditional to a series of future related milestones, the more important being the passing of a bill that wouldallow an increase in tariffs.
There has been no adverse imp
acts to AES Puerto Rico due to PREPA's financial challenges. AES Puerto Rico's receivables balance as of December 31, 2015 is 
$65 million , of which $21 million was overdue. Subsequent to December 31, 2015 , the full overdue amount has b een collected. If the situation declines, therecould be a material 
impact on the Company.Macroeconomic and Political 
— Conclusion If economic conditions deteriorate further, it could affect the prices we receive for the electricity we generate ortransmit. Utility regu
lators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our prices based on prevailing market conditions pursuant to PPAs, concessionagreements or other con
tracts as they come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual price or tariff decreases couldrestrict our abili
ty to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assetsincluding those at the business
es we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material toour operations. We continue 
to monitor our projects and businesses.Foreign Exchange and Commodities
Our businesses are
 exposed to and proactively manage market risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities, particularly electricity,oil, natural gas, coal and 
environmental credits. In 2015, there were more than 40% declines in oil and natural gas prices, which have an impact on our businessesin the Dominican Republic, Ohio and North
ern Ireland. Since we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varyingdegrees at the subsidiary 
level and between our functional currency, the U.S. Dollar, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. In 2015, we hadsignificant devaluat
ions in the Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, and Kazakhstan Tenge, which had a significant impact on our 2015 results. In2016, our results could be mate
rially impacted if the U.S. Dollar continues to appreciate. For additional information, refer to Item 7A.— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Mark
et Risk.Impairments
Long-lived Assets 
— During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company recognized asset impairments of $285 million . See Note 21 — AssetImpairment Expense 
in this Form 10-K for further in formation.Additionally, in the third qua
rter of 2015, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland and Buffalo GapI and II. Impairment 
indicators were identified at Ballylumford, primarily based on an unfavorable capacity reduction proposed by the Utility regulator in NorthernIreland, and at Buffalo Gap, bas
ed on a decline in forward power curves coupled with the near term expiration of favorable contracted cash flows. As of September30, 2015, the Company determined tha
t the carrying amount of the long-lived asset groups at Ballylumford and Buffalo Gap I and II, which totaled $92 million and$371 million, respective
ly, were recoverable, and no impairment expense was recognized. Buffalo Gap98

I and II have PPAs that will expire at the end of 2021 and 2017, respectively. Once the PPAs expire, the entire installed capacity of Buffalo Gap will be exposed tothe volatility of ene
rgy prices in the ERCOT market which could adversely affect revenues. No impairment indicators were identified in the fourth quarter of 2015.Events or changes i
n circumstances that may necessitate further recoverability tests and potential impairments of long-lived assets may include, but are notlimited to, adverse ch
anges in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity inthe grid, technological 
advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation that it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the endof its previously estima
ted useful life.Goodwill 
— During 2015 , the Company recognized tota l goodwill impairment expense of $317 million , which resulted from the annu al goodwillimpairment test pe
rformed in the fourth quarter of 2015 at its DP&L reporting unit ("DP&L"). As of December 31, 2015 , there was no remaining goodwill b alanceat DP&L. See Note 
10 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. The Company currently has no repor
ting units considered to be "at risk." A reporting unit is considered " at risk" when its fair value is not higher than itscarrying amount by more th
an 10%. The Company monitors its reporting units at risk of Step 1 failure on an ongoing basis. It is possible that the Company mayincur goodwill impairmen
t charges at any reporting units containing goodwill in future periods if adverse changes in their business or operating environmentsoccur.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Overview — 
As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion , of which $400 million was held at the Parent Company and qualified hold
ing companies. The Company also had $484 million in short term investmen ts, held primarily at subsidiaries. In addition, wehad restricted cash and d
ebt service reserves of $860 million . The Company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of$15.8 billion 
and $5.0 billion , respectively. Of the approx imately $2.5 billion of our current non-recours e debt, $1.5 billion was presented as such because i t is duein the next twelve months and 
$1.0 billion relates to debt conside red in default due to covenant violations. The defaults are not payment defaults, but are insteadtechnical defaults 
triggered by failure to comply with other covenants and/or other conditions such as (but not limited to) failure to meet information covenants,complete construction or 
other milestones in an allocated time, meet certain minimum or maximum financial ratios, or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents of 
the Company.We expect such current 
maturities will be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates or throughopportunistic refinanc
ing activity or some combination thereof. None of our recourse debt matu res within the next twelve months. From time to time, we may electto repurchase our outstanding d
ebt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes that such securities areattractively pri
ced. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved inany such repurchases may be m
aterial.We rely mainly on long-term
 debt obligations to fund our construction activities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recoursedebt to fund a significant po
rtion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies andrelated assets. Our non-re
course financing is designed to limit cross default risk to the Parent Company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse long-term debt is a combina
tion of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Generally, a portion or all of the variable rate debt is fixed through the use of interest rateswaps. In addition, the debt is typi
cally denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project,thereby reducing curren
cy risk. In certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our non-recourse debt is fundedby international comm
ercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks.Given our long-term debt oblig
ations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. When possible, theCompany will borrow funds at fixed int
erest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition, the Company hashistorically tried to maintain at
 least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interestrate swaps. These efforts app
ly to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company's onlymaterial un-hedged exposu
re to variable interest rate debt relates to indebtedness under its senior secured credit facility and floating rate senior unsecured notes due2019. On a consolidated basis, of the Company's 
$15.8 billion of total non-recourse deb t outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , approximately $3.8 billion bore interest at variable rates that 
were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate.In addition to utilizing non
-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of theremaining long-term financing
 or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investments have generally takenthe form of equity invest
ments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. We generally obtain the funds for theseinvestments from our cash 
flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and othersecurities. Similar
ly, in certain of our businesses, the Parent Company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterpartieswho have entered into contra
cts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if abusiness defaults on its paymen
t or supply obligation, the Parent Company will be responsible for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in therelevant guarantee o
r other credit support. At December 31, 2015 , the Parent Company had provided outst anding financial and performance-related guarantees orother credit support com
mitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $396 million in aggregate (excluding thos
e collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below).As a result of the Parent Company's be
low investment grade rating, counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to providecredit support. Accordingly, with 
respect to both new and existing commitments, the Parent Company may be required to provide some other form of assurance,such as a letter of cr
edit, to backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. Tothe extent we are requi
red and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meetour other liquidity needs. At 
December 31, 2015 , we had $62 million in letters of credi t outstanding, provided under our senior secured credit facility, and $32 million 
in cash collateral ized letters of credit outstanding outside of99

our senior secured credit facility. These letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and business operations.During the year ended 
December 31, 2015 , the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 0.2% to 2.5%  per annum on the outstanding amoun ts.We expect to continue to s
eek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop,construct or acquire. However, d
epending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may notbe available on economi
cally attractive terms or at all. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is underconstruction or has near-
term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent,and we may lose our investment 
in that subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from aproject or restructu
re the non-recourse debt financing. If we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete arestructuring of the non-
recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary.Many of our subsidiaries depend on t
imely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorableterms, to refinance existing
 indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverseeffects on the financ
ial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatorydeterminations under th
e relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses.Long-Term Receivables — 
As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately $296 million and $63 million of accounts receivabl e classified asNoncurrent assets—other 
and Current assets—Accounts receivable , respectively, rela ted to certain of its generation businesses in Argentina and the U.S. and itsutility businesses in Brazi
l. The noncurrent portion primarily consists of accounts receivable in Argentina that, pursuant to amended agreements or governmentresolutions, have collec
tion periods that extend beyond December 31, 2016 , or one year from the la test balance sheet date. The majority of Argentinian receivableshave been converted into long
-term financing for the construction of power plants. See Note 7 — Financing Receivables included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
and Item 1.— Business — Regulatory Matters—Argentina of this Form 10-K for further in formation.Consolidated Cash Flows

Proportional Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP measure)We define proportional 
free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverableenvironmental capit
al expenditures), adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests. The proportionate share of cash flows and related adjustmentsattributable to noncont
rolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation below. Upon the Company'sadoption of the accounting guid
ance for service concession arrangements effective January 1, 2015, capital expenditures related to service concession assets thatwould have been classified as 
investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are now classified as operating activities. See Note 1 —General and Summary of Significant Accounting Poli
cies of this Form 10-K for further in formation on the adoption of this guidance.Beginning in the quarter ended M
arch 31, 2015, the Company changed the definition of Proportional Free Cash Flow to exclude the cash flows for capitalexpenditures related 
to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of CashFlows. The proportional adjustment 
factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below.We also exclude environm
ental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory, contractual or other mechanisms. An example ofrecoverable environmental capital e
xpenditures is IPL's investment in MATS-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker. See Item 1. — US SBU—IPL—Environmental Matters 
for details of these inv estments.The GAAP measure most comparable to p
roportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities. We believe that proportional free cash flow betterreflects the underly
ing business performance of the Company, as it measures the cash generated by the business, after the funding of maintenance capitalexpenditures, that may be 
available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes. Factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests,where AES consolidates the results o
f a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company.The presentation of fre
e cash flow has material limitations. Proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operatingactivities, which is det
ermined in accordance with GAAP. Proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary paymentsbecause it excludes ce
rtain payments that are required or to which we have committed, such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition ofproportional free cash flo
w may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.Calculation of Proportional Free Cash Flow (in millions)

 Service concession asset expenditures excluded from proportional free cash flow non-GAAP metric.(2) 
 The proportional adjustment factor, proportional maintenance capital expenditures (net of reinsurance proceeds) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentageowned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and 
are totaled to the resulting figures. For example, Parent Company A owns 20% of Subsidiary Company B, a consolidatedsubsidiary. Thus, Subsidiary Company B has an 80% noncontrolling interest. Assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $100 from Subsidiary B, the proportional adjustment fa
ctor for Subsidiary B wouldequal $80 (or $100 x 80%). The Company calculates the proportional adjustment f
actor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in thereconciliation. The proportional adjustment factor may differ from th
e proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of (a) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and (b) AES' ownershipinterest in the subsidiary where such items occur.

The Company defines Parent Free Cash Flow as div
idends and other distributions received from our operating businesses less certain cash costs at the ParentCompany level, primarily 
interest payments, overhead, and development costs. Parent Free Cash Flow is used to fund shareholder dividends, share repurchases,growth investments, recourse d
ebt repayments, and other uses by the Parent Company. Refer to Item 1— Business — Overview for further discussion of th e ParentCompany's capital alloca
tion strategy.Parent Company Liquidity
The following discussion of Parent Company L
iquidity has been included because we believe it is a useful measure of the liquidity available to The AESCorporation, or the Parent Company, giv
en the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company Liquidity as outlined below is a non-GAAPmeasure and should not be constru
ed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents which are determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of liquidity.Cash and cash equivalents are d
isclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Parent Company Liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used byother companies. The princ
ipal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancingproceeds; proceeds from d
ebt and equity financings at the Parent Company level, including availability under our credit facility; and proceeds from asset sales.Cash requirements at the
 Parent Company level are primarily to fund interest; principal repayments of debt; construction commitments; other equity commitments;common stock repurchases; 
acquisitions; taxes; Parent Company overhead and development costs; and dividends on common stock.
110
The Company defines Parent Company Liquidity as cash available to the Parent Company plus available borrowings under existing credit facility. The cashheld at qualified holding 
companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S.. Such subsidiaries have no contractualrestrictions on their 
ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company Liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financialmeasure, 
Cash and cash equivalents , at December 31, 2015 and 2014 as follows: Parent Company Liquidity (in millions)

eve we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, or if continued, theamount of such dividends.
Recourse Debt 
— Our recourse debt at year -end was approximately $5.0 billion and $5.3 billion in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. See Note 12 — Debt in Item 8.— 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional d etail.While we believe that ou
r sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of materialassumptions, including, without li
mitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets (see Key Trends and Uncertainties — Global EconomicConditions 
), the operating and finan cial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries topay dividends. In addition, our subsidi
aries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations containedin loans, governmental provis
ions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cashrequirements will not be g
reater than anticipated. See Item 1A.— Risk Factors — The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments onits outstanding indebtedness, inc
luding its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest,loans or otherwise, 
of this Form 10-K. Various debt instruments at 
the Parent Company level, including our senior secured credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. The covenantsprovide for — among other it
ems — limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and otherequity transactions; r
estrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivativearrangements; maintenance of certain
 financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements.As of December 31, 
2015 , we were in compliance with th ese covenants at the Parent Company level.Non-Recourse Debt 
— While the lenders under ou r non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, defaultsthereunder can still h
ave important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation:•
reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the time period of any default;•
triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of suchsubsidiary;
•
causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and•
triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company.For example, our senior secur
ed credit facility and outstanding debt securities at the Parent Company include events of default for certain bankruptcy relatedevents involving materi
al subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the Parent Company includes events of default related to payment defaults andaccelerations of outs
tanding debt of material subsidiaries.Some of our subsidiaries are 
currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total non-recourse debt classified ascurrent in the accomp
anying Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts to $2.5 billion . The portion of current debt related to such defaults was $1.0 billion  at December 31, 2015 
, all of which was non-recourse deb t related to four subsidiaries — Maritza, Sul, Kavarna, and Sogrinsk. See Note 12 — Debt in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
of this Form 10-K for additional d etail.None of the sub
sidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under AES' corporate debt agreements asof 
December 31, 2015 in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under AES' indebtedness. However, as a result of additionaldispositions of assets, other sign
ificant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results ofoperations or the financ
ial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a "materialsubsidiary" and thereby upon an ac
celeration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the Parent Company's outstanding debtsecurities. A materi
al subsidiary is defined in the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility as any business that contributed 20% or more of the ParentCompany's total cash distribut
ions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2015 , none of the defaults list edabove individually or in the 
aggregate results in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the Company.111

rs of credit disclosed above.We have a diverse portfo
lio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. These obligations are designed to cover potential risks and onlyrequire payment if c
ertain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. The risks associated with these obligations include change of control, constructioncost overruns, subsidiary defau
lt, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidated damages under power sales agreementsfor projects in developm
ent, in operation and under construction. In addition, we have an asset sale program through which we may have customary indemnityobligations under certa
in assets sale agreements. While we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractualobligations beyond 
2015 , many of the events which would give r ise to such obligations are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will be ableto fund our obligations under thes

Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe Consolidated Financial Stat
ements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptionsthat affect the r
eported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periodspresented. AES' significant ac
counting policies are described in Note  1 — General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in I
tem 8 of this Form 10-K.An accounting estimate i
s considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the timethe estimate was made; different
 estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operatingperformance is material.
Management believes that the
 accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results couldmaterially differ from the original e
stimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policieswith the Audit Committee, as app
ropriate. Listed below are the Company's most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation ofthe Consolidated Financial Sta
tements.Income Taxes 
— We are subject to inco me taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requiressignificant judgment and 
is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. TheCompany and certain of its subsid
iaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potentialoutcome of these examin
ations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty inincome taxes prescrib
es a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation tothe potential for addi
tional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occursnecessitating a change 
to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome ofcurrent or future examination
s may be materially different than the reserve amounts.Because we have a wide range of st
atutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix couldmaterially impa
ct our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or theinterpretation or enforcement there
of and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictionsin which we operate. As an example, n
ew tax laws were enacted in February 2016 in Chile which will increase the statutory income tax rate for most of our Chileanbusinesses from 25% to 25.5% in 2017 and to 27
% for 2018 and future years. Accordingly, in 2016 our net Chilean deferred tax liabilities will be remeasured to thenew rates. The remeasure
ment amount and other potential future impacts of the changes in tax law may be material to continuing operations.The Company's provision for income t
axes could be adversely impacted by changes to the U.S. taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Since 2006,the Company has benefited fro
m the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through rule, originally enacted in the TIPRA of 2005, subject to five temporaryextensions, including the most 
recent five year retroactive extension enacted on December 18, 2015 in the H.R.2029 - Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016.There can be no assurance th
at this provision will continue to be extended beyond December 31, 2019. Further, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform thatmay significantly chang
e the U.S. international tax rules and corporate tax rates. Our expected effective tax rate could increase by amounts that may be material tothe Company should such reforms be en
acted.In addition, U.S. income taxes and fo
reign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to theextent such earnings are 
considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.Deferred tax assets and
 liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amountsof the existing assets and l
iabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that allor a portion of a deferr
ed tax asset will not be realized.Sales of Noncontrolling Interests 
— The accounting for a sale o f noncontrolling interests under the accounting standards depends on whether the sale isconsidered to be a sale of 
in-substance real estate (as opposed to an equity transaction), where the gain (loss) on sale would be recognized in earnings rather thanwithin stockholders' equity. If 
management's estimation process determines that there is no significant value beyond the in-substance real estate, the gain (loss) onthe sale of the noncontrol
ling interest is recognized in earnings. However, if it is determined that significant value likely exists beyond the in-substance real estate,the gain (loss) on the sale o
f the noncontrolling interest would be recognized within stockholders' equity. In-substance real estate is comprised of land plusimprovements and integr
al equipment. The determination of whether property, plant and equipment is integral equipment is based on the significance of the coststo remove the equipment fr
om its existing location (including the cost of repairing damage resulting from the removal), combined with the decrease in the fair113

value of the equipment as a result of those removal activities. When the combined total of removal costs and the decrease in fair value of the equipment exceeds10% of the fair value of 
the equipment, the equipment is considered integral equipment. The accounting standards specifically identify power plants as an exampleof in-substance real es
tate. Where the consolidated entity in which noncontrolling interests have been sold contains in-substance real estate, management estimatesthe extent to which the tot
al fair value of the assets of the entity is represented by the in-substance real estate and whether significant value exists beyond the in-substance real estate. Thi
s estimation considers all qualitative and quantitative factors relevant for each sale and, where appropriate, includes making quantitativeestimates about the f
air value of the entity and its identifiable assets and liabilities (including any favorable or unfavorable contracts) by analogy to the accountingstandards on business combinations. As such, 
these estimates may require significant judgment and assumptions, similar to the critical accounting estimatesdiscussed below for impairm
ents and fair value.Impairments 
— Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 — General and Summary of SignificantAccounting Policies 
, included in Item 8 of this For m 10-K. The Company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-livedassets; however, the
 fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation.The Company determines the f
air value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair valuemeasurement accounting framew
ork. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting unitsand long-lived assets; however, du
e to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on theincome approach. The Company may 
engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independentvaluation firm conside
rs all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost-benefit analysis and the Company's internal valuation knowledge of the long-livedasset (asset group) or business. Th
e Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations.Additionally, the Company uses an int
ernal discounted cash flow valuation model (the "DCF model"), based on the principles of present value techniques, toestimate the fai
r value of its reporting units or long-lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internalbudgets and cash flow forecasts, 
adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.Management applies consid
erable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts.Examples of the input assumpt
ions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation,exchange rates, power pric
es and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources(e.g., Economic Intellig
ence Unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of theseinput assumptions are dependen
t on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such asestimation differ
ences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to ourbudgets and cash flows are based on exp
ectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market datasources have different vie
ws of the macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions areoften available in a n
arrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could producesignificantly diffe
rent budgets and cash flow forecasts.A considerable amount of judgm
ent is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to thediscount rate are obta
ined from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from therelevant industry to est
imate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely marketparticipants. It is r
easonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the useof a different discount rate.
Fair value of a reporting un
it or a long-lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discountrate. Further, estimates of
 long-term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process,management analyzes 
the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carryingamount decreases. Changes in any o
f these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, whichcould be material. Our im
pairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipatedfuture economic and oper
ating conditions.Further discussion of the impa
irment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 10 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 21 —Asset Impairment Expense 
and Note 9 — Other Non-Operating Expense to the Consolidated Financial St atements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.114

Fair ValueFair Value Hierarchy 
— The Company uses valuation techniqu es and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use ofunobservable inputs
. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observableprices are not avail
able, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some levelof management estim
ation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments' complexity.To increase consistency
 and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard includes a fair value hierarchyto prioritize the inpu
ts used to measure fair value into three categories. An asset or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level ofinput significant to the 
fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, seeNote 1— 
General and Summary of Significant Accounting Po licies included in Item 8 of this For m 10-K.Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
— A significant number of the Comp any's financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair valuerecognized in earnings or o
ther comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fairvalue in preparing the Consolid
ated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long-term investments in debt and equity securities,included in the balance sh
eet line items Short-term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent) , derivative assets, inc luded in Other current asset s and Other assets (Noncurrent) 
and derivative liabi lities, included in Accrued and other liabiliti es (current) and Other long-term liabilities . Investments are gener ally fair valuedbased on quoted mar
ket prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit,government debt securit
ies and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company'sderivatives primar
ily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding thenature of these financ
ial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note  4 — Fair Value included in Item 8 of this For m 10-K.Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities 
— Significant estimates are ma de in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets(i.e., property, plant and equ
ipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the majority of assets acquired andliabilities assumed 
in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance. In determining the fair value ofthese items, managem
ent makes several assumptions as discussed in the Impairments section above.Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activ
ities — We enter into various de rivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certainmarket risks. We primarily u
se derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivativetransactions for trad
ing purposes.In accordance with the a
ccounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet andmeasure those instrumen
ts at fair value except where derivatives qualify and are designated as "normal purchase/normal sale" transactions. Changes in fair value ofderivatives are recognized in
 earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the samecategory as that gener
ated by the underlying asset or liability. See Note 6 — Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities included in Item 8 of this For m 10-Kfor further information on
 the classification.The accounting standards for d
erivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposurebeing hedged. These hedge designat
ions include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and isdesignated and qualifies 
as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has nofair value hedges at th
is time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferredin accumulated other 
comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earningsimmediately. For all h
edge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accountingstandards for derivativ
es and hedging.The fair value measur
ement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would bereceived to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair valuemeasurement standard requires
 the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors includenonperformance risk (th
e risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets).Due to the nature of the Company's in
terest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non-recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiarylevel rather than a
t the Parent Company level. Nonperformance115

risk on the Company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuationmodels that utilize obs
ervable market inputs.As a result of uncertai
nty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financialstatements under diff
erent conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerningnonperformance, volati
lities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterparty's), and future exchange rates.Refer to Note  
4 — Fair Value included in Item 8 of this For m 10-K for additional details.The fair value of our der
ivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputsincluding interest ra
te curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument marketassumptions from market 
efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters and Platt's). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management usescomparable market sources an
d empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, the publishedcurve may not extend t
hrough the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Specifically, where there islimited forward curve d
ata with respect to foreign exchange contracts, beyond the traded points the Company utilizes the purchasing power parity approach toconstruct the remain
ing portion of the forward curve using relative inflation rates. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on "indicativepricing" quotes from finan
cial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do notconstitute either a b
id or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models orassumptions could 
have a material effect on the calculated fair value.Regulatory Assets 
— Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such asapplicable regulato
ry changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If futurerecovery of costs ceases 
to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income.Consolidation 
— The Company has recently ente red into several transactions whereby the Company sells an interest in its controlled subsidiaries and/orequity method investments. 
In connection with each transaction, the Company must determine whether the sale of the interest impacts the Company's consolidationconclusion by first deter
mining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model or the voting model. In determining whichconsolidation model appli
es to the transaction, the Company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which arewhether (i) the entity ha
s sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and(iii) whether the ent
ity has non-substantive voting rights.If the entity is determined t
o be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the Company must consolidate the entity iswhether the subsidiary, includ
ing its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. If AES is determined to have power and benefits, theentity will be consolidat
ed by AES.Alternatively, if the 
entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-AES shareholdershave substantive partic
ipating rights. The assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights requires significant judgment sincethe rights provided under shar
eholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the compensation of management responsible for implementingthe subsidiary's policies and p
rocedures, establishing operating and capital decisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. On theother hand, if shareholder 
rights are only protective in nature (referred to as protective rights) then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the ownerof a majority voting int
erest shall consolidate its investee. Significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participatingrights or protective r
ights that do not affect the evaluation of control. While both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlyingactivity or action to whi
ch the right relates.Pension and Other Postretirement Plans 
— Effective January 1, 2016 the Comp any will apply a disaggregated discount rate approach for determiningservice cost and inter
est cost for its defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement plans in the U.S. and U.K. Refer to Note 1 — General and Summary ofSignificant Accounting Poli

 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOverview Regarding Market Risks 
— Our businesses are exposed to and proa ctively manage market risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to the priceof commodities, particularly electricit
y, oil, natural gas, coal and environmental credits. We116

operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency,the U.S. Dollar, and currencies of 
the countries in which we operate. We are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations due to our issuance of debt and relatedfinancial instruments.
The disclosures presented in 
this Item 7A are based upon a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. The safe harbor provided in Section 27A of theSecurities Act of 1933 and Section 21E o
f the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall apply to the disclosures contained in this Item 7A. For further informationregarding market risk, s
ee Item 1A.— Risk Factors , Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currencyexchange rates experienc
ed at our foreign operations , Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result ofrisks associated with the ele
ctricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance, and We may not be adequately hedgedagainst our exposure to changes in commodity pri
ces or interest rates of this 2015 Form 10-K. Commodity Price Risk 
— Although we prefer to hedge our exposur e to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, fuels and environmentalcredits, some of our gener
ation businesses operate under short-term sales or under contract sales that leave an unhedged exposure on some of our capacity orthrough imperfect fue
l pass-throughs. In our utility businesses, we may be exposed to commodity price movements depending on our excess or shortfall ofgeneration relativ
e to load obligations and sharing or pass-through mechanisms. These businesses subject our operational results to the volatility of prices forelectricity, fuels and enviro
nmental credits in competitive markets. We employ risk management strategies to hedge our financial performance against the effectsof fluctuations in energy 
commodity prices. The implementation of these strategies can involve the use of physical and financial commodity contracts, futures,swaps and options. At our generation business
es for 2016-2018, 80% to 85% of our variable margin is hedged against changes in commodity prices. At our utilitybusinesses for 2016-2018, 85% to 90% of our va
riable margin is insulated from changes in commodity prices.The portion of our sales and purch
ases that are not subject to such agreements or contracted businesses where indexation is not perfectly matched to businessdrivers will be exposed to com
modity price risk. When hedging the output of our generation assets, we utilize contract sales that lock in the spread per MWhbetween variable costs and 
the price at which the electricity can be sold.AES businesses will see changes in vari
able margin performance as global commodity prices shift. For 2016, we project pretax earnings exposure on a 10%move in commodity prices would b
e approximately $25 million for U.S. power (DPL), less than $5 million for natural gas, $5 million for oil and $10 million forcoal. 
Our estimates exclude co rrelation of oil with coal or natural gas. For example, a decline in oil or natural gas prices can be accompanied by a decline in coalprice if commodity pr
ices are correlated. In aggregate, the Company's downside exposure occurs with lower oil, lower natural gas, and higher coal prices.Exposures at individual businesses wi
ll change as new contracts or financial hedges are executed, and our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices generallyincreases in later y
ears with reduced hedge levels at some of our businesses.Commodity prices affect o
ur businesses differently depending on the local market characteristics and risk management strategies. Spot power prices, contractindexation provisions and gener
ation costs can be directly or indirectly affected by movements in the price of natural gas, oil and coal. We have some naturaloffsets across our businesses such 
that low commodity prices may benefit certain businesses and be a cost to others. Exposures are not perfectly linear orsymmetric. The sensitivities
 are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors. Examples of these factors include hydrology, local energy marketsupply/demand balances, reg
ional fuel supply issues, regional competition, bidding strategies and regulatory interventions such as price caps. Operationalflexibility changes th
e shape of our sensitivities. For instance, certain power plants may limit downside exposure by reducing dispatch in low market environments.Volume variation also af
fects our commodity exposure. The volume sold under contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weather and economic conditionsresulting in a higher or lowe
r volume of sales in spot markets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology can affect the generation output available for sale and canaffect the margin
al unit setting power prices.In the US SBU, the generation businesses are 
largely contracted but may have residual risk to the extent contracts are not perfectly indexed to the businessdrivers. IPL sells power at wholesa
le once retail demand is served, so retail sales demand may affect commodity exposure. Additionally, at DPL, open accessallows our retail custom
ers to switch to alternative suppliers; falling energy prices may increase the rate of switching; DPL sells generation in excess of its retaildemand under short-term s
ales. Given that natural gas-fired generators set power prices for many markets, higher natural gas prices expand margins. The positiveimpact on margins will be 
moderated if natural gas-fired generators set the market price only during peak periods.In the Andes SBU, our business in Chile owns assets in the c
entral and northern regions of the country and has a portfolio of contract sales in both. In thecentral region, the contract 
sales generally cover the efficient generation from our coal-fired and hydroelectric assets. Any residual spot price risk will primarily bedriven by the amount of hydrologi
cal inflows. In the case of low hydroelectric generation, spot price exposure is capped by the ability to dispatch our naturalgas/diesel assets the pr
ice of which depends on fuel pricing at the time required. There is a small amount of coal generation in the northern region that is notcovered by the portfolio of 
contract sales and therefore subject to spot price risk. In both regions, generators with oil or oil-117

linked fuel generally set power prices. In Colombia, we operate under a short-term sales strategy and have commodity exposure to unhedged volumes. Because weown hydroelectric assets th
ere, contracts are not indexed to fuel.In the Brazil SBU, the hydroelect
ric generating facility is covered by contract sales. Under normal hydrological volatility, spot price risk is mitigated througha regulated sharing me
chanism across all hydroelectric generators in the country. Under drier conditions, the sharing mechanism may not be sufficient to cover thebusiness' contract position, and 
therefore it may have to purchase power at spot prices driven by the cost of thermal generation.In the MCAC SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on unhedg
ed volumes. Panama is highly contracted under a portfolio of fixed volume contractsales. To the extent hydrologi
cal inflows are greater than or less than the contract sales volume, the business will be sensitive to changes in spot power prices whichmay be driven by oil prices 
in some time periods. In the Dominican Republic, we own natural gas-fired assets contracted under a portfolio of contract sales and acoal-fired asset con
tracted with a single contract, and both contract and spot prices may move with commodity prices. Additionally, the contract levels do notalways match our generat
ion availability and our assets may be sellers of spot prices in excess of contract levels or a net buyer in the spot market to satisfy contractobligations.
In the Europe SBU, our Kilroot facili
ty operates on a short-term sales strategy. To the extent that sales are unhedged, the commodity risk at our Kilrootbusiness is to the clean dark sp
read, which is the difference between electricity price and our coal-based variable dispatch cost including emissions. Natural gas-fired generators set powe
r prices for many periods, so higher natural gas prices generally expand margins and higher coal or emissions prices reduce them.Similarly, increased wind g
enerators displaces higher cost generation, reducing Kilroot's margins, and vice versa.In the Asia SBU, our Masinloc business is a coa
l-fired generation facility which hedges its output under a portfolio of contract sales that are indexed to fuelprices, with generation in 
excess of contract volume or shortfalls of generation relative to contract volumes settled in the spot market. Low oil prices may be adriver of margin compr
ession since oil affects spot power sale prices sold in the spot market. Low oil prices may be a driver of margin compression since oilaffects spot power sale pr
ices. Our Mong Duong business has minimal exposure to commodity price risk as it has no merchant exposure and fuel is subject to apass-through mechanism.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
— In the normal course of busin ess, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risks that arise frominvestments in foreign subsid
iaries and affiliates. A key component of these risks stems from the fact that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilizecurrencies other than ou
r consolidated reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar ("USD"). Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered intomonetary obligations in th
e USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies. We have varying degrees of exposure to changes in the exchange ratebetween the USD and the following curren
cies: Argentine Peso, British Pound, Brazilian Real, Chilean Peso, Colombian Peso, Dominican Peso, Euro, IndianRupee, Kazakhstan Tenge, Mexican Peso and Phi
lippine Peso. These subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure byentering into revenue con
tracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forwards, swaps and options, where possible, tomanage our risk relat
ed to certain foreign currency fluctuations.We have entered into hedg
es to partially mitigate the exposure of earnings translated into the USD to foreign exchange volatility. The largest foreignexchange risks over a 12-month 
forward-looking period stem from the following currencies: Argentine Peso, British Pound, Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, Euroand Kazakhstan Tenge. As of 
December 31, 2015 , assuming a 10% USD appreciation, adjus ted pretax earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries exposed tomovement in the exchange 
rate of the Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, Euro and Kazakhstan Tenge relative to the USD are projected to bereduced by approximately $5 
million, British Pound — less than $5 million for 2016. These numbers have been produced by applying a one-time 10% USDappreciation to fore
casted exposed pretax earnings for 2016 coming from the respec tive subsidiaries exposed to the currencies listed above, net of the impact ofoutstanding hedges and holding all o
ther variables constant. The numbers presented above are net of any transactional gains/losses. These sensitivities may changein the future as new hedges ar
e executed or existing hedges are unwound. Additionally, updates to the forecasted pretax earnings exposed to foreign exchange riskmay result in further modificati
on. The sensitivities presented do not capture the impacts of any administrative market restrictions or currency inconvertibility.Interest Rate Risks 
— We are exposed to risk resu lting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt, as well asinterest rate swap, cap, 
floor and option agreements.Decisions on the fixed-floa
ting debt mix are made to be consistent with the risk factors faced by individual businesses or plants. Depending on whether aplant's capacity paymen
ts or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation, we partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by arranging fixed-rate or variable-rate financing. In certain case
s, particularly for non-recourse financing, we execute interest rate swap, cap and floor agreements to effectively fix or limit theinterest rate exposur
e on the underlying financing. Most of our interest rate risk is related to non-recourse financings at our businesses.As of 
December 31, 2015 , the portfolio's pretax e arnings exposure for 2016 to a 100-basis-point incre ase in interest rates118

for our Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, Euro, Kazakhstani Tenge and USD denominated debt would be approximately $30 million based on theimpact of a one time,100
-basis-point upward shift in interest rates on interest expense for the debt denominated in these currencies. These amounts do not take intoaccount the historica
l correlation between these interest rates.119

ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPP LEMENTARY DATAREPORT OF INDEPENDENT RE
GISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholde
rs of The AES Corporation:We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of The AES Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidatedstatements of operat
ions, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. Our auditsalso included the financ
ial statement schedules listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company’smanagement. Our responsibil
ity is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require thatwe plan and perform t
he audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit also includesexamining, on a test basis, ev
idence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principlesused and significant e
stimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide areasonable basis for our opin
ion.In our opinion, the financia
l statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The AES Corporation atDecember 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolid
ated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, inconformity with U.S. generally a
ccepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to thebasic financial statements taken
 as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidat
ed financial statements, the Company changed its requirements for reporting discontinued operations as a result of theadoption of the amendments 
to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification resulting from Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, “Reporting DiscontinuedOperations and Disclosures of Disposals o
f Components of an Entity,” effective July 1, 2014. Also, the Company changed its accounting for service concessionarrangements as a resu
lt of the adoption of the amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification resulting from Accounting Standards Update No.2014-05, “Service Concession Arrangem
ents,” effective January 1, 2015. Lastly, the Company changed its classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities asa result of the adoption of 
the amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification resulting from Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, “IncomeTaxes,” effective Dec
ember 31, 2015.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The AES Corporation’s internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
 
1 
. GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe AES Corporation is a holding company (th
e "Parent Company") that through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, "AES" or "the Company")operates a geographica
lly diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, given this holding company structure, the liabilitiesof the individual operat
ing entities are non-recourse to the parent and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limitedliability entiti
es, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting orvariable interest model.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 
— The Consolidated Financial Stat ements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and itssubsidiaries, which are the 
entities that it controls. Furthermore, variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which the Company has a variable interest have beenconsolidated when the Company is the p
rimary beneficiary and thus controls the VIE. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.Investments in entiti
es where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method ofaccounting.
DP&L, our utility in Ohio, has undivided int
erests in five generation facilities and numerous transmission facilities. These undivided interests in jointly-owned facilities are 
accounted for on a pro-rata basis in our consolidated financial statements. Certain expenses, primarily fuel costs for the generating units, areallocated to the join
t owners based on their energy usage. The remaining expenses, investments in fuel inventory, plant materials and operating supplies and capitaladditions are alloca
ted to the joint owners in accordance with their respective ownership interests. See Note 3 — Property, Plant and Equipment for additional details.
USE OF ESTIMATES 
— The preparation of t hese consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America ("GAAP") requi
res the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosuresof contingent assets and li
abilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reportingperiod. Actual results could d
iffer from those estimates. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include: the carrying amount and estimated useful lives oflong-lived assets; asset 
retirement obligations; impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and equity method investments; valuation allowances for receivables anddeferred tax assets; the reco
verability of regulatory assets; the estimation of regulatory liabilities; the fair value of financial instruments; the fair value of assets andliabilities acqui
red in a business combination; the measurement of noncontrolling interest using the hypothetical liquidation at book value ("HLBV") method forcertain renewable gen
eration partnerships; the determination of whether a sale of noncontrolling interests is considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate (asopposed to an eq
uity transaction); pension liabilities; environmental liabilities; and potential litigation claims and settlements.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND
 HELD-FOR-SALE BUSINESSES — Effective July 1, 2014, the Company prosp ectively adopted AccountingStandards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-08, 
Presentation of Financial Stat ements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reportingdiscontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals o
f Components of an Entity , which significantly changed the prior accounting guidance on discontinuedoperations. Under ASU No. 2014-08, only those disposals of compon
ents of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on anentity's operations and fin
ancial results are reported as discontinued operations. Amongst other changes: equity method investments that were previously scoped-out of the discontinued opera
tions accounting guidance are now included in the scope; a business can meet the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale uponacquisition and be report
ed in discontinued operations; and components where an entity retains significant continuing involvement or where operations and cashflows will not be eliminat
ed from ongoing operations as a result of a disposal transaction can meet the definition of discontinued operations. Additionally, wheresummarized amounts are prese
nted on the face of the financial statements, reconciliations of those amounts to major classes of line items are also required. ASUNo. 2014-08 requires additional dis
closures for individually material components that do not meet the definition of discontinued operations. Under the previousaccounting guidance, DPLER and Kelanitiss
a (which both met the Held-for-Sale criteria in 2015) and the Armenia Mountain, U.K. Wind (Operating Projects), andEbute disposals would have met the d
iscontinued operations criteria and would have been reclassified accordingly. See Note 24 — Dispositions and Held-for-SaleBusinesses 
for further information. Prior to July 1, 2014, a discontinued oper
ation was a component of the Company that either had been disposed of or was classified as held for sale and wherethe Company did not expect to have s
ignificant cash flows from or significant continuing involvement with the component as of one year after its disposal or sale.A component was comprised of opera
tions and cash flows that could be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest ofthe Company. Before the Company's adoption o
f ASU No. 2014-08, prior period amounts were retrospectively revised to reflect the126

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
businesses determined to be d
iscontinued operations. For components that had been determined to be discontinued operations and held for sale businesses under theold standard, the relat
ed cash flows are included within the relevant categories within operating, investing and financing activities. The aggregate amount of cashflows is offset by the net inc
rease or decrease in cash of discontinued and held for sale businesses, which is presented as a separate line item in the ConsolidatedStatements of Cash Flows.
When an operation is class
ified as held for sale, the Company recognizes impairment expense, if any, at the consolidated financial statement level which alsoincludes noncontrolling int
erests. However, any gain or loss on the completion of a disposal transaction is recognized only for the Company's ownership interest.Upon adoption of ASU No. 2014-08 on July 1, 2014, the Company no longer recasts p
rior period results related to operations classified as held for sale. All assetsand liabilities of he
ld-for-sale businesses are classified as current as they are expected to be disposed of within twelve months.RECLASSIFICATIONS 
— Certain prior period amoun ts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the currentpresentation. Non-cas
h impacts related to a regulatory liability at Eletropaulo were reclassified from the Increase (decrease) in ac counts payable and other currentliabilities 
and Increase (decrease) in other liabilities lines to the (Reversals of) provisions for con tingencies line on the Consolidated State ment of Cash Flows forthe year ended December 31, 2013. Addi
tionally, amounts related to certain transactions pertaining to noncontrolling interests were reclassified from theContributions from noncontrolling interes
t line to the Proceeds from sales to noncontrolling in terests, net of transaction costs line on the Consolidated State mentof Cash flows for the years ended Dec
ember 31, 2014 and 2013.FAIR VALUE 
— Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly, hypothetical transaction betweenmarket participants at the measureme
nt date, or exit price. The Company applies the fair value measurement accounting guidance to financial assets and liabilitiesin determining the fa
ir value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities, included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line items Short-term investments and 
Other assets (noncurrent) ; derivative assets, in cluded in Other current assets and Other assets (noncurrent) ; and, derivative liab ilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (curr
ent) and Other long-term liabilities . The Company applies the fair v alue measurement guidance to nonfinancial assets and liabilities uponthe acquisition of a business o
r in conjunction with the measurement of an asset retirement obligation or a potential impairment loss on an asset group or goodwillunder the accounting guidanc
e for the impairment of long-lived assets or goodwill.The Company makes assumptions about what 
market participants would assume in valuing an asset or liability based on the best information available.These factors include nonpe
rformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk of the subsidiary (for liabilities) and of the counterparty(for assets). The Company is prohib
ited from including transaction costs and any adjustments for blockage factors in determining fair value. The principal or mostadvantageous market is cons
idered from the perspective of the subsidiary owning the asset or with the liability.Fair value is based on observabl
e market prices where available. Where they are not available, specific valuation models and techniques are applieddepending on what is being fair va
lued. These models and techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Theprocess involves varying leve
ls of management judgment, the degree of which is dependent on price transparency and complexity. An asset's or liability's levelwithin the fair value hi
erarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest.The three levels are d
efined as follows:•
Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets accessible by the Company for identical assets or liabilities. Active markets are those in whichtransactions for the ass
et or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.•
Level 2 — pricing inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 which are based on observable market data, that are directly or indirectlyobservable for substa
ntially the full term of the asset or liability. These include quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted market pricesfor identical or similar assets
 in markets that are not active, adjusted quoted market prices, inputs from observable data such as interest rate and yieldcurves, volatilities or defa
ult rates observable at commonly quoted intervals or inputs derived from observable market data by correlation or other means.•
Level 3 — pricing inputs that are unobservable from objective sources. Unobservable inputs are only used to the extent observable inputs aren't available.These inputs maintain t
he concept of an exit price from the perspective of a market participant and reflect assumptions of other market participants. TheCompany considers all marke
t participant assumptions that are available without unreasonable cost and effort. These are given the lowest priority and aregenerally used in intern
ally developed methodologies to generate management's best estimate of the fair value when no observable market data isavailable.
127

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
Any transfers between all l
evels within the fair value hierarchy levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period.CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
— The Company considers unrestric ted cash on hand, deposits in banks, certificates of deposit and short-termmarketable securi
ties with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of such balances approximate fairvalue.
RESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERVICE RESERVES 
— These include cash balanc es which are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by thesubsidiary that owns the cash. The na
ture of restrictions includes restrictions imposed by financing agreements such as security deposits kept as collateral, debtservice reserves, ma
intenance reserves, contractual terms and others, as well as restrictions imposed by agreements related to the sales of businesses or long-termPPAs.
INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURIT
IES — The Company's marketable inves tments are primarily unsecured debentures, certificates ofdeposit, government debt secu
rities and money market funds. Short-term investments consist of marketable equity securities and debt securities with originalmaturities in excess o
f three months with remaining maturities of less than one year.Marketable debt securities that
 the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried atamortized cost. Other marketa
ble securities that the Company does not intend to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale or trading and are carried at fairvalue. Available-for-sale in
vestments are fair valued at the end of each reporting period where the unrealized gains or losses are reflected in accumulated othercomprehensive loss ("AOCL"), a separa
te component of equity.Investments classifi
ed as trading are fair valued at the end of each reporting period through the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest and dividendson investments are repor
ted in interest income and other income , respectively. Gains and losses on s ales of investments are determined using the specificidentification method.
ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND ALLO
WANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS — Accounts and notes receivabl e are carried atamortized cost. The C
ompany periodically assesses the collectability of accounts receivable, considering factors such as specific evaluation of collectability,historical collection experience,
 the age of accounts receivable and other currently available evidence of the collectability, and records an allowance for doubtfulaccounts for the estimated 
uncollectible amount as appropriate. Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts receivable either under contractual terms orwhere charging interest 
is a customary business practice. In such cases, interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. When the collection of such interest isnot reasonably assured, inte
rest income is recognized as cash is received. Individual accounts and notes receivable are written off when they are no longer deemedcollectible.
INVENTORY 
— Inventory primarily cons ists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and spare parts and supplies used to maintain powergeneration and distribut
ion facilities. Inventory is carried at lower of cost or market. Cost is the sum of the purchase price and incidental expenditures and chargesincurred to bring the inven
tory to its existing condition or location. Costs of inventory are valued primarily using the average cost method. Generally, cost isreduced to market valu
e if the market value of inventory has declined and it is probable that the utility of inventory, in its disposal in the ordinary course ofbusiness, will not be recovered 
through revenue earned from the generation of power.LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
— Long-lived assets include prop erty, plant and equipment, assets under capital leases and intangible assets subject toamortization (i.e., finite-lived i
ntangible assets).Property, plant and equipment 
— Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of renewals and improvementsthat extend the useful life
 of property, plant and equipment are capitalized.Construction progress payments, eng
ineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly relating to construction in progress arecapitalized during th
e construction period, provided the completion of the project is deemed probable, or expensed at the time the Company determines thatdevelopment of a parti
cular project is no longer probable. The continued capitalization of such costs is subject to ongoing risks related to successful completion,including those related 
to government approvals, site identification, financing, construction permitting and contract compliance. Construction-in-progress balancesare transferred to 
electric generation and distribution assets when an asset group is ready for its intended use. Government subsidies, liquidated damages recoveredfor construction delays and 
income tax credits are recorded as a reduction to property, plant and equipment and reflected in cash flows from investing activities.Depreciation, after considerati
on of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimateduseful lives of the assets, whi
ch are determined on a composite or component basis. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Capital spareparts, including rotable sp
are parts, are included in electric generation and distribution assets. If the spare part is considered a component, it is depreciated over itsuseful life after
128

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
the part is placed in se
rvice. If the spare part is deemed part of a composite asset, the part is depreciated over the composite useful life even when being held as aspare part.
The Company's Brazilian subsidiar
ies, which include both generation and distribution companies, operate under concession contracts. Certain estimates areutilized to determ
ine depreciation expense for the Brazilian subsidiaries, including the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and the amounts to berecovered at the end of 
the concession contract. The amounts to be recovered under these concession contracts are based on estimates that are inherently uncertainand actual amounts recov
ered may differ from those estimates. These concession contracts are not within the scope of ASC 853— Service Concession Arrangements 
. Intangible Assets Subject to Amort
ization — Finite-lived intangibl e assets are amortized over their useful lives which range from 1  – 50  years. TheCompany accounts for purchased e
mission allowances as intangible assets and records an expense when utilized or sold. Granted emission allowances are valued atzero.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
— When circumstances ind icate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets (asset group) held-for-use may not berecoverable, the Company ev
aluates the assets for potential impairment using internal projections of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use andeventual disposal of the ass
ets. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation may include, but are not limited to, adversechanges in the regulatory 
environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid,technological advance
ments, declining trends in demand, or an expectation that it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of itspreviously estimated use
ful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows and exceeds any fair value of the assets, an impairmentexpense is recognized for 
the excess up to the carrying amount of the long-lived assets (but up to any fair value for any individual long-lived asset that isdeterminable without undue 
cost and effort). For regulated assets where recovery through approved rates is probable, an impairment expense could be reduced bythe establishment of a 
regulatory asset. For other regulated assets and for non-regulated assets, impairment is recognized as an expense. When long-lived assetsmeet the criter
ia to be classified as held-for-sale and the carrying amount of the disposal group exceeds its fair value less costs to sell, an impairment expense isrecognized for the exc
ess up to the carrying amount of the long-lived assets; if the fair value of the disposal group subsequently exceeds the carrying amount whilethe disposal group is still he
ld-for-sale, any impairment expense previously recognized will be reversed up to the lower of the prior expense or the subsequentexcess.
SERVICE CONCESSION ASSETS 
— Service concession assets a re stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization, in accordance with ASC 853. Serviceconcession assets represen
t the cost of all infrastructure to be transferred to the public-sector entity grantors at the end of the concession. These costs primarilyrepresent construction p
rogress payments, engineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly relating to construction of the serviceconcession infrastructu
re. Government subsidies, liquidated damages recovered for construction delays and income tax credits are recorded as a reduction toService Concession Assets. Service con
cession assets are amortized and recognized in earnings as a cost of goods sold. Amortization is recorded ratably as buildrevenue is recognized.
For additional details r
egarding the impact of service concession accounting on certain of the Company's businesses, see New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 
— ASU No. 2014-05, Service Concession Arrangements (Topic 853) below. DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS 
— Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the relatedfinancing period using the e
ffective interest method. Make-whole payments in connection with early debt retirements are classified as cash flows used in financingactivities.
EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 
— Investments in entiti es over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,are accounted for using th
e equity method of accounting and reported in Investments in and advances to aff iliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company periodically assesses 
if there is an indication that the fair value of an equity method investment is less than its carrying amount. When an indicator exists,any excess of the carrying 
amount over its estimated fair value is recognized as impairment when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and included inOther non-operating expense in 
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between the carrying amount and our underlying equity in the net assetsof the investee are a
ccounted for as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary, except that the portion that represents equity method goodwill is not reviewedfor impairment lik
e consolidated goodwill.  Upon acquiring the investment, we determine the fair value of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and thebasis difference between eac
h fair value and the carrying amount of the corresponding asset or liability in the financial statements of the investee are recognized inour net equity in earni
ngs of affiliates over the life of the asset or liability.The Company discontinues the appli
cation of the equity method when an investment is reduced to zero and the Company is not otherwise committed toprovide further financ
ial support to the investee. The Company resumes the application of the129

equity method if the inves
tee subsequently reports net income to the extent that the Company's share of such net income equals the share of net losses notrecognized during the per
iod in which the equity method of accounting was suspended.GOODWILL AND INDEF
INITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS — The Company evaluates goodwill and ind efinite-lived intangible assets forimpairment on an annual b
asis and whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. The Company's annual impairmenttesting date is October 1.
Goodwill 
— The Company evaluates goodwill imp airment at the reporting unit level, which is an SBU (i.e. an operating segment as defined in the segmentreporting accounting guidan
ce), or a component (i.e., one level below an operating segment). In determining its reporting units, the Company starts with itsmanagement reporting s
tructure. Operating segments are identified and then analyzed to identify components which make up these operating segments. Two ormore components are comb
ined into a single reporting unit if they are economically similar. Assets and liabilities are allocated to a reporting unit if the assets willbe employed by or a liabil
ity relates to the operations of the reporting unit or would be considered by a market participant in determining its fair value. Goodwillresulting from an acquis
ition is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Generally, each AES business witha goodwill balance constitu
tes a reporting unit as they are not reported to segment management together with other businesses and are not similar to otherbusinesses in a segment.
Goodwill is evaluated for imp
airment either under the qualitative assessment option or the two-step test approach depending on facts and circumstances of areporting unit, including th
e excess of fair value over carrying amount in the last valuation or changes in business environment. If the Company qualitativelydetermines it is more likely t
han not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.Otherwise, goodwill is evaluated 
for impairment using the two-step test, where the carrying amount of a reporting unit is compared to its fair value in Step 1; if thefair value exceeds th
e carrying amount, Step 2 is unnecessary. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, this could indicate potentialimpairment and Step 2 of th
e goodwill evaluation process is required to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss torecognize, if any. When Step 2 
is necessary, the fair value of individual assets and liabilities is determined using valuations (which in some cases may be based inpart on third party valua
tion reports) or other observable sources of fair value, as appropriate. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, theexcess is recognized as an 
impairment loss up to the carrying amount of the goodwill.Most of the Company's reporting units 
are not publicly traded. Therefore, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using internal budgetsand forecasts, adjusted fo
r any market participants' assumptions and discounted at the rate of return required by a market participant. The Company considers bothmarket and income-bas
ed approaches to determine a range of fair value, but typically concludes that the value derived using an income-based approach is morerepresentative of fair value d
ue to the lack of direct market comparables. The Company utilizes market data, when available, to corroborate and determine thereasonableness of the fa
ir value derived from the income-based discounted cash flow analysis.Indefinite-Lived Intang
ible Assets — The Company's indefinite-liv ed intangible assets primarily include land-use rights and water rights. These are tested forimpairment on an annual b
asis or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. If the carrying amount of an intangibleasset exceeds its fai
r value, the excess is recognized as impairment expense. When deemed appropriate, the Company uses the qualitative assessment option underthe accounting guidance on goodwil
l and intangible assets to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not thatan intangible asset is i
mpaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that anintangible asset is imp
aired, no further action is taken. The accounting guidance provides the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any intangible asset inany period and procee
d directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED L
IABILITIES — Accounts payable consists of amoun ts due to trade creditors related to theCompany's core business operations. Thes
e payables include amounts owed to vendors and suppliers for items such as energy purchased for resale, fuel,maintenance, inventory an
d other raw materials. Other accrued liabilities include items such as income taxes, regulatory liabilities, legal contingencies andemployee-related 
costs including payroll, benefits and related taxes.REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
— The Company rec ords assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that arenot recognized under GAAP for non-regula
ted entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred due to the future recovery incustomer rates being prob
able. Generally, returns earned on regulatory assets are reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Operations within Interest Income . Regulatory liabiliti
es generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers. Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable offuture recovery and regulat
ory of liabilities are probable of future payment by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate ordersapplicable to other r
egulated entities and the status of any130

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
pending or potential deregu
lation legislation. If future recovery of costs previously deferred ceases to be probable, the related regulatory assets are written off andrecognized in income f
rom continuing operations.PENSION AND OTHER P
OSTRETIREMENT PLANS — The Company recognizes in its Consolid ated Balance Sheets an asset or liability reflecting thefunded status of pension and other pos
tretirement plans with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in AOCL, except for those plans at certainof the Company's regulated uti
lities that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligations through future rates. All plan assets are recorded atfair value. AES follows the measu
rement date provisions of the accounting guidance, which require a year-end measurement date of plan assets and obligations forall defined benefit plans.
Effective January 1, 2016, the Comp
any will apply a disaggregated discount rate approach for determining service cost and interest cost for its definedbenefit pension plans and post-
retirement plans in the U.S. and U.K. This approach is consistent with the requirements of ASC 715— Compensation—Retirement Benefits 
and is considered to be more p recise compared to the aggregated single rate discount approach, which has historically been used in the U.S. and U.K.,because it is more consis
tent with the philosophy of a full yield curve valuation. The disaggregated rate approach can be applied only in countries with asufficiently robust yie
ld curve. For countries other than the U.S. and U.K., the Company will continue to apply a local government bond yield approach.The change in discount rate 
approach in the U.S. and U.K. did not have an impact on the measurement of the benefit obligations as at December 31, 2015,nor will it impact futu
re remeasurements. This change in estimate will impact the service cost and interest cost recorded in 2016 and future years. It will alsoimpact the actuarial gains and
 losses recorded in future years, as well as the amortization thereof.The expected 2016 service cos
ts and interest costs included in Note 15 — Benefit Plans reflect the change in estimate described above. The impact of thechange in approach on expect
ed service costs for the U.S. and U.K. plans in 2016 is shown below (in millions):

$ 16  $18  $(2 ) $49  $60  $(11 )INCOME TAXES 
— Deferred tax assets a nd liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financialstatement carrying 
amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it ismore likely than not tha
t all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's tax positions are evaluated under a more likely than notrecognition threshold a
nd measurement analysis before they are recognized for financial statement reporting.Uncertain tax positions have b
een classified as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company's policy forinterest and penalti
es related to income tax exposures is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes in the ConsolidatedStatements of Operations.
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATI
ONS — The Company records the fair v alue of the liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period inwhich the obligation is incur
red. When a new liability is recognized, the Company capitalizes the costs of the liability by increasing the carrying amount of therelated long-lived asset. 
The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Uponsettlement of the obl
igation, the Company eliminates the liability and, based on the actual cost to retire, may incur a gain or loss.NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
— Noncontrolling interests a re classified as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets andConsolidated Statements of Changes 
in Equity. Additionally, net income and comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected separatelyfrom consolidated net in
come and comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Anychange in ownership of a subsidiary whi
le the controlling financial interest is retained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling andnoncontrolling interests 
(unless the transaction qualifies as a sale of in-substance real estate). Losses continue to be attributed to the noncontrolling interests, evenwhen the noncontrolling inter
ests' basis has been reduced to zero.Although, in general, the noncontro
lling ownership interest in earnings is calculated based on ownership percentage, certain of the Company's businesses aresubject to certain profit-shari
ng arrangements. These agreements exist for certain renewable generation partnerships to designate different allocations of valueamong investors, where the al
locations change in form or percentage over the life of the partnership. For these businesses, the Company uses the HLBV methodwhen it is a
131

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
reasonable approximat
ion of the profit-sharing arrangement. HLBV uses a balance sheet approach, which measures the Company's equity in income or loss bycalculating the chang
e in the amount of net worth the partners are legally able to claim based on a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at the beginning of areporting period compar
ed to the end of that period.FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
— A business's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the businessoperates and is general
ly the currency in which the business generates and expends cash. Subsidiaries and affiliates whose functional currency is a currency otherthan the U.S. Dollar translate 
their assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollars at the current exchange rates in effect at the end of the fiscal period. The revenue andexpense accounts of such subsidia
ries and affiliates are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates that prevailed during the period. Translationadjustments are includ
ed in AOCL. Gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency transactions that are long-term in nature and which the Company does notintend to settle in the 
foreseeable future, are also recognized in AOCL. Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in acurrency other than the f
unctional currency are included in determining net income. Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified to netincome only when realized upon s
ale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment in a foreign entity. The accumulated adjustments areincluded in carrying amoun
ts in impairment assessments where the Company has committed to a plan that will cause the accumulated adjustments to bereclassified to earnings.
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
— Revenue from utilities is classified as regulated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue from the sale ofenergy is recognized in th
e period during which the sale occurs. The calculation of revenue earned but not yet billed is based on the number of days not billed in themonth, the estimated a
mount of energy delivered during those days and the estimated average price per customer class for that month. Differences between actualand estimated unbilled 
revenue are usually immaterial. The Company has businesses where it sells and purchases power to and from Independent System Operators("ISOs") and Regional Transmission Organi
zations ("RTOs"). In those instances, the Company accounts for these transactions on a net hourly basis because thetransactions are set
tled on a net hourly basis. Revenue from generation businesses is classified as non-regulated and is recognized based upon output delivered andcapacity provided, at r
ates as specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates. Certain of the Company PPAs meet the definition of an operating lease orcontain similar arrangements. 
Typically, minimum lease payments from such PPAs are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term whereascontingent rentals ar
e recognized when earned. Revenue is recorded net of any taxes assessed on and collected from customers, which are remitted to thegovernmental authorities.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
— The Company grants share-based co mpensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, andperformance stock units. Th
e expense is based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued and is recognized on a straight-line basis overthe requisite servic
e period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock optionsgranted to its employees.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
— General and administra tive expenses include corporate and other expenses related to corporatestaff functions and initiati
ves, primarily executive management, finance, legal, human resources and information systems, which are not directly allocable to ourbusiness segments. Additionally, a
ll costs associated with corporate business development efforts are classified as general and administrative expenses.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACT
IVITIES — Under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognizes all contracts thatmeet the definition o
f a derivative, except those designated as normal purchase or normal sale at inception, as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated BalanceSheets and measures those inst
ruments at fair value. See the Company's fair value policy and Note 4— Fair Value for additional discussion r egarding thedetermination of the 
fair value. The PPAs and fuel supply agreements entered into by the Company are evaluated to determine if they meet the definition of aderivative or contain 
embedded derivatives, either of which require separate valuation and accounting. To be a derivative under the accounting standards forderivatives and hedging, an ag
reement would need to have a notional and an underlying, require little or no initial net investment and could be net settled.Generally, these agree
ments do not meet the definition of a derivative, often due to the inability to be net settled. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the markets forthe commodities to be deli
vered under these agreements to determine if facts and circumstances have changed such that the agreements could then be net settledand meet the definit
ion of a derivative.Derivatives primari
ly consist of interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity derivatives. The Company entersinto various derivative tra
nsactions in order to hedge its exposure to certain market risks, primarily interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price risks.Regarding interest rat
e risk, the Company and our subsidiaries generally utilize variable rate debt financing for construction projects and operations so interest rateswap, lock, cap, and floor agree
ments are entered into to manage interest rate risk by effectively fixing or limiting the interest rate exposure on the underlyingfinancing and are typic
ally designated as cash flow hedges. Regarding foreign currency risk, we are exposed to it as a result of our investments in foreignsubsidiaries and affiliates t
hat may be impacted by significant fluctuations in132

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
foreign currency exchang
e rates so foreign currency options and forwards are utilized, where deemed appropriate, to manage the risk related to these fluctuations.Cross-currency swa
ps are utilized in certain instances to manage the risk related to certain foreign currencies and the associated impact on interest and loanprincipal payments. In add
ition, certain of our subsidiaries have entered into contracts which contain embedded derivatives as a portion of the contracts primarilythat are denominated 
in a currency other than the functional or local currency of that subsidiary or the currency of the item. Regarding commodity price risk, weare exposed to the impac
t of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, fuel and environmental credits. Although we primarily consist of businesses with long-term contracts or r
etail sales concessions (which provide our distribution businesses with a franchise to serve a specific geographic region), a portion of our currentand expected future rev
enues are derived from businesses without significant long-term purchase or sales contracts. We use an overall hedging strategy, not justderivatives, to hedge 
our financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in commodity prices.The accounting standards for d
erivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposurebeing hedged. The Company only has cash flow hedg
es at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, designated and qualifies as acash flow hedge are defer
red in AOCL and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions affect earnings. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earningsimmediately. For all d
esignated and qualifying hedges, the Company maintains formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with theaccounting standards for de
rivatives and hedging. If AES determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting will bediscontinued prospectively. For 
cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, AES estimates the future cash flows of the forecasted transactions and evaluates theprobability of the occur
rence and timing of such transactions. Changes in conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could require discontinuance of hedgeaccounting or could affe
ct the timing of the reclassification of gains or losses on cash flow hedges from AOCL into earnings.While derivative t
ransactions are not entered into for trading purposes, some contracts are not eligible for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value ofderivatives not designat
ed and qualifying as cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings. Regardless of when gains or losses on derivatives (includingall those where the fai
r value measurement is classified as Level 3) are recognized in earnings, they are generally classified as follows: interest expense for interestrate and cross-curren
cy derivatives, foreign currency transaction gains or losses for foreign currency derivatives, and non-regulated revenue or non-regulated costof sales for commodity and o
ther derivatives. However, gains and losses on interest rate and cross-currency derivatives are classified as foreign currencytransaction gains and losses 
if they offset the remeasurement of the foreign currency-denominated debt being hedged by the cross-currency swaps and the amountreclassified from AOCL to cost o
f sales to offset depreciation where the variable-rate interest capitalized as part of the asset was hedged during its construction.Cash flows arising from deriva
tives are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity given the nature of the underlying riskbeing economically hedged 
and the lack of significant financing elements, except that cash flows on designated and qualifying hedges of variable-rate interestduring construction are c
lassified as an investing activity.The Company has elected not to of
fset net derivative positions in the financial statements. Accordingly, the Company does not offset such derivativepositions against the
 fair value of amounts (or amounts that approximate fair value) recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or theobligation to return cas
h collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.NEW ACCOUNTING PRON
OUNCEMENTS ADOPTEDASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Class
ification of Deferred TaxesEffective December 31, 2015, 
the Company prospectively adopted ASU No. 2015-17, which requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along withany related valuation 
allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred taxasset or liability. The gu
idance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction; that is, companies will remain prohibitedfrom offsetting deferred tax lia
bilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. Additionally, the current requirement that deferredtax liabilities and 
assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the update. As the Company elected toapply this ASU prospectively, prior pe
riods were not adjusted.ASU No. 2015-13, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Appli
cation of the Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Scope Exception to Certain ElectricityContracts within Nodal Energy Markets
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-13, which resolves the diversity in pr
actice resulting from determining whether certain contracts qualify forthe normal purchases and nor
mal sales scope exception under ASC Topic 815— Derivatives and Hedging . This standard clarifi es that entities would not beprecluded from applying th
e normal purchases and normal sales exception to certain forward contracts that necessitate the transmission of electricity through, ordelivery to a

location within, a nodal ene
rgy market. The standard is effective upon issuance and should be applied prospectively. As the Company had designated qualifyingcontracts as normal pur
chase or normal sales, there was no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this standard.ASU No. 2014-05, Service Concession Arrangements (Topic 853)
Effective January 1, 2015, the Comp
any adopted ASU No. 2014-05, which states that certain service concession arrangements with public-sector entitygrantors are not in scope of ASC 840— 
Leases, and that entities should not recognize the related infrastructure as property, plant and equipment, but should applyother GAAP. The Company has a small number of en
tities that fall within the scope of this guidance, with the Company's Mong Duong generation facility inVietnam being the most signi
ficant.Mong Duong is based on a build, operate and t
ransfer agreement with the Vietnamese government. Management concluded there were two deliverablesincluded within the arrang
ement, as well as a financing element. Due to the contingent nature of the revenue stream, no amounts of revenue could be recognizedduring the build phase of the con
tract. All amounts billed during the operate phase are recognized as revenue when billed, with amounts allocated between thefinancing element and buil
d and operate deliverables. The financing element is recognized as interest income using the effective interest method as payments forconstruction of the plant 
are received over the life of the contract. Costs are expensed as incurred. As the related infrastructure is no longer considered property,plant and equipment, ther
e are no longer any capitalizable expenses beyond those related to the initial build, and accordingly these will be expensed as incurred. Allcash flows for these arrang
ements, excluding those related to the debt incurred by AES, will be reflected in cash flows from operating activities on the Company'sConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows prospe
ctively.The guidance was applied on a modi
fied retrospective basis to service concession arrangements in existence at January 1, 2015. Upon adoption of thisstandard, the impact to 
the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2015 resulted in a reclassification of $1.5 billion from property, plant and equipment to service con
cession assets, as well as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings and cumulative translation adjustment of $(18) million , net of tax, and 
$13 million , respectively. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCE
MENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE — The following accounting standa rds have been issued, but are not yeteffective for, and hav
e not been adopted in these financial statements by AES.ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments 
— Overall (Topic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which was designed to improve th
e recognition and measurement of financial instruments through targetedchanges to existing GAAP. The guidance requi
res equity investments (except those that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or result inconsolidation of the invest
ee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; that entities use the exit price notion whenmeasuring financial instrument
 fair values; that an entity separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financialasset on the Balance Sheets or Not
es to the financial statements; that an entity present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change inthe fair value of a liability re
sulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (or "own credit") when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fairvalue in accordance with 
the fair value option for financial instruments. Also, the standard eliminates the requirement for public entities to disclose the methodsand significant assumptions us
ed to estimate the fair value required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the Balance Sheets. Thestandard is effectiv
e beginning with interim periods starting after December 31, 2017 and cannot be applied early. The Company is currently evaluating theapplicability and materiality of t
he standard, but does not anticipate a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying th
e Accounting for Measurement-Period AdjustmentsIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, which simplifies 
the measurement-period adjustments in business combinations. It eliminates therequirement that an acquirer in
 a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. An acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during th
e period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment. The standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periodsbeginning after Decembe
r 15, 2015, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The new guidanceshould be applied prospective
ly to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this standard. The Company will adopt this standard onJanuary 1, 2016, which is not expected to h
ave a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.134

ASU No. 2015-15, Interest 
— Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) : Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated withLine-of-Credit Arrangements
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, which clarifies that the SEC Staf
f would not object to an entity presenting debt issuance costs related toline-of-credit arrangements as an
 asset that is subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are anyoutstanding borrowings on the line-o
f-credit arrangement. This standard should be adopted concurrent with adoption of ASU 2015-03 (see below). As ofDecember 31, 2015 
, the Company had deferred fin ancing costs related to lines-of-credit of approximately $2 million recorded within other current assets and $24million 
recorded within other noncurrent assets that would not be reclassif ied upon adoption of this standard.ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplify
ing the Measurement of InventoryIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, which simplifies the subsequent 
measurement of inventory. It replaces the current lower of cost or markettest with a lower of cost or ne
t realizable value test. The standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,and interim periods the
rein. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ofadopting the standard on its conso
lidated financial statements.ASU No. 2015-05, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other — Internal-Use Sof
tware (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a CloudComputing Arrangement
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, which clarifies how custome
rs in cloud computing arrangements should determine whether thearrangement includes a soft
ware license and eliminates the existing requirement for customers to account for software licenses they acquired by analogizing to theaccounting guidance on leas
es. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods therein. Earlyadoption is permitted. The s
tandard permits the use of a prospective or retrospective approach. The Company expects to utilize the prospective approach uponadoption of this standard, which is no
t expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.ASU No. 2015-03, Interest 
— Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, which simplifies the pres
entation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to arecognized debt liabi
lity be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Therecognition and measure
ment guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. The standard is effective for annual reportingperiods beginning after Dec
ember 15, 2015 and interim periods therein, and requires the use of the full retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted forfinancial statem
ents that have not been previously issued. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had deferred fin ancing costs of approximately $24 million classified within other 
current assets and $356 million classified within other non current assets that would be reclassified to reduce the related debt liabilities uponadoption of this standard.
ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation 
— Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (Topic 810)In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, which makes targeted 
amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted toinvestment companies f
rom applying the VIE guidance. The standard amends the evaluation of whether (1) fees paid to a decision-maker or service providersrepresent a variable interest, (
2) a limited partnership or similar entity has the characteristics of a VIE and (3) a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.The standard is effect
ive for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. Based on the Company'spreliminary analysis, no 
change in consolidation is expected although additional disclosures may be required.ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which clarifies princip
les for recognizing revenue and will result in a common revenue standard for U.S.GAAP and International Financial Repor
ting Standards. The objective of the new standard is to provide a single and comprehensive revenue recognition model forall contracts with custo
mers to improve comparability. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenueand timing of when it is recogn
ized. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount thatthe entity expects to be 
entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Eff
ective Date , which deferred the effe ctive date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, resulting in the new revenue standard beingeffective for annua
l reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. Early adoption is now permitted only as of the originaleffective date for public entities

. FAIR VALUEThe fair value of current fi
nancial assets and liabilities, debt service reserves and other deposits approximate their reported carrying amounts. The estimatedfair values of the Company's ass
ets and liabilities have been determined using available market information. By virtue of these amounts being estimates and basedon hypothetical transactio
ns to sell assets or transfer liabilities, the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effecton the estimated fai
r value amounts.Valuation Techniques 
— The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets andliabilities: (1) market approach,
 (2) income approach and (3) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from markettransactions involving iden
tical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single presentvalue amount. The measure
ment is based on current market expectations of the return on those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount thatwould currently be required 
to replace an asset. The Company measures its investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, inconnection with annual or even
t-driven impairment evaluations, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Theseinclude long-lived tangib
le assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment), goodwill and intangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights,etc.). In general, the Comp
any determines the fair value of investments and derivatives using the market approach and the income approach, respectively. In thenonrecurring measurements 
of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value estimated under the income approach isoften the most represen
tative of fair value.Investments 
— The Company's investments measur ed at fair value generally consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity securities are measured atfair value primarily using 
quoted market prices, which are considered Level 1 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. Debt securities primarily consist ofunsecured debentures, cer
tificates of deposit and government debt securities held by our Brazilian subsidiaries. Returns and pricing on these instruments aregenerally indexed to the CDI (Br
azilian equivalent to London Inter Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, a benchmark interest rate widely used by banks in the interbanklending market) or Seli
c (overnight borrowing rate) rates in Brazil. For the equity securities which are not considered Level 1 measurements and for the debtsecurities, fair value is determi
ned from comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets and are considered Level 2 measurements in the fair valuehierarchy.
Derivatives 
— Any Level 1 derivative instru ments are exchange-traded commodity futures for which the pricing is observable in active markets, and as such,these are not expected 
to transfer to other levels. There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.For all derivatives, with th
e exception of any classified as Level 1, the income approach is used, which consists of forecasting future cash flows based oncontractual notional 
amounts and applicable and available market data as of the valuation date. The most common market data inputs used in the income approachinclude volatiliti
es, spot and forward benchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR and Euro Inter Bank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR")), foreign exchange rates andcommodity prices. Forward ra
tes with the same tenor as the derivative instrument being valued are generally obtained from published sources, with these forwardrates being assessed quart
erly at a portfolio-level for reasonableness versus comparable published information provided from another source. When significantinputs are not observable, th
e Company uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression analysis or prices for similarly traded instrumentsavailable in the market.
For derivatives for which the
re is a standard industry valuation model, the Company uses a third-party derivative accounting and valuation service providerthat uses a standard model 
and observable inputs to estimate the fair value. For these derivatives, the Company performs analytical procedures and makescomparisons to other third
-party information in order to assess the reasonableness of the fair value. For derivatives for which there is not a standard industryvaluation model (such as PPAs and fuel supp
ly agreements that are derivatives or include embedded derivatives), the Company has created internal valuationmodels to estimate the fair val
ue, using observable data to the extent available. At each quarter-end, the models for the commodity and foreign currency-basedderivatives are gene
rally prepared and reviewed by employees who globally manage the respective commodity and foreign currency risks and are analyticallyreviewed independent of those 
employees.
Those cash flows are then discounted using the relevant spot benchmark interest rate (such as LIBOR or EURIBOR). The Company then makes a creditvaluation adjustment ("CVA") by fur
ther discounting the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on the observable or estimated debt spread of theCompany's subsidiary or its counterp
arty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument. The CVA for potential future scenarios in which the derivative is inan asset is based on the counte
rparty's credit ratings, credit default swap spreads, and debt spreads, as available. The CVA for potential future scenarios in whichthe derivative is a l
iability is based on the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's current debt spread. In the absence of readily obtainable credit information, theParent Company's or the subsidiary's es
timated credit rating (based on applying a standard industry model to historical financial information and then consideringother relevant infor
mation) and spreads of137

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
comparably rated ent
ities or the respective country's debt spreads are used as a proxy. All derivative instruments are analyzed individually and are subject to uniquerisk exposures.
The Company's methodology to fair va
lue its derivatives is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the published forward rates orprices may not extend through 
the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve, which necessitates the use ofunobservable inputs, such as proxy com
modity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve datawith respect to foreign ex
change contracts, beyond the traded points the Company utilizes the purchasing power parity approach to construct the remaining portionof the forward curve 
using relative inflation rates. In addition, in certain instances, there may not be market or market-corroborated data readily available, requiringthe use of unobservable inputs. Sim
ilarly, in certain instances, the spread that reflects the credit or nonperformance risk is unobservable requiring us to utilizeproxy yield curves of simil
ar credit quality. The fair value hierarchy of an asset or a liability is based on the level of significance of the input assumptions. An inputassumption is considered signi
ficant if it affects the fair value by at least 10%. Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 when the use of unobservable inputs issignificant. When the use o
f unobservable inputs is insignificant, assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. Transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 aredetermined as of the end o
f the reporting period and result from changes in significance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the CVA.Debt 
— Recourse and non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of recourse debt is estimated based on quoted market prices. The fair valueof non-recourse debt is est
imated differently based upon the type of loan. In general, the carrying amount of variable rate debt is a close approximation of its fairvalue. For fixed rate loans, 
the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow ("DCF") analyses. In the DCF analysis, the discount rateis based on the credit ra
ting of the individual debt instruments, if available, or the credit rating of the subsidiary. If the subsidiary's credit rating is not available, asynthetic credit ra
ting is determined using certain key metrics, including cash flow ratios and interest coverage, as well as other industry-specific factors. Forsubsidiaries located outs
ide the U.S., in the event that the country rating is lower than the credit rating previously determined, the country rating is used forpurposes of the DCF analysis. The fair va
lue of recourse and non-recourse debt excludes accrued interest at the valuation date. The fair value was determined usingavailable market 
information as of December 31, 2015 . The Company is not aware of any fac tors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts subsequentto 
December 31, 2015 . Nonrecurring Measurements 
— For nonrecurring measurements derived using the income approach, fair value is determined using valuation models based onthe principles of DCF. The income app
roach is most often used in the impairment evaluation of long-lived tangible assets, equity method investments, goodwill,and intangible assets. The Company us
es its internally developed DCF valuation models as the primary means to determine nonrecurring fair value measurementsthough other valuation approa
ches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting guidance are also considered. Depending on the complexity of avaluation, an independent va
luation firm may be engaged to assist management in the valuation process. A few examples of input assumptions to such valuationsinclude macroeconomi
c factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates and power and commodity prices. Whenever possible, theCompany attempts to obtain m
arket observable data to develop input assumptions. Where the use of market observable data is limited or not available for certaininput assumptions, the Company develops 
its own estimates using a variety of techniques such as regression analysis and extrapolations.For nonrecurring meas
urements derived using the market approach, recent market transactions involving the sale of identical or similar assets are considered.The use of this approach is li
mited because it is often difficult to identify sale transactions of identical or similar assets. This approach is used in impairmentevaluations of certa
in intangible assets. Otherwise, it is used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach.For nonrecurring measurem
ents derived using the cost approach, fair value is typically based upon a replacement cost approach. Under this approach, thedepreciated replacement cost of a
ssets is derived by first estimating the current replacement cost of assets and then applying the remaining useful life percentagesto such costs. Further adjustmen
ts for economic and functional obsolescence are made to the depreciated replacement cost. This approach involves a considerableamount of judgment, which is why its use 
is limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like the market approach, this approach is also used tocorroborate the fai
r value determined under the income approach.Fair Value Considerations 
— In determining fair v alue, the Company considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of the instrument, thecredit risk of the count
erparty and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria used to assess these factors are:138

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
Sources of market assumptions 
— The Company derives most of its m arket assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). Todetermine fair value, where mar
ket data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimatesof market assumptions.
Market liquidity 
— The Company evaluates marke t liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, is traded in anactive or inactive market. A
n active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market bid and ask quotes, themarket has a relat
ively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume and the market has a significant number of marketparticipants that wil
l allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without significantly affecting the market price. Another factor the Companyconsiders when determining wheth
er a market is active or inactive is the presence of government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult toestablish a market-b
ased price when entering into a transaction.Nonperformance risk 
— Nonperformance risk ref ers to the risk that an obligation will not be fulfilled and affects the value at which a liability is transferred oran asset is sold. Nonperformanc
e risk includes, but may not be limited to, the Company or its counterparty's credit and settlement risk. Nonperformance riskadjustments are dependent
 on credit spreads, letters of credit, collateral, other arrangements available and the nature of master netting arrangements. The Companyand its subsidiaries are p
arties to various interest rate swaps and options; foreign currency options and forwards; and derivatives and embedded derivatives, whichsubject the Company to nonperfor
mance risk. The financial and physical instruments held at the subsidiary level are generally non-recourse to the Parent Company.Nonperformance risk on the inv
estments held by the Company is incorporated in the fair value derived from quoted market data to mark the investments tofair value.

DP&L has certain over-the-

er credit rating from credit rating agencies. Since DP&L's rating has fallen below investment grade, certain of the counterparties to thederivative contracts have req
uested immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization of the mark-to-market loss (fair value excluding credit valuationadjustments), which was 
$28 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, for all deri vatives with credit risk-related contingentfeatures. As of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014 , DP&L had posted $8 million and $5 million , respectively, of cash co llateral directly with third parties and in abroker margin account and DP&L he
ld no cash collateral from counterparties to its derivative instruments that were in an asset position. After consideration of thenetting of counterparty 
assets, DP&L could have been required to, but did not, provide additional collateral of $2 million and $1 million as of December 31, 2015 and 
2014 , respectively. 7 
. FINANCING RECEIVABLESFinancing receivables are 
defined as receivables that have contractual maturities of greater than one year. The Company has financing receivables pursuant toamended agreements or gov
ernment resolutions that are due from certain Latin American governmental bodies, primarily in Argentina. The table below presentsthe breakdown of financing re
ceivables in millions by country as of the periods indicated:December 31,

 Represents non-contingent consideration to be received in 2016 from the sale of the Cameroon businesses in 2014. Balance is classified as short-term as of December 31, 2015. See Note 23 —Discontinued Operations. Argentina — 
Collection of the princip al and interest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to,the completion and opera
tion of power plants which generate cash for payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timing and amountof collections, and econom
ic conditions in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks including the credit ratings of the Argentine government on a quarterlybasis to assess the
 collectability of these receivables. The Company accrues interest on these receivables once the recognition criteria have been met. The
Company's collection estimates are based on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. Actual future cash flows could differ fromthese estimates.
FONINVEMEM Agreements
As a result of energy marke
t reforms in 2004 and 2010, AES Argentina entered into three agreements with the Argent ine government, referred to as theFONINVEMEM Agreements, to contribute a portion o
f their accounts receivable into a fund for financing the construction of combined cycle and gas-fired plants.These receivables accrue interest
 and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years once the related plan t begins operations. In addition, AES Argentinareceives an ownership inte
rest in these newly built plants once the receivables have been fully repaid.143

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
FONINVEMEM I and II 
— The receivables under the first two FONINVEMEM Agreements have been actively collected since the related plants commencedoperations in 2010. In assessing the 
collectability of the receivables under these agreements, the Company also considers how timely the collections havehistorically been made in acc
ordance with the agreements.FONINVEMEM III — 
The receivables rel ated to the third FONINVEMEM Agreement will not be repaid until commercial operation of the related gas-firedplant has been achieved. In 
assessing the collectability of the receivables under this agreement, the Company also considers the extent to which significantmilestones necessary to 
complete the plants have been achieved or are still probable.The FONINVEMEM receivables are denomina
ted in Argentine pesos, but indexed to U.S. Dollars, which represents a foreign currency derivative. As ofDecember 31, 2015 
and 2014 , the amount of the foreign currency-related derivative assets associated with the FONINVEMEM financing receivables that wereexcluded from the tabl
e above had a fair value of $292 million and $208 million , respectively. Other Agreements
In 2013, Resolution No. 95/2013 ("Resolution 95") which deve
loped a new energy regulatory framework that applies to all generation companies withcertain exceptions be
came effective. The new regulatory framework remunerates fixed and variable costs plus a margin that will depend on the technology and fuelused to generate the electricity
 and the installed capacity of each plant.In the fourth quarter of 2014, 
the Argentine government passed a resolution to contribute outstanding Resolution 95 receivables into a trust whereby AESArgentina has committed 
to install additional capacity into the system. CAMMESA will finance the investment utilizing the outstanding receivables as a guarantee.On July 10, 2015, the Argentine government pass
ed Resolution No. 482/2015 ("Resolution 482") which updated the prices of Resolution 529/2014retroactively to Febru
ary 1, 2015, and created a new trust called FONINVEMEM 2015-2018 in order to invest in new generation plants. AES Argentina and certainTermoandes units will rec
eive compensation under this program.8

 The Company's ownership in Guacolda is held through AES Gener, a 67% -owned consolidated subsidiary. AES Gener owns 50% of Guacolda, resulting in an AES effective ownership in Guacolda of 33% . At December 31, 2014, AES owned 
71% of AES Gener, resulting in an AES effective ownership in Guacolda of 35% . (3) 
 OPGC has one coal-fired expansion project under development. The project started construction in April 2014 and is currently expected to begin operations in 2018.Guacolda 
— On September 1, 2015, AES Gener and Global Infrast ructure Partners ("GIP") executed a restructuring of Guacolda that increased Guacolda'stax basis in certain long
-term assets and AES Gener's equity investment. This transaction was reflected within equity at the Guacolda level, but was not with oramong the shareholders of AES. According
ly, the AES proportion of the increased value in equity was recognized in net income. As a result, AES Gener recorded$66 million 
in net equity in earnings of affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2015, of which $46 million is attributable to The AES Corpora tion.On April 11, 2014, AES Gener undertook a series of tr
ansactions, pursuant to which AES Gener acquired the interests that it did not previously own inGuacolda for 
$728 million and simultaneously sold the ownersh ip interest to GIP for $730 million . The transaction provided GIP with subst antive participatingrights in Guacolda and, as a resu
lt, the Company continues to account for its investment in Guacolda using the equity method of accounting. At no time during thistransaction did the Company a
cquire a non-controlling interest. The cash paid for the acquisition is reflected in Acquisitions, net of cash acquired 144

and the cash proceeds from 
the sale of these ownership interests to GIP is reflected in Proceeds from the sale of businesses, ne t of cash sold on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the per
iod ended December 31, 2014.Distributed Energy 
— On February 18, 2015, the Company completed th e acquisition of 100% of the common stock of Main Str eet Power Company, Inc.,which has been renamed to Distr
ibuted Energy Inc. As part of this acquisition, the Company obtained additional investments accounted for under the equitymethod.
Silver Ridge Power 
— On July 1, 2014, the Puerto Rico solar business, Solar Power PR, LLC, was distr ibuted by Silver Ridge Power, LLC ("SRP") to AESand Riverstone Holdings LLC and was accounted fo
r as a direct equity method investment. On April 29, 2015, the Company purchased the remaining 50% of thecommon stock of Solar Power PR, LLC and now consolidates th
is entity. On July 2, 2014, the Company closed the sale of its 50% ownership interest in SRP for a purchase price of 
$179 million , excluding the Company's indirec t ownership interests in SRP's solar generation businesses in Italy and Spain ("Solar Italy" and"Solar Spain," respectively). Th
e buyer also had an option to purchase the Company's indirect 50% interest in the Ita ly solar generation business for an additionalconsideration of 
$42 million by August 2015. The buyer exercised its opt ion to purchase Solar Italy on August 31, 2015, and the sale was completed on October 1,2015.
In 2014, the sale of the Company's 
50% ownership interest in SRP did not qualify as a sale for accounting purposes as the Company had continuinginvolvement in the business ope
rations. As of July 2, 2014, the Company no longer retained an equity interest in SRP. As such, the then-remaining investmentbalance of 
$32 million related to Italy and Spa in and the AOCL balance of $40 million were reclassified to Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of 
December 31, 2014 , the carrying value of th ese investments recorded in Other noncurrent assets was $64 million . Solar Spain — 
On September 24, 2015, the Company complet ed the sale of Solar Spain, an equity method investment. Net proceeds from the sale transactionwere 
$31 million and the Company recognized a pr etax gain on sale of less than $1 million . Upon the completion of the Solar Spa
in and Solar Italy sale transactions noted above, the Company ceased its involvement in SRP's business operations andaccounted for these tr
ansactions as sales of real estate. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2015 , the carrying value of th ese investments recorded in Other noncurrent assets 
was zero . AES Barry Ltd. 
— The Company holds a 100% ownership interest in AES Barry Ltd. ("Bar ry"), a dormant entity in the U.K. that disposed of its generationand other operating assets. Due 
to a debt agreement, no material financial or operating decisions can be made without the banks' consent, and the Company doesnot control Barry. As of December 31, 
2015 and 2014 , other long-term liab ilities included $49 million and $52 million related to this debt agreement. Elsta 
— In 2014, long lived assets within Elst a were determined to not be recoverable and an impairment charge of approximately $82 million was recognized. The Company recogni
zed its 50% share, or $41 million , through its proportion of the equ ity earnings in Elsta.Entek 
— In September 2014, the Company execu ted an agreement, subject to the approval of the Company's Board of Directors, to sell its equity interest inAES Entek. Based on this agreement, during 
the third quarter of 2014, the Company determined there was an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of itsequity method investment 
in AES Entek and recognized a pretax impairment loss of $18 million in other non-operating expens e. On October 13, 2014, theCompany entered into a binding ag
reement to sell its 49.62% ownership interest in Entek fo r a purchase price of $125 million . This resulted in the recogn ition ofan additional other-than-temp
orary impairment of $68 million due to the inclusion of the cu mulative translation adjustment in the carrying value of the investment.For additional informat
ion see Note 9— Other Non-Operating Expense. The sale represents 100% of the Company's interest in ass ets in Turkey. On December 18,2014, the transaction closed whi
ch resulted in a final loss on sale of $4 million . Entek does not meet the cr iteria to be reported as discontinued operations underASU No. 2014-08, which was adopted by the Company on July 1, 2014. Accordingly, AES' proportion of En
tek's results are reflected in the ConsolidatedStatements of Operations with
in continuing operations. Excluding the loss on sale, Entek's pretax loss attributable to AES was $9 million and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, r

Both the gross carrying amount and the accumulated impairment losses of the Europe segment have been reduced by $58 million with no impact on the net carrying amount for the segment. This relates to Ebut e, which had fullyimpaired goodwill of 
$58 million and was sold in 2014. DP&L — 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test at its DP&L reporting unit ("DP&L") andrecognized a goodwill impa
irment expense of  $317 million . The reporting unit fail ed Step 1 as its fair value was less than its carrying amount, which wasprimarily due to a dec
rease in forecasted dark spreads that were driven by decreases in projected forward power prices, and lower than expected revenues from anew Capacity Performance ("CP") produ
ct. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined under the income approach using a discounted cash flow valuationmodel. The significant assu
mptions included within the discounted cash flow valuation model were forward commodity price curves, the amount of non-bypassable charges from th
e pending ESP, expected revenues from the new CP product, and planned environmental expenditures. In Step 2, goodwill wasdetermined to have an implie
d negative fair value after the hypothetical purchase price allocation under the accounting guidance for business combinations;therefore, a full i
mpairment of the remaining goodwill balance of $317 million was recognized. DP&L is reported in the US SBU reportable segment.Main Street Power 
— During the first quarter o f 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the common stock of Main Str eet PowerCompany, Inc. The transaction in
cluded recognition of $16 million of Goodwill. See Note 25 — Acquisitions for additional information. Buffalo Gap — 
During the first quarter o f 2014, the Company recognized an $18 million impairment of its goodwil l at its Buffalo Gap reporting unit, whichis comprised of 
three wind projects in Texas. During the fou rth quarter of 2014, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test at its Buffalo Gapreporting unit. The report
ing unit failed Step 1 and Step 2 was performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment. In Step 2, after the hypothetical purchaseprice allocation unde
r the relevant accounting guidance, the implied fair value of goodwill was negative. As a result, a full impairment of goodwill of $10 million was recognized. Buffalo Gap is repo
rted in the US SBU reportable segment.DPLER 
— During the first quarter o f 2014, the Company performed an interim impairment test on the $136 million in goodwill at its DPLER reporting unit, a competitive ret
ail marketer selling retail electricity to customers in Ohio and Illinois. The DPLER reporting unit was identified as being "at risk" during the fourthquarter of 2013. T
he impairment indicators arose based on market information available regarding actual and proposed sales of competitive retail marketers, whichindicated a signific
ant decline in valuations during the first quarter of 2014.In Step 1 of the interim i
mpairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying amount under both the marketapproach and the income app
roach using a discounted cash flow valuation model. The significant assumptions included commodity price curves, estimatedelectricity to be d
emanded by its customers, changes in its customer base through attrition and expansion, discount rates, the assumed tax structure and the level ofworking capital required 
to run the business. In Step 2 of the interim i
mpairment test, the goodwill was determined to have an implied fair value of  zero  after the hypothetical purc hase price allocationand the Company accordingly re
cognized a full impairment of the $136 million in goodwill at the DPLER reporting unit. DPLER is repor ted in the US SBUreportable segment.

Recoverable or refundable per Brazilian N ational Electric Energy Agency ("ANEEL") regulations through the Annual Tariff Adjustment ("IRT"). These costs are generally non-controllable and primarily consist of purchasedelectricity, energy transmission, and sector costs that are considered volatile. 
The costs are passed through for a period of 12 months as part of the IRT. Any remaining balance is considered in the subsequent IRT, which results ina total of 
24 months to recover or refund the costs. Favorable spot market sales are also subject to customer refunds through the IRT over the course of these time periods.(2)
Deferred fuel costs incurred by our El Salvador subsidiaries associated with purchase of energy from th e El Salvador spot market and power generation plants. In El Salvador, the deferred fuel adjustment represents the variancebetween the actual fuel costs and the fuel costs recover
ed in the tariffs. The variance is recovered quarterly in the tariff reset period.(3)
Includes assets with and without a rate of return. Other current regulatory assets that did not earn a rate of return were $8 million and $22 million , as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Other noncurrent regulatory assets that did not earn a rate of return were 
$237 million and $73 million , as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Other current and noncurrent regulatory assets primarily consist of: ▪
Unamortized losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed in prior periods at IPL and DPL, which are amortized over the lives of the original issues in accordance with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission("FERC") and PUCO rules.
▪
Unamortized carrying charges and certain other costs related to Petersburg unit 4 at IPL.
▪Deferred storm costs incurred primarily in 2008 to repair storm damage at DPL; recovery w as approved via order from the PUCO on December 17, 2014 and began January 2015.▪
Additional Regulatory Asset Base ("RAB") from a favorable decision on tariff reset ( administrative appeal) at Eletropaulo.(4)
Past expenditures on which the Company does not earn a rate of return. (5)
The regulatory accounting standards allow the defined pension and postretir ement benefit obligation to be recorded as a regulatory asset equal to the previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs thatare expected to be recovered through future r
ates. Pension expense is recognized based on the plan's actuarially determined pension liability. Recovery of costs is probable, but not yet determined. Pension contributions made byour Brazilian subsidiaries are not included in regulatory assets as those contributions are not covered by th
e established tariff in Brazil.(6)
Probable recovery through future rates, based upon established regulatory practi ces, which permit the recovery of current taxes. This amount is expected to be recovered,149

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
without interest, over the period as book-tax temporary differences reverse 
and become current taxes.(7)
Transmission service costs and other administrative costs from IPL's participation in the Midwest ISO market, which are recover able but do not earn a rate of return. Recovery of costs is probable, but the timing is not yetdetermined.
(8)
In July 2012, the Brazilian energy regulator (the "Regulator") approved the periodic review and reset of a component of Eletropaulo's regulated tariff, which determines the margin to be earned by Eletropaulo. The review andreset of this tariff component was retroactive to July 2011 and applied to customers' invoices from July 2012 to June 2015. From July 2011 through June 2012, Eletropaulo invoiced 
customers under the then-existing tariff rate, asrequired by the Regulator. As the new tariff rate was lower than the pr
evious rate, Eletropaulo was required to reduce customer tariffs for the difference over the next year. Accordingly, from July 2011 through June 2012,Eletropaulo recognized a regulatory liability for the 
estimated future refunds, subsequently adjusted as of June 30, 2012 upon the finalization of the new tariff with the Regulator. The refund to customers was considered in the2013 tariff adjustment, which contemplated an amortization of 
67.55% from July 4, 2013. The remaining balance, representing 32.45% , was considered in the next annual tariff adjustment. There was no recorded currentregulatory liability at Eletropaulo as of 
December 31, 2015 . (9)
Amounts received for costs expected to be incurred to improve the effi ciency of our plants in Brazil as part of the IRT.(10)
Other current and noncurrent regulatory liabilities primarily consist of liabilities owed to el ectricity generators due to variance in energy prices during rationing periods ("Free Energy"). Our Brazilian subsidiaries are authorizedto refund this cost associated with monthly energy price variances between th
e wholesale energy market prices owed to the power generation plants producing Free Energy and the capped price reimbursed by the localdistribution companies which are passed through to the final customers through energy tariffs. The balan
ce excludes asset retirement obligations that were reclassified out of Other.(11)
Obligations for removal costs which do not have an associated legal retirement oblig ation as defined by the accounting standards on asset retirement obligations.(12)
Obligations established by ANEEL in Brazil associated with electric utility concessions and represent amounts received from customers or donations not subject to return. These donations are allocated to support energy networkexpansion and to improve utility operations to meet customers' needs. The term of the obligation is established by AN
EEL. Settlement shall occur when the concession ends.(13) 
 Represents adjustments to the RAB resulting from an administrative ruling in December 2013 compelling Eletropaulo to refund customers beginning July 2014.The current regulatory 
assets and liabilities are recorded in Other current assets and Accrued and other liabilities , respectively, on the ac companyingConsolidated Balance Sheets. The noncu

e limited to subsidiary activity and vary among the subsidiaries. These covenants may include, but are not limited to, maintenance ofcertain reserves and financial rati
os, minimum levels of working capital and limitations on incurring additional indebtedness.As of December 31, 
2015 and 2014 , approximately $513 million and $245 million , respectively, of rest ricted cash was maintained in accordance withcertain covenants of th
e non-recourse debt agreements, and these amounts were included within Restricted cash and Debt service reserves and other deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Balan
ce Sheets.Various lender and government
al provisions restrict the ability of certain of the Company's subsidiaries to transfer their net assets to the Parent Company.Such restricted net asse
ts of subsidiaries amounted to approximately $2 billion at December 31, 2015 . The following table summar
izes the Company's subsidiary non-recourse debt in default (in millions) as of December 31, 2015 . Due to the defaults, these amounts are included in th

  $1,038   As of 
December 31, 2015 , none of the defaults are p ayment defaults. All of the subsidiary non-recourse defaults were triggered by failure to comply withother covenants and/or condi
tions such as (but not limited to) failure to meet information covenants, complete construction or other milestones in an allocated time,meet certain minimum or maximum fina
ncial ratios, or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents of the applicable subsidiary.In the event that there is
 a default, bankruptcy or maturity acceleration at a subsidiary or group of subsidiaries that meets the applicable definition ofmateriality under 
the corporate debt agreements of The AES Corporation, there could be a cross-default to the Company's recourse debt. Materiality is defined inthe Parent's senior secured 
credit facility as having provided 20% or more of the Parent Company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four mostrecently completed fiscal

quarters. As of 
December 31, 2015 , none of the defaults list ed above individually or in the aggregate result in or are at risk of triggering a cross-default under therecourse debt of the Paren
t Company. In the event the Parent Company is not in compliance with the financial covenants of its senior secured revolving creditfacility, restri
cted payments will be limited to regular quarterly shareholder dividends at the then-prevailing rate. Payment defaults and bankruptcy defaults wouldpreclude the making of any 
restricted payments.Interest Expense 
— Interest expense for th e year ended December 31, 2015 was reduced by $64 million related to the reversal of a m onetary correctionpreviously recognized as in
terest expense at Eletropaulo. This interest expense was on a contingent regulatory liability that was also reversed in the current period.Interest expense for th
e year ended December 31, 2014 was reduced by approximately $48 million related to reversing contingent interest accruals associated withdisputed purchased energy oblig
ations at Sul for which it was determined, based on developments during 2014, that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome forthe payment of interes
t on the disputed obligations was no longer probable. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was reduced by approximately$34 million 
related to the recogn ition of ineffectiveness on derivative interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges.RECOURSE DEBT

IES — In 1999, AES Trust III, a wholly-owned special pu rpose business trust and a VIE, issued approximately10.35 million 
of $50 par value Term Convertible Preferred Securities ("TECONS") with a quarterly coupon payment of $0.844 for total proceeds of $517 million and concurrently purchased 
$517 million of 6.75%  Junior Subordinated Convertible Deben tures due 2029 (the "6.75% Debentures") issued by AES. The Companyconsolidates AES Trust III in its 
consolidated financial statements and classifies the TECONS as recourse debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company'sobligations under the 
6.75%  Debentures and other relev ant trust agreements, in aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of theTECON Trusts' obligations. As of December 31, 
2015 and 2014 , the sole assets of AES Trust III a re the 6.75%  Debentures. AES, at its option, can redeem th
e 6.75%  Debentures which would result in the required redemption of the TECONS issued by AES Trust III, currently for$50 
per TECON. The TECONS must be redeemed upon maturity of the 6.75%  Debentures. The TECONS are convertible in to the common stock of AES at eachholder's option prior to October 15, 2029 
at the rate of 1.4216 , representing a conversion p rice of $35.17 per share. The maximum numb er of shares of commonstock AES would be required to issue should al
l holders decide to convert their securities would be 14.7 million shares. Dividends on the TECONS are payable quarter
ly at an annual rate of 6.75% . The Trust is permitted to d efer payment of dividends for up to 20  consecutivequarters, provided that th
e Company has exercised its right to defer interest payments under the corresponding debentures or notes. During such deferral periods,dividends on the TECONS would accumulate quart
erly and accrue interest, and the Company may not declare or pay dividends on its common stock. AES has notexercised the option to de
fer any dividends at this time and all dividends due under the Trust have been paid.13

. CONTINGENCIESGuarantees, Letters of Credit — 
In connection with certa in project financing, acquisition and dispositions, power purchase and other agreements, theParent Company has expressly undert
aken limited obligations and commitments, most of which will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence offuture events. In the norm
al course of business, the Parent Company has entered into various agreements, mainly guarantees and letters of credit, to providefinancial or perfor
mance assurance to third parties on behalf of AES businesses. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance thecreditworthiness otherwise 
achieved by a business on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the availability of sufficient credit to accomplish their intendedbusiness purposes. Most of the contingen
t obligations relate to future performance commitments which the Company or its businesses expect to fulfill within thenormal course of business. The exp
iration dates of these guarantees vary from less than one year to more than 19 years.The following table summar
izes the Parent Company's contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 . Amounts presented in the tabl e belowrepresent the Parent Company's 
current undiscounted exposure to guarantees and the range of maximum undiscounted potential exposure. The maximum exposureis not reduced by the amounts, i
f any, that could be recovered under the recourse or collateralization provisions in the guarantees. The amounts include obligationsmade by the Parent Company for th
e direct benefit of the lenders associated with the non-recourse debt of its businesses of $14 million . Contingent Contractual Obligations

Excludes normal and customary representations and warranties in agreements for the sale of assets (including ownership in associated legal entities) where the associated risk is considered to be nominal.
As of December 31, 2015 , the Parent Company had no commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related equipment that werenot included in the lett
ers of credit discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 0.2% to 2.5% per annum on the outstanding amoun
ts of letters of credit.Environmental — 
The Company periodically rev iews its obligations as they relate to compliance with environmental laws, including site restoration andremediation. As of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014 the Company had recognized li abilities of $10 million and $12 million , respectively, for proj ected environmentalremediation costs. Due to th
e uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future costs of compliance or remediation could behigher or lower than the amoun
t currently accrued. Moreover, where no liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that the Company may be requiredto incur remediation 
costs or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2015 . In aggregate, the Company estimates that the range of 
potential losses related to environmental matters, where estimable, to be up to $1 million . The amounts considered reason ably possibledo not include amounts accru
ed as discussed above.Litigation — 
The Company is involved in certa in claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company accrues for litigationand claims when it is probabl
e that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has evaluated claims inaccordance with the ac
counting guidance for contingencies that it deems both probable and reasonably estimable and, accordingly, has recorded aggregateliabilities for all claims of appr
oximately $189 million and $199 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. These amoun ts are reported on theConsolidated Balance Sheets within 
Accrued and other liabiliti es and Other noncurrent liabilities . A significant portion of thes e accrued liabilities relate toemployment, non-income t
ax and customer disputes in international jurisdictions (principally Brazil). Certain of the Company's subsidiaries, principally in Brazil,are defendants in a numbe
r of labor and employment lawsuits. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other relief. Thesubsidiaries have denied any 
liability and intend to vigorously defend themselves in all of these proceedings. There can be no assurance that these accruedliabilities will be 
adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise.The Company believes, based upon infor
mation it currently possesses and taking into account established accruals for liabilities and its insurance coverage,that the ultimate ou
tcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. However,where no accrued liabil
ity has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require theCompany to pay damages or make exp
enditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2015 . The material contingencies where a loss is reasonably possibl
e primarily include claims under financing agreements; disputes with offtakers, suppliers and EPC contractors; alleged violationof monopoly laws and regulations; 
income tax and non-income tax matters with tax authorities; and regulatory matters. In aggregate, the Company estimates thatthe range of potential 
losses, where estimable, related to these reasonably possible material contingencies to be between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion . The amounts considered reasonably possibl
e do not include amounts accrued, as discussed above. These material contingencies do not include income tax-related contingencieswhich are considered part o
f our uncertain tax positions.Regulatory 
— During 2013, the Company recognized a r egulatory liability of $269 million for a contingency rela ted to an administrative ruling whichrequired Eletropaulo to 
refund customers' amounts related to the regulatory asset base. In 2014, Eletropaulo started refunding customers as part of the tariff. InJanuary 2015, ANEEL updated the tariff 
to exclude any further customer refunds. On June 30, 2015, ANEEL included in the tariff reset the reimbursement toEletropaulo of these amoun
ts previously refunded to customers to begin in July 2015. During 2015, as a result of favorable events, management reassessed thecontingency and determin
ed that it no longer meets the recognition criteria under ASC 450 — Contingencies . Management believes th at it is now only reasonablypossible that Eletropaulo wi
ll have to refund these amounts to customers. Accordingly, the Company reversed the remaining regulatory liability for thiscontingency of 
$161 million in 2015, which increased Regulated Revenue by $97 million and reduced Interest Expense by $64 million . Amounts related to this case are now included

. BENEFIT PLANSDefined Contribution Plan 
— The Company sponsors four defined contribution plans ("the Plans"). Two are for U.S. non-union employees, of which one is foremployees of the Parent Company 
and certain U.S. SBU businesses and one is for DPL employees. One plan includes both union and non-union e mployees at IPL.One 
defined contribution plan is for union employees at DPL. The Plans are qualified under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. All U.S. employees of theCompany are eligible to pa
rticipate in the appropriate Plan except for those employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless suchagreement specifi
cally provides that the employee is considered an eligible employee under a Plan. The Plans provide matching contributions in AES commonstock or cash, other contribu
tions at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in AES common stock or cash and discretionary taxdeferred contributions 
from the participants. Participants are fully vested in their own contributions and the Company's matching contributions. Participants vest inother company contributions 
ratably over a five -year period ending on the fifth anniversary of their hire date. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company's contributions to the def
ined contribution plans were approximately $18 million , and for the years ended Dece mber 31, 2014 and 2013 , contributions were 
$22 million and $23 million per year, respectively. Defined Benefit Plans 
— Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees.Pension benefits are based on ye
ars of credited service, age of the participant and average earnings. Of the 33 active defined benefit plans as of December 31, 2015 , 
5 are at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries  . The following table reconc

A U.S. subsidiary of the Company has defined benefit obligations of $6 million and $748 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, for which salary bands, rather than rates of compensation incr eases, are used todetermine future benefit costs. Rates of compensation increases in the tabl
e above do not include amounts related to these specific defined benefit plans. A plan with a defined benefit obligation of $742 million at December 31, 2014 and which used salary bands at that date is using a rate of compensation incre
ase as at December 31, 2015. The rate of compensation increase for this plan is included in the weighted average in the above table forcalculating the benefit obligation as at Decemb
er 31, 2015, but is not included in the weighted average for calculating the benefit obligation as at December 31, 2014 or the periodic benefit cost for 2014 or 2015.(2) 
 Includes an inflation factor that is used to calculate future periodic benefit cost, but is not used to calculate the benefit obligation.The Company establishes its est
imated long-term return on plan assets considering various factors, which include the targeted asset allocation percentages,historic returns and expe
cted future returns.The measurement of pension ob
ligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions. These assumptions include estimates of the presentvalue of projected futu
re pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases anddemographic experienc
e. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.The assumptions used in developing th
e required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates; salary growth; retirement rates; inflation;expected return on plan
 assets; and mortality rates.The effects of actual results
 differing from the Company's assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect theCompany's recognized expense in such 
future periods.Effective January 1, 2016 the Comp
any will apply a disaggregated discount rate approach for determining service cost and interest cost for its defined benefitpension plans and post-retir
ement plans in the U.S. and U.K. Refer to Note 1 — General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information relating to this change 
in estimate.Sensitivity of the Company's pension fund
ed status to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assetsassumptions is shown below. Note that these s
ensitivities may be asymmetric and are specific to the base conditions at year-end 2015 . They also may not be additive, so the impact o
f changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. The funded status as ofDecember 31, 
2015 is affected by the assump tions as of that date. Pension expense for 2015 is affected by the Dece mber 31, 2014 assumptions. The impact on pension expense from a one per
centage point change in these assumptions is shown in the table below (in millions):Increase of 1% in the discount rate

. EQUITYEquity Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests
Brazil Reorganization 
— In 2015, the Company completed a r estructuring of AES Brasiliana. This transaction resulted in no change of ownership or control.The 
$27 million impact of this equity tran saction was recognized in additional paid-in capital.Gener 
— On November 18, 2015, the Company sold a 4% stake in AES Gener S.A. ("Gener") through its 99.9% owned subsidiary inversions Cachagua S.p.A ("Cachagua") for 
$145 million , net of transaction costs. Th e sale was of previously issued common shares of Gener to certain institutional investors and isnot a sale of in-substance 
real estate. While the sale decreased Parent ownership interest from 70.7% to 66.7% , the Parent continues to re tain its controllingfinancial interest in the su
bsidiary. The difference of $24 million between the fair value o f the consideration received, net of taxes and transaction costs, and theamount by which the NCI is adjusted was re
cognized in additional paid-in capital. No pretax gain or loss was recognized in net income as a result of this
transaction.158

Jordan 
— On March 15, 2015, the Company executed an ag reement to sell 40% of its interest in a wholly -owned subsidiary in Jordan that owns a controllinginterest in the Jordan IPP4 gas-
fired plant for $30 million . The sale was completed on Februa ry 18, 2016. See Note 30 — Subsequent Events for further information.
IPALCO 
— In February 2015, La Caisse de depot et p lacement du Quebec ("CDPQ") purchased 15% of AES US Investment, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary that owns 
100% of IPALCO Enterprises, Inc. ("IPALCO"), for $247 million , with an option to invest an addit ional $349 million in IPALCO through 2016 in exchange for a 
17.65% equity stake. In April 2015, CDPQ invested $214 million of the $349 million in IPALCO, which resulted in CDPQ's combined equity interest in IPALCO to be 
24.90% . Upon investing the remaining co mmitment of $135 million , CDPQ's equity interests in IPALCO will total 30% . As a result of these transa
ctions, $84 million in taxes and transaction costs were recognized as a net decrease to equity. The Company also recognized anincrease of 
$377 million to additional paid-in c apital and a reduction to retained earnings of $377 million for the excess of the fa ir value of the shares over theirbook value. Since the noncontroll
ing interest is contingently redeemable, the fair value of the consideration received of $460 million , net of proportional dividends, is classified in 
temporary equity as redeemable stock of subsidiaries on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. No gain or loss was recognized in net incomeas the sale was not considered 
to be a sale of in-substance real estate. Any subsequent adjustments to allocate earnings and dividends to CDPQ will be classified asnoncontrolling interest wi
thin permanent equity and adjustments to the amount in temporary equity will occur only if and when it is probable that the shares willbecome redeemable. As th
e Company maintained control after the sale, IPALCO continues to be accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary within the US SBUreportable segment.
Dominican Republic 
— In December 2014 Estrella and Linda Groups, an investor-based group in the Dominican Republic acquired 8% noncontrollinginterest in our businesses in 
the Dominican Republic for $83 million , net of transaction costs, wi th options to acquire an additional 2% for $24 million at any time between the closing date and De
cember 31, 2015, and an additional 10% for $125 million at any time between the closing date and December 31, 2016. InDecember 2015, Estrella and L
inda Groups exercised its first call option of additional 2% for $18 million , net of discount and transac tion costs. This resulted inEstrella and Linda Groups having a 
total of 10% noncontrolling interest in our businesses in the Dominican Republic.As a result of these transa
ctions, $29 million and $7 million , net of taxes and transac tion costs, was recognized in additional paid-in capital at December 31,2014 and 2015, respectively. No gain or loss was 
recognized in net income as the sale is not considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate. As the Companymaintained control a
fter the sale, our businesses in the Dominican Republic continue to be consolidated by the Company within the MCAC SBU reportablesegment.
Masinloc 
— On June 25, 2014, the Company executed an agre ement to sell approximately 45% of its interest in Masin -AES Pte Ltd., a wholly-ownedsubsidiary that owns the Company's business in
terests in the Philippines, for $453 million , subject to certain pur chase price adjustments. On July 15, 2014, theCompany completed the Masinlo
c sale transaction and received cumulative net proceeds of $436 million , including $23 million contingent upon the achieve mentof certain restructuring efficiencies
. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of in-substance real estate. Noncontrolling interest of $130 million and a pretax gain on sale of investment o
f approximately $283 million , net of transaction costs, we re recognized during the third quarter of 2014. The portion of the proceedsrelated to the conting
ency has been deferred.After completion of the s
ale, the Company owns a 51% net ownership interest in Mas inloc and will continue to manage and operate the plant, with 41% owned by Electricity Genera
ting Public Company Limited and 8% owned by the International Finance Corporation. As the Company maintained control after thesale, Masinloc continues to b

. SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATIONThe segment reporting stru
cture uses the Company's organizational structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages the businesses internally,and is organized by geographic 
regions which provide better socio-political-economic understanding of our business. The Company is organized by six SBUs ledby our President and Chief Executiv
e Officer: US, Andes, Brazil, MCAC, Europe, and Asia SBUs. Using the accounting guidance on segment reporting, theCompany determined that i
t has six operating and six reportable segments corresponding to its SBUs.Corporate and Other 
— Corporate overhead costs which a re not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments are included in"Corporate and Other." Also included a
re certain intercompany charges such as self-insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation.The Company uses Adjusted PTC as its primary seg
ment performance measure. Adjusted PTC, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as pretaxincome from continuing ope
rations attributable to AES excluding unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains orlosses, gains or losses due to disposit
ions and acquisitions of business interests, losses due to impairments and costs due to the early retirement of debt. TheCompany has concluded that Adjusted PTC best r
eflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in theCompany's internal evaluat
ion of the financial performance of its segments. Additionally, given its large number of businesses and complexity, the Companyconcluded that Adjusted PTC is a more 
transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company'sresults.    
Revenue and Adjusted PTC before interseg
ment eliminations includes the effect of intercompany transactions with other segments except for interest,charges for certain management fee
s, and the write-off of intercompany balances, as applicable. All intra-segment activity has been eliminated within the segment.Inter-segment activity has bee
n eliminated within the total consolidated results.The following tables present

. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONSTOCK OPTIONS 
— AES grants options to purchase shares of common stock under stock option plans to employees and non-employee directors. Underthe terms of the plans, th
e Company may issue options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to 100% of the market price at the date the option is granted. Stock options 
are generally granted based upon a percentage of an employee's base salary. Stock options issued under these plans in 2015 , 2014 
and 2013 have a three -year vesting schedule and v est in one-third increments over the three -year period. The stock options h ave a contractual term of ten years. At December 31, 
2015 , approximately 16 million shares were remaining fo r award under the plans. In all circumstances, stock options granted by AES donot entitle the holder 
the right, or obligate AES, to settle the stock option in cash or other assets of AES.The following table presents 
the weighted average fair value of each option grant and the underlying weighted average assumptions, as of the grant date,using the Black-Scholes option-pr

The Company initially recogn
izes compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. In2015 
, AES has estimated a weighted ave rage forfeiture rate of 15.28% for stock options granted in 2015 . This estimate will be r evised if subsequent informationindicates that the actual num
ber of instruments forfeited is likely to differ from previous estimates. Based on the estimated forfeiture rate, the Company expects toexpense 
$3.3 million on a straight-line basis ov er a three year period (approximately $1.1 million per year) related to stock options granted during the year endedDecember 31, 
2015 . RESTRICTED STOCK
Restricted Stock Units 
— The Company issues restricted s tock units ("RSUs") under its long-term compensation plan. The RSUs are generally grantedbased upon a percentage of th
e participant's base salary. The units have a three -year vesting schedule and v est in one-third increments over the three -year period. Units granted prior to 2011 are 
required to be held for an additional two years before they can be converted into shares, and thus become transferable. There is nosuch requirement for uni
ts granted in 2011 and afterwards. In all circumstances, restricted stock units granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or obligateAES, to settle the restric
ted stock unit in cash or other assets of AES.For the years ended December 31, 
2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , RSUs issued had a grant date fair va lue equal to the closing price of the Company's stock on thegrant date. The Company does not discoun
t the grant date fair values to reflect any post-vesting restrictions. RSUs granted to employees during the years endedDecember 31, 
2015 , 2014 , and 2013 had grant date fair va lues per RSU of $12.03 , $14.60 and $11.19 , respectively. The following table summar

, AES has estimated a weighted ave rage forfeiture rate of 13.53% for RSUs granted in 2015 . This estimate will be r evised if subsequent information indicatesthat the actual numbe
r of instruments forfeited is likely to differ from previous estimates. Based on the estimated forfeiture rate, the Company expects to expense$16 million 
on a straight-line basis ov er a three year period related to RSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2015 . The table below summariz
es the RSUs that vested and were converted during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 (number of RSUs in thousands):

 1,238  1,734  905 Shares withheld for taxes
 549  796  407 Performance Stock Units 
— The Company issues performance s tock units ("PSUs") to officers under its long-term compensation plan. PSUs are restrictedstock units of which 
50% of the units awarded include a market condition and the remaining 50% include a performanc e condition. Vesting will occur if theapplicable continued e
mployment conditions are satisfied and (a) for the units subject to the market condition the Total Stockholder Return ("TSR") onAES common stock exceeds the TSR of the Standa
rd and Poor's 500 Utilities Sector Index over the three -year measurement p eriod beginning on January 1 of thegrant year and ending on Decemb
er 31 of the third year and (b) for the units subject to the performance condition if the Company's actual Adjusted EBITDA meetsthe performance target over the 
three -year measurement p eriod beginning on January 1 of the grant year and ending on December 31 of the third year. The marketand performance condit
ions determine the vesting and final share equivalent per PSU and can result in earning an award payout range of 0% to 200% , depending on the achievement. In a
ll circumstances, PSUs granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the restricted stock unit in cash orother assets of AES.
The effect of the ma
rket condition on PSUs issued to officers of the Company during 2015 is reflected in the award's fair value on the grant date. The resultsof the valuation estimated t
he fair value at $8.22 per share, equating to 69% of the Company's closing stock pric e on the date of grant. PSUs that included a marketcondition granted during the y
ear ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 had a grant date fair v alue per RSU of $8.22 , $15.19 and $13.28 , respectively. The fair value of the PSUs with a perfo
rmance condition had a grant date fair value of $11.89 equal to the closing pric e of the Company's stock on the grant date. TheCompany believes that it is p
robable that the performance condition will be met; this will continue to be evaluated throughout the performance period. If the fairvalue of the market cond
ition was not applied to PSUs issued to officers, the total grant date fair value of PSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2015 would have increased by 
$1.1 million . Restricted stock units with a 
market condition awarded to officers of the Company prior to 2011 contained only the market condition measuring the TSR onAES common stock. These units were requi
red to be held for an additional two years subsequent to vesting before they could be converted into shares and becometransferable. There 
is no such requirement for the shares granted during 2011 and afterwards.165

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
Buffalo Gap III 
— During 2015, the Company tested the re coverability of its long-lived assets at Buffalo Gap III, a wind farm in Texas. Impairmentindicators were identi
fied based on a decline in forward power curves coupled with the near term expiration of favorable contracted cash flows. The Companydetermined that the 
carrying amount was not recoverable. The Buffalo Gap III asset group was determined to have a fair value of $118 million using the income approach. As a result, the Company r
ecognized asset impairment expense of $116 million . Buffalo Gap III is reported in the US SBU reportable segment.U.K. Wind (Development Projects) 
— During 2015, the Company decided to no longer pu rsue two wind projects in the U.K. based on recent regulatoryclarifications specific to these 
projects, resulting in a full impairment. Impairment indicators were also identified at four other wind projects based on the ir currentdevelopment status and a r
eassessment of the likelihood that each project would be pursued given aviation concerns, regulatory changes, economic considerationsand other factors. The Company de
termined that the carrying amounts of each of these asset groups, which totaled $38 million , were not recoverable. In aggregate,the asset groups were deter
mined to have a fair value of $1 million using the market approach and, as a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expenseof 
$37 million . The U.K. Wind (Development Projects) are reported in the Europe SBU reportable segment.Ebute 
— During 2014, the Company identified i mpairment indicators at Ebute in Nigeria, resulting from the continued lack of gas supply, the increasedlikelihood of selling the 
asset group before the end of its useful life, and indications about the potential proceeds that could be received from a future sale. TheCompany determined that th
e carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The Company recognized asset impairment of $67 million , which represents the difference betwe
en the carrying amount of $103 million and fair value less cost to sell of $36 million . In November 2014, the Company complet ed the sale ofits interest in Ebute. See Not
e 24 — Dispositions for additional detai ls. Prior to its sale, Ebute was reported in the Europe SBU reportable segment.U.K. Wind (Newfield) 
— During 2014, the Company tested the re coverability of long-lived assets at its Newfield wind development project in the U.K. aftertheir government refus
ed to grant a permit necessary for the project to continue. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was notrecoverable. The Newfield 
asset group was determined to have no fair value using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized asset impairmentexpense of 
$12 million . U.K. Wind (Newfield) is reported in the Europe SBU reportable segment.East Bend (DP&L) 
— During 2014, the Company identified i mpairment indicators at East Bend, a coal-fired plant in Ohio jointly owned by DP&L, resultingfrom the increased l
ikelihood that the asset group would be disposed prior to the end of its useful life. The Company determined that the carrying amount of theasset group was not recoverabl
e. The East Bend asset group was determined to have a fair value of $2 million using the market approach, and the Companyrecognized asset impa
irment expense of $12 million . The Company's interest in East Bend was sold in December 2014. Prior to its sale, East Bend was reported inthe US SBU reportable segment.
Beaver Valley 
— During 2013, Beaver Valley, a wholly-owned coa l-fired plant in Pennsylvania, entered into an agreement to early terminate its PPA withthe offtaker in exchang
e for a lump-sum payment of $60 million . The termination of the PPA resul ted in a significant reduction in the future cash flows of the assetgroup and was considered an impai
rment indicator. The carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The carrying amount of the asset group exceededthe fair value of the 
asset group, resulting in asset impairment expense of $46 million . Beaver Valley is reported in the US SBU reportable segment.Conesville (DP&L) 
— During 2013, the Company tested the re coverability of long-lived assets at Conesville, a coal-fired plant in Ohio jointly-owned byDP&L. Gradual decreases in power pri
ces as well as lower estimates of future capacity prices in conjunction with the DP&L reporting unit failing Step 1 of theannual goodwill impairme
nt test were determined to be impairment indicators. The Company performed a long-lived asset impairment test and determined that thecarrying amount of the ass
et group was not recoverable. The Conesville asset group was determined to have zero fair value using discounted cash flows under theincome approach. As a result, 
the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $26 million . Conesville is reported in th e US SBU reportable segment.Itabo (San Lorenzo) 
— During 2013, the Company tested the re coverability of long-lived assets at San Lorenzo, a LNG fueled plant of Itabo. Itabo wasinformed by Super-Intendenc
ia de Electridad ("SIE"), the system regulator in the Dominican Republic, that it would not receive capacity revenue going forward.This communication in comb
ination with current adverse market conditions were determined to be an impairment indicator. The Company performed a long-livedasset impairment t
est considering different scenarios and determined that, based on undiscounted cash flows, the carrying amount of San Lorenzo was notrecoverable. The fai
r value of San Lorenzo was determined using the market approach based on a broker quote and it was determined that its carrying amount of$23 million 
exceeded the estima ted fair value of $7 million . As a result, the Company recogniz ed asset impairment expense of $16 million . Itabo is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.

— Deferred income taxes reflect  the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets andliabilities for f
inancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and (b) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. These items are statedat the enacted tax rates that are
 expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.As of December 31, 
2015 , the Company had federal net op erating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $3.5 billion expiring in years 2021 to 2034. Approximately 
$87 million of the net operating loss c arryforward related to stock option deductions will be recognized in additional paid-in capital whenrealized. The Company also had 
federal general business tax credit carryforwards of approximately $18 million expiring primarily f rom 2021 to 2035, and federalalternative minimum tax credits of
 approximately $5 million that carry forward without expiration. The Company had state net operating loss carryforwards as ofDecember 31, 
2015 of approximately $8.4 billion expiring in years 2016 to 2035. As of Decemb er 31, 2015 , the Company had foreign net oper ating losscarryforwards of approxim
ately $3.5 billion that expire at various times beginning in 2016 and some of which carry forward without expiration, and tax creditsavailable in foreign jurisdicti

Valuation allowances decr
eased $103 million during 2015 to $894 million at December 31, 2015 . This net decrease was prim arily the result of foreignexchange losses and valuation 
allowance releases at certain of our Brazil and Vietnam subsidiaries.Valuation allowances decr
eased $93 million during 2014 to $997 million at December 31, 2014 . This net decrease was prim arily the result of valuationallowance activity a

is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets as shown below will be realized when future taxable income is generatedthrough the reversal of ex
isting taxable temporary differences and income that is expected to be generated by businesses that have long-term contracts or a historyof generating taxable 
income. The Company continues to monitor the utilization of its deferred tax asset for its U.S. consolidated net operating loss carryforward.Although management 
believes it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized through generation of sufficient taxable income prior toexpiration of the loss ca

earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, accordingly, noU.S. deferred taxes have been r
ecorded with respect to such earnings in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. Should the earnings beremitted as dividends, th
e Company may be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of anyadditional taxes which may b
e payable on the undistributed earnings.Income from operations in
 certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capitalinvestment. The Company's income 
tax benefits related to the tax status of these operations are estimated to be $21 million , $38 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 
2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The per sha re effect of these benefits after noncontrolling interests was $0.02 , $0.04 and $0.09  for the years ended December 31, 
2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Company's business in Vietnam began co
mmercial operations in 2015. As part of its power purchase contract with the Vietnam government, thebusiness will be subject to the 
following reduced income tax rates: 0% for four years, followed by 5% for nine years, followed by 10% for the remaining life of the contract term. See Item 1 
. — Business — Our Organization and Segments for additional inform ation regarding the power purchase contract.The benefit related 
to our operations in Vietnam is estimated to be $8 million for the year ended Decemb er 31, 2015. The per share effect of these benefitsafter noncontrolling in

As of December 31, 
2015 and 2014 , the total amount of gross a ccrued income tax related interest included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $8 million 
and $14 million , respectively. The tota l amount of gross accrued income tax related penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as ofDecember 31, 
2015 and 2014 was $0 million and $1 million , respectively. The total expense (benef
it) for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 amounted to $0 million , $3 million 
and $(4) million , respectively. For the yea rs ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the total expense (be nefit) for penalties related tounrecognized tax benefi
ts amounted to $0 million , $0 million and $(3) million , respectively. We are potentially sub
ject to income tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally until the applicable statute of limitations expires. Taxaudits by their nature a
re often complex and can require several years to complete. The following is a summary of tax years potentially subject to examination inthe significant tax and bus
iness jurisdictions in which we operate:Jurisdiction

 2011-2015 As of December 31, 
2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the total amount of unre cognized tax benefits was $373 million , $395 million and $392 million , respectively. The total amount of unrecogn
ized tax benefits that would benefit the effective tax rate as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is $343 million , $366 million and $360 million 
, respectively, of which $24 million , $24 million and $26 million , respectively, would be in the form of tax attributes that would warrant a fullvaluation allowance.
The total amount of unrecogn
ized tax benefits anticipated to result in a net decrease to unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of December 31, 2015 is estimated to be between 
$15 million and $25 million , primarily relating to statute  of limitation lapses and tax exam settlements.Next is a reconciliat

idiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularlyassesses the potential out
come of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefitrecorded. While it is often
 difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe we haveappropriately accru
ed for our uncertain tax benefits. However, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact ourpreviously recorded unrecogn
ized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty.It is possible that the ul
timate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could bematerial, but cannot be estimate
d as of December 31, 2015 . Our effective tax ra te and net income in any given future period could therefore be materiallyimpacted.

$25 million , pursuant to the terms and cond itions of a definitive agreement dated January 24, 2015. The purchase consideration was composed of$20 million 
cash and the fair value o f earn-out payments of $5 million . At December 31, 2015, the assets acqu ired (including $4 million cash) and liabilities assumed at the acquisit
ion date were recorded at fair value based on the final purchase price allocation, which resulted in the recognition of $16 million of goodwill. Subsequent changes to the fa
ir value of earn-out payments will be reflected in earnings.26 
. EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic and diluted earnings pe
r share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock outstanding duringthe period. Potential com
mon stock, for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutive restricted stock units, stock options andconvertible securit
ies. The effect of such potential common stock is computed using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable.The following table is a re

, all 15 million convertible debentures we re omitted from the earnings per share calculation. The stock awards and convertible debentures were excluded fromthe calculation because they

. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESAES is a diversified power genera
tion and utility company organized into six market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principalmarkets in Note  
17 — Segment and Geographic Information . Within our six SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: Generation and Utilities. TheGeneration line of business uses 
a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar and biomass. Our Utilitiesbusiness is comprised of businesses 
that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in therenewables area. These e
fforts include projects primarily in wind and solar.Operating and Economic Risks 
— The Company operates in severa l developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are usually more volatile thandeveloped economies. Deter
iorating market conditions often expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors,adverse fluctuations in 
the commodities and foreign currency spot markets. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, whichcould impact our abili
ty to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has a below-investment grade rating fromStandard & Poor's of BB-. This could affec
t the Company's ability to finance new and/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As ofDecember 31, 2015 
, the Company had $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.During 
2015 , 76% of our revenue was generated ou tside the U.S. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developingcountries. We continue to 
invest in several developing countries to expand our existing platform and operations. International operations, particularly the operation,financing and development o
f projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:•
economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;•
inability to economically hedge energy prices;•
volatility in commodity prices;•
adverse changes in currency exchange rates;•
government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;•
unexpected changes in foreign laws, regulatory framework, or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;•
high inflation and monetary fluctuations;•
restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;•
threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;•
unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their commitments;•
unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries ofthe Company and economically un
favorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;•
inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;•
adverse changes in government tax policy;174

THE AES CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINA
NCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013
•
difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights, enforcing judgments, or obtaining a just result in local jurisdictions; and•
potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.Any of these factors, individua
lly or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financialcondition. In addition, our Lat
in American operations experience volatility in revenue and earnings which have caused and are expected to cause significantvolatility in our resul
ts of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability, indexation of certainPPAs to fuel prices, and currency f
luctuations being experienced in many of these countries; particularly in Argentina, where $124 million in net foreign currency transaction gains were r
ecognized in 2015 primarily from foreign currency  derivatives related to government receivables. This volatility reduces the predictabilityand enhances the uncerta
inty associated with cash flows from these businesses.Our inability to predict, 
influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain reasonable increases intariffs or tarif
f adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections oranalysts' expectations. Furth
ermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where weoperate, particula
rly our Utility businesses where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, butnot limited to:
•
changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs;•
changes in the definition or determination of controllable or noncontrollable costs;•
adverse changes in tax law;•
changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;•
changes in the timing of tariff increases;•
other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or•
changes in environmental regulations, including regulations relating to GHG emissions in any of our businesses.Any of the above events may resul
t in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our results of operations.Foreign Currency Risks 
— AES operates businesses in many fore ign countries and such operations could be impacted by significant fluctuations in foreigncurrency exchange rat
es. Fluctuations in currency exchange rate between U.S. Dollar and the following currencies could create significant fluctuations to earningsand cash flows: the Argentine peso, 
the Brazilian real, the Dominican Republic peso, the Euro, the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso, the Philippine peso and theKazakhstan tenge.
Argentina 
— In December 2015, the Argentine gov ernment lifted foreign currency controls, which resulted in a depreciation of the Argentine peso againstthe US dollar by approximately 30
%. Over the course of 2015, the Argentinean Peso devalued by approximately 50% against the US dollar. Our businesses inArgentina are dependent on th
e solvency of the Argentine government with which we have long-term receivables. See Note 7 — Financing Receivables for further information on the long-t
erm receivables. Further weakening of the Argentine Peso and local economic activity could cause significant volatility in our results ofoperations, cash flows, and the va
lue of our assets.Concentrations 
— Due to the geographical dive rsity of its operations, the Company does not have any significant concentration of customers or sources offuel supply. Several of the Company's g
eneration businesses rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of,the relevant businesses' outpu
t over the term of the PPAs. However, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . The cash flows and results of oper
ations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of their customers and the continued ability of their customers andsuppliers to meet thei
r obligations under PPAs and fuel supply agreements. If a substantial portion of the Company's long-term PPAs and/or fuel supply weremodified or termina
ted, the Company would be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace such contracts at equally favorable terms.Bulgaria 
— Maritza, the Company's gener ation facility in Bulgaria, has experienced ongoing delays in the collection of outstanding receivables as a result ofliquidity issues faced by our o
fftaker, NEK. As of December 31, 2015 , Maritza's outstanding ac counts receivable were $351 million , of which $307 million were overdue. 
No allowance has been recognized on the receivables as the Company continues to assert that collection is probable.The Bulgarian government el
ected in 2014 has undertaken an initiative to reform its energy sector, which is necessary to restore NEK's liquidity. NEK'scredit rating was downgraded and 
its transmission license was revoked by the Bulgarian Regulator, which are events of default under the PPA and triggeredadditional events of def
ault by Maritza under the project175

Although Maritza continued to 
collect overdue receivables throughout 2015, collections continue to be at risk, which could result in an allowance to berecorded against the remainin

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURESConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosur
e controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that theCompany files or submits under th
e Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported withinthe time periods speci
fied in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allowtimely decisions rega
rding required disclosures.The Company carried out the ev
aluation required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), under the supervision and with the participation of our management,including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiv
eness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)).Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded th
at as of December 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is r
esponsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)under the Exchange Act. The Company's int
ernal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability offinancial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:•
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and thatreceipts and expenditur
es of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and•
provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financialstatements are prevented or 
detected timely.Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expec
t that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, nomatter how well designed and ope
rated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the designof a control system must r
eflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In addition, anyevaluation of the eff
ectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in businessconditions, or that the degr
ee of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.Management assessed the e
ffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 . In making this assessment, m anagementused the criteria es
tablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission("COSO") in 2013. Based on this assessment, managem
ent believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as ofDecember 31, 2015 
. The effectiveness of th
e Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered pub
lic accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Repor
ting:There were no changes that oc
curred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are  reasonably likely to materially affect,our internal control ove
r financial reporting.178

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholde
rs of The AES Corporation:We have audited The AES Corporation's in
ternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). The AESCorporation's manageme
nt is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to expressan opinion on the Company's internal 
control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require thatwe plan and perform t
he audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all materialrespects. Our audit included ob
taining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing andevaluating the design and ope
rating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessaryin the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company's internal control ov
er financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting andthe preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate.In our opinion, The AES Corporation mainta
ined, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, basedon the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheetsof The AES Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, 
and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, andcash flows for each of the th
ree years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of The AES Corporation and our report dated February 23, 2016 expressed anunqualified opinion thereon.

following the date vested PSUs become earned and payable under paragraph 5(a), paragraph 6 or paragraph 7 of this
Agreement, as applicable (the “Payment Date”), but in no event later than March 15th of the calendar year following the
calendar year containing the Payment Date.

4.A PSU carries no voting rights and the holder of a PSU will not have an equity interest in the Company or any shareholder rights, unless the vesting and performance conditions of the PSU are met and the PSU is paid out.
5.
This Award of PSUs will vest, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, in three equal installments on December 31st in each year during the Performance Period (each a “Vesting Date”), provided, however, that if:
 
(a)
the Employee Separates from Service prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of the Employee’s death or a Separation from Service on account of Disability, all PSUs that have not previously vested shall vest and the Employee’s
PSUs referenced in the chart above shall be paid to the Employee at the rate of one Share for each PSU;
(b)
if (i) the Employee Separates from Service prior to the Payment Date by reason of a Separation from Service by the Company for Cause (as defined in the Plan and as may otherwise be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion)
or (ii) the Employee Separates from Service prior to the final Vesting Date by reason of a voluntary Separation from
Service by the Employee (including any retirement other than a Qualified Retirement (as defined below)), this Award of
PSUs (including any time-vested portion) shall immediately upon such termination be cancelled and forfeited without
payment or further obligation by the Company; and
(c)
if the Employee Separates from Service for any other reason, including, but not limited to, on account of a Qualified Retirement, by reason of a death or Disability subsequent to the end of the Performance Period, or by reason of a
Separation from Service by the Company other than for Cause (other than for Cause, voluntarily by the Employee not as
part of a Qualified Retirement or due to death or Disability as provided in paragraphs 5(a) and 5(b)), the Employee will
be eligible to receive the value of his or her vested PSUs, as of the date of the Separation from Service, on the Payment
Date in accordance with and subject to the terms set forth in paragraph 6 below.
Any PSUs that have not vested prior to the date that an Employee Separates from Service for any reason (other than by
reason of death or Disability as provided in paragraph 5(a)), (i) will not subsequently vest; and (ii) will be immediately
cancelled and forfeited without payment or further obligation by the Company or any Affiliate. In addition, the Employee’s
right to receive Shares in respect of vested PSUs that have not been forfeited will be paid on the Payment Date if, and only if,
all relevant performance conditions are met, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. For
purposes of this Agreement, “Qualified Retirement” means the Employee’s retirement at a time when such Employee is at
least 60 years of age and has had at least seven years of service as an employee of the Company and/or one or more of its
Affiliates.
 
6.
The Company will issue and deliver Shares in satisfaction of vested PSUs subject to and conditioned upon the attainment of the performance conditions set forth below, as approved by the Committee at the time of grant; provided, however,
notwithstanding the performance level achieved, the Committee may reduce the number of PSUs earned or terminate this
2

Award of PSUs altogether, but in no event may the Committee increase the value of a PSU underlying this Award beyond theperformance levels achieved. For purposes of this Agreement, the “Performance Period” is the three calendar year period
beginning on January 1st in the year of grant and ending on and through December 31st in the second year following the year
of the grant date.
The value of each vested PSU will depend upon the Company’s actual Proportional Free Cash Flow (“PFCF”) as defined
below, over the Performance Period as compared to the performance target approved by the Committee and as follows:
ACTUAL PFCF 
OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD
SHARES EARNEDBelow 75% of Performance Target =
None (0%) Equal to 87.5% of Performance Target =
50% (0.5 x number of vested PSUs)
Equal to 100% of Performance Target =
100% (1.0 x number of vested PSUs)
Equal to or greater than 125% of Performance Targe
t =200% (2.0 x number of vested PSUs)
7.
For PFCF levels achieved greater than 75% and less than 87.5% of performance target, greater than 87.5% and less than 100% of performance target, and greater than 100% and less than 125% of performance target, the Performance Unit
value will be determined based on straight-line interpolation. The maximum value of a PSU is $2.00. 
In the event of a (i) Change in Control and (ii) a Qualifying Event (as defined below) prior to the end of the Performance Period, if the PSUs
described herein have not already been previously forfeited or cancelled, such PSUs will become fully vested (for the total
amount of PSUs set forth in paragraph 1) and the Payment Date will occur contemporaneous with the Qualifying Event;
provided, however, that in connection with a Change in Control, payment of any obligation payable pursuant to the preceding
sentence may be made in cash of equivalent value and/or securities or other property in the Committee’s discretion.
(a)
Change in Control means the occurrence of one or more of the following events: (i) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company to
any Person or group (as that term is used in Section 13(d) (3) of the Exchange Act) of Persons, (ii) a Person or group (as
so defined in the Plan) of Persons (other than Management of the Company on the date of the most recent adoption of the
Plan by the Company's stockholders or their Affiliates) shall have become the beneficial owner (as defined below) of
more than 35% of the outstanding voting stock of the Company, (iii) during any one-year period, individuals who at the
beginning of such period constitute the Board (together with any new Director whose election or nomination was
approved by a majority of the Directors then in office who were either Directors at the beginning of such period or who
were previously so approved, but excluding under all circumstances
3

any such new Director whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest orother actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of any individual, corporation, partnership or
other entity or group, including through the use of proxy access procedures as may be provided in the Company’s bylaws)
cease to constitute a majority of the Board, or (iv) the consummation of a merger, consolidation, business combination or
similar transaction involving the Company unless securities representing 65% or more of the then outstanding voting
stock of the corporation resulting from such transaction are held subsequent to such transaction by the Person or Persons
who were the beneficial owners of the outstanding voting stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction in
substantially the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any provision to the contrary, if an Award is subject to Section 409A (and not excepted therefrom) and a
Change in Control is a distribution event for purposes of an Award, the foregoing definition of Change in Control shall be
interpreted, administered and construed in a manner necessary to ensure that the occurrence of any such event shall result
in a Change in Control only if such event qualifies as a change in the ownership or effective control of a corporation, or a
change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation, as applicable, within the meaning of Treas.
Reg. § 1.409A-3(i)(5). For purposes of this Agreement, “beneficial owner(s)” shall have the meaning set forth in Rule
13d-3 of the Exchange Act.
(b)

Awards that are substantially similar in both nature and terms (including having an equivalent realizable pre-tax value to
outstanding awards assuming vesting and delivery at the consummation of the Change in Control); (ii) within two years of
the consummation of a Change in Control event, an involuntary termination without Cause of the Employee; or (iii)
within two years of the consummation of a Change in Control event, a Good Reason Termination (as defined below) by
the Employee.

Good Reason Termination means, without an Employee’s written consent, the Separation From Service (for reasons other than death, Disability or Cause) by an Employee due to any of the following events occurring within two years of the
consummation of a Change in Control: (i) the relocation of an Employee’s principal place of employment to a location
that is more than 50 miles from the principal place of employment in effect immediately prior to such Change in Control;
(ii) a material diminution in the duties or responsibilities of an Employee from those in place immediately prior to such
Change in Control; and (iii) a material reduction in the base salary or annual incentive opportunity of an Employee from
what was in place immediately prior to such Change in Control.
In order for Employee to terminate for Good Reason, (i) Employee must notify the successor entity in writing, within
ninety (90) days of the event constituting Good Reason, of the Employee’s intent to terminate employment for Good
Reason, that
4

specifically identifies in reasonable detail the manner of the Good Reason event, (ii) the event must remain uncorrectedfor thirty (30) days following the date that Employee notifies the successor entity in writing of Employee’s intent to
terminate employment for Good Reason (the “Notice Period”), and (iii) the termination date must occur within sixty (60)
days after expiration of the Notice Period.
8.
It is intended that under current U.S. federal income tax laws, the Employee will not be subject to income tax unless and until Shares are delivered to the Employee on the Payment Date, at which time the Fair Market Value of the Shares will be
reportable as ordinary income, and subject to income tax withholding as well as social security and Medicare (FICA) taxes.
The Employee must pay all applicable Federal and state income and employment withholding taxes when due in such manner
as approved by the Committee or the Plan Administrator.  The Employee should consult his or her personal advisor to
determine the effect of this Award of PSUs on his or her own tax situation.  
9.

Administrator, or, if to the Employee, will be delivered to the Employee, which may include electronic delivery, or mailed to
his or her address as the same appears on the records of the Company. 
10.
All decisions and interpretations made by the Board of Directors or the Committee with regard to any question arising hereunder or under the Plan will be binding and conclusive on all persons. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, in
the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan will govern. 
11.
By accepting this Award of PSUs, the Employee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and the prospectus relating to this Award of PSUs, and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan, as in effect
and/or amended from time to time.

Arlington, Virginia 22203. The Employee further acknowledges that the Employee will be provided with a paper copy of any
documents delivered electronically if electronic delivery fails.
12.
This Award is intended to be excepted from coverage under Section 409A of the Code and shall be administered, interpreted and construed accordingly. The Employee shall have no right to designate the date of any payment under this Agreement.
Each payment under this
5

Agreement is intended to be excepted under the short-term deferral exception as specified in Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(4).The Company may, in its sole discretion and without the Employee’s consent, modify or amend the terms and conditions of

Notwithstanding, the Employee recognizes and acknowledges that Section 409A of the Code may impose upon the Employee
certain taxes or interest charges for which the Employee is and shall remain solely responsible. 
13.
Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, any PSUs subject to recovery under any law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement, or Company policy, shall be subject to such deductions, recoupment and clawback as may
be required to be made pursuant to such law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement or Company policy,
as may be in effect from time to time, and which may operate to create additional rights for the Company with respect to this

this Award or amounts paid under the Plan pursuant to such law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement

2.
The Employee is hereby granted an Award of the total number of Performance Units (at target) set forth above. The Performance Units will be reflected in a book account by the Company during the Performance Period (as defined below).

4.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Award of Performance Units will vest, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, in three equal installments on December 31st in each year during the Performance Period
(each a “Vesting Date”); provided, however, that if:

(B)
(i) the Employee Separates from Service prior to the Payment Date by reason of a Separation from Service by the Company for Cause (as defined in the Plan and as may otherwise be determined by the Committee in its sole

defined below, over the Performance Period as compared to the performance target approved by the Committee and as
follows:
ACTUAL PFCF 
OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD
PERFORMANCE UNIT VALUE
Below 75% of Performance Target =
USD$0.00 Equal to 87.5% of Performance Target =
USD$0.50 Equal to 100% of Performance Target =
USD$1.00 Equal to or greater than 125% of Performance Target =
USD$2.00 For PFCF levels achieved greater than 75% and less than 87.5% of performance target, greater than 87.5% and less than
100% of performance target, and greater than 100% and less than 125% of performance target, the Performance Unit

Notwithstanding the performance level achieved, the Committee may reduce or terminate the Performance Units altogether,
but in no event may the Committee increase the value of a Performance Unit underlying this Award of Performance Units
beyond the performance levels achieved.

THE AES CORPORATION 2003 LONG TERM COMPENSATION PLAN
The AES Corporation, a Delaware Corporation (the “Company”), grants to the Employee named below, pursuant to The AES
Corporation 2003 Long Term Compensation Plan, as amended (the “Plan”), and this Performance Cash Unit Award Agreement (this
“Agreement”), this Award of Performance Cash Units (“PCUs”), the value of which is related to and contingent upon the
achievement of predetermined performance target (as set forth herein). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall each
have the meaning assigned to them in the Plan.
1.
This Award of PCUs is subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference:
Name of Employee:
  
 Fidelity System ID:
  
 Grant Date:
  
 Target Number of PCUs:
  
 Target Value:
 Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, this Award of PCUs is subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Plan regardless of whether the Employee is a Covered Person, as defined in the Plan.
2.
The Employee is hereby granted an Award of the Target number of PCUs set forth above. The PCUs will be reflected in a book account by the Company during the Performance Period (as defined below). Contingent upon achieving required
performance levels, the value of vested PCUs, will be paid in cash in the calendar year following the completion of the
Performance Period (the “Payment Date”), as soon as administratively practicable following the end of the Performance
Period.

3.The “Performance Period” is the three calendar year period beginning on January 1st in the year of grant and ending on and through December 31st in the second year following the year of the grant date.
4.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Award of PCUs will vest, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, in three equal installments on December 31st in each year during the Performance Period (each a “Vesting
Date”); provided, however, that if:
(A)
the Employee Separates from Service prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of the Employee’s death or a Separation from Service on account of Disability, all PCUs referenced in the chart above shall vest on such
termination date and a cash amount equal to $1 for each PCU shall be paid to the Employee on the date of Separation
from Service (or as soon as practicable thereafter); provided, however, any payment due to the Employee by reason of
a Separation from Service on account of Disability shall be delayed to the extent required by Section 14(k)(i) of the
Plan;
(B)
(i) the Employee Separates from Service prior to the Payment Date by reason of a Separation from Service by the Company for Cause (as defined in the Plan and as may otherwise be determined by the Committee in its sole
discretion for all purposes of this Agreement) or (ii) the Employee Separates from Service prior to the final Vesting
Date by reason of a voluntary Separation from Service by the Employee (including any retirement other than a
Qualified Retirement (as defined below)), this Award of PCUs (including any vested portion) will be forfeited in full
and cancelled by the Company, and shall cease to be outstanding, upon such termination date; and
(C)
the Employee Separates from Service for any other reason, including on account of a Qualified Retirement, by reason of death or Disability subsequent to the end of the Performance Period, or by reason of a Separation from Service by
the Company (other than for Cause, voluntarily by the Employee not as part of a Qualified Retirement or due to death
or Disability as provided in paragraphs 4(A) and 4(B)), the Employee will be eligible to receive the value of his or her
vested PCUs, as of the date of Separation from Service, on the Payment Date in accordance with and subject to the
terms set forth in paragraph 5 below. For purposes of this Agreement, “Qualified Retirement” means the Employee’s
retirement at a time when such Employee is at least 60 years of age and has at least seven years of service as an
employee of the Company and/or one or more of its Affiliates.
2

Any PCUs that have not vested on or before the date that an Employee Separates from Service for any reason (other than byreason of death or Disability as provided in paragraph 4(A)), (i) will not subsequently vest; and (ii) will be immediately
cancelled and forfeited without payment or further obligation by the Company or any Affiliate. In addition, the Employee’s
right to receive the applicable PCU value in respect of vested PCUs that have not been forfeited will be paid on the Payment
Date, if, and only if, all relevant performance conditions are met, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Plan.
5.
Each PCU represents a right to receive the applicable PCU value in the chart below, in cash on the Payment Date, if and only if, such PCU (i) has not been forfeited prior to its Vesting Date and (ii) has vested in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.
The value of each PCU will depend upon the performance of the Total Shareholder Return of AES common stock (“AES
TSR”) as compared to the Total Shareholder Return of companies in the peer groups listed below over the Performance
Period:
PEER GROUP INDEX
PROPORTIONAL WEIGHTING S&P Utilities Index
50% S&P 500 Index
25% MSCI Emerging Markets Index

Equal to the 50 th  Percentile100%

percentile and less than 70th percentile, and greater than the 70th percentile and less than the 90th percentile, the Index
Score will be determined based on straight-line interpolation. The maximum Index Score is 200%.
3

The AES TSR will be evaluated against each of the separate peer group indices separately to determine the three indexscores. The overall performance value for a PCU will be equal to:
The number of vested PCUs x $1.00 x [(S&P 500 Utilities Index Score x 50%) + (S&P 500 Index Score x 25%) + (MSCI
Emerging Markets Index Score x 25%)] = Total Earned PCU Value
Notwithstanding the performance level achieved, the Committee may reduce or terminate the PCUs altogether, but in no
event may the Committee increase the value of a PCU underlying this Award beyond the performance levels achieved.
6.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a (i) Change in Control (as defined below) and (ii) a Qualifying Event (as defined below) prior to the end of the Performance Period, if the PCUs described herein have not already been previously
forfeited or cancelled, such PCUs shall become fully vested (for the Target number of PCUs set forth in paragraph 1) and
payable in a cash amount equal to $1.00 for each PCU, and the Payment Date will occur contemporaneous with the
Qualifying Event; provided, however, that in connection with a Change in Control, payment of any obligation payable
