Preferred Stock
.  The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized, subject to limitations
 
prescribed by law, to provide by resolution or resolutions for the issuance of the shares of Preferred
 
Stock in one or more series and, by filing a certificate of designation pursuant to the DGCL setting
 
forth a copy of such resolution or resolutions, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be
 
included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers (including voting powers, if any),
 
preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations, and
 
restrictions thereof.
  
2
The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each series of Preferred Stock shall include, but not be
 
limited to, determination of the following:
(i)
the number of shares constituting such series and the distinctive designation of that
series;
(ii)
the dividend rate, if any, on the shares of such series, whether dividends shall be
cumulative, and, if so, from which date or dates, and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of
dividends on shares of that series;
(iii)
whether such series shall have voting rights, in addition to the voting rights provided by
law, and, if so, the terms of such voting rights;
(iv)
whether such series shall have conversion privileges and, if so, the terms and conditions
of conversion, including provision for adjustment of the conversion rate upon such events as the Board
of Directors shall determine;
(v)
whether or not the shares of such series shall be redeemable, and, if so, the terms and
conditions of such redemption, including the date or dates upon or after which they shall be redeemable
and the amount per share payable in case of redemption, which amount may vary under different
conditions and at different redemption dates;
(vi)
whether such series shall have a sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of shares
of the series, and, if so, the terms and amount of such sinking fund;
(vii)
the rights of the shares of such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation, and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of shares of that
series; and
(viii)
any other powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions of such
series.

voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of Common Stock are as follows:

vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.  There shall be no cumulative voting.
(ii)
Dividends and Distributions
.  Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any
outstanding series of Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive such dividends and other distributions in cash, property or shares of stock of the Corporation as
may be declared thereon by the Board of Directors from time to time out of assets or funds of the
Corporation legally available therefor.
3
(iii)
Liquidation Rights
.  In the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the
affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment or provision for payment of
the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any
outstanding series of Preferred Stock, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation, if any, shall
be divided among and paid ratably to the holders of Common Stock in proportion to the number of
shares held by them.
(iv)
Preemptive Rights
.  The holders of Common Stock shall have no preemptive right to
subscribe for any shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation whether now or
hereafter authorized.
ARTICLE 5
The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.
ARTICLE 6
At the time this Certificate of Incorporation becomes effective, the Board of Directors of the
Corporation shall consist of three (3) directors, but may be increased or decreased from time to time by
resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office; provided that the number
of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be not less than three (3).  The Board of
Directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III, until the Corporation’s
annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2025.  Class I directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of
stockholders to be held in 2023 for a one-year term, and they and any successors shall stand for re-election at
the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2024; Class II directors shall serve out their current three-
year terms, and they and any successors shall stand for re-election to a one-year term at the annual meeting
of stockholders in 2024; Class III directors shall serve out their current three-year terms, and they and any
successors shall stand for re-election to a one-year term at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2025.  At
each annual meeting of the stockholders commencing with the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in
2025, each director shall be elected for a one-year term.  So long as the Board of Directors is classified, each
class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the
entire Board of Directors, and if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be
apportioned among the classes, for such period as they may continue to exist, so as to maintain the number of
directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a
vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the
remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any
incumbent director.  Unless and except to the extent that the By-Laws of the Corporation shall so require, the
election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot.
ARTICLE 7
In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors of the
Corporation is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation.
4
ARTICLE 8
Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware, as the By-Laws of the
Corporation may provide.  The books of the Corporation may be kept outside the State of Delaware at such
place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the By-Laws of the
Corporation.
ARTICLE 9
No stockholder action may be taken except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation and stockholders may not take any action by written consent in lieu of a meeting.
ARTICLE 10
Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation, for any purpose or purposes, may only be
called at any time by a majority of the entire Board of Directors or by either the Chairman or the President of
the Corporation.
ARTICLE 11
The Corporation shall be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto)
(“
Section 203
”), and the provisions contained in Section 203 shall apply to fullest extent permitted
thereunder.
ARTICLE 12
No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or
limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended.  Any
amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection
of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any director of the
Corporation with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to, such amendment,
modification or repeal.
ARTICLE 13
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended,
the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses to any person who was or is made
or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she
is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation (a “
Covered Person
”),
against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by such
Covered Person.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in the By-Laws (as
the same may provide from time to time), the Corporation shall be required to indemnify
5
a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or a part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person
only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized by the
By-Laws, in any written agreement with the Corporation, or in the specific case by the Board of Directors;
provided, however
, that if a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of an action, suit or
proceeding) or advancement of expenses is not paid in full within thirty (30) days after a written demand
therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to
recover the unpaid amount of such claim, and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the
expense of prosecuting such claim.  Nothing contained in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall affect any rights
to indemnification or advancement of expenses to which directors, officers, employees or agents of the
Corporation otherwise may be entitled under the By-Laws, any written agreement with the Corporation or
otherwise.  The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant
rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to
the fullest extent of the provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.  Any amendment, modification or
repeal of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a Covered Person
existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any Covered Person with respect to any acts or omissions of
such Covered Person occurring prior to, such amendment, modification or repeal.
ARTICLE 14
The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change, waive or repeal any provision of this
Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware
and this Certificate of Incorporation, and all rights, preferences and privileges conferred on stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents and other persons in this Certificate of Incorporation, if any, are granted
subject to this reservation.  Unless otherwise provided in the DGCL, any provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation may be amended by the vote of the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the
holders of all the then outstanding shares of stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(and where a separate vote by class is required by the DGCL, the vote of the holders of a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all the then outstanding shares of such class of stock then entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors).

Exhibit 3.2
AMENDMENTS TO THE BY-LAWS OF
ULTA BEAUTY, INC.
Effected by the Board of Directors as of June 1, 2023
(Additions in bold and underscore; deletions in strikethrough)
Article II, Section 5:  
Stockholders List
.  The officer having charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation
 
shall make, at least 10 days before every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders
 
entitled to vote at such meeting arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and
 
the number of shares registered in the name of the stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the examination of
 
any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, 
during ordinary business hours,
 for a period of at
least 10 days before the date of the meeting, 
(i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided
that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or
(ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation
 either at a
 
place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the
 
meeting or, if not specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.  The list shall also be produced and
 
kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any
 
stockholder who is present
.
Article II, Section 8:  
Vote Required
.  Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation,
 
these By-Laws or the rules or regulations of any stock exchanges applicable to the Corporation or its
 
securities, any question brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by the vote of the
 
holders of a majority of the stock which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat.  Where
 
a separate vote by class is required, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of such class present in
 
person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class.  
Each director of the
 
Corporation shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the shares of stock present in person or
 
by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election of such directors; provided, however, in any
 
contested election of directors (as defined below), the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the
 
votes of the shares of stock present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
 
election of directors.  For purposes of this Section 8 of Article II, (i) a “contested election of directors”
 
shall mean an election in which the number of nominees for director is greater than the number of
 
directors to be elected; and (ii) a “majority of the votes cast” means that the number of votes cast “for”
 
the election of a director must exceed the number of votes cast “against” the election of that director
 
(with “abstentions” and “broker non-votes” not counted as a vote cast either “for” or “against” that
 
director’s election).
Article II, Section 11:  
Business Brought Before a Meeting

2
purpose or purposes, of such meeting, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not
less then 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting.  All such notices shall be delivered, either
personally, by mail, or, except as otherwise provided by law, by a form of electronic transmission (consented
to by the stockholder to whom the notice is being given), by or at the direction of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary.  Any stockholder consent to electronic transmission shall
be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed
to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his,
her or its address as the same appears on the records of the Corporation.  Notice given by a form of electronic
transmission shall be deemed given (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at

notice, (iii) if by posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such

otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation.  A quorum, once established, shall not be
broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum and the votes present may continue to
transact business until adjournment.  If a quorum is not present, the holders of a majority of the shares present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, and entitled to vote at the meeting, may adjourn the
meeting to another time and/or place.  When a specified item of business requires a vote by class or series (if
the Corporation shall then have outstanding shares of more than one class or series) voting as a class, the
holders of a majority of the shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum (as to such class or series)
for the transaction of such item of business.

Laws or the rules or regulations of any stock exchanges applicable to the Corporation or its securities, any
question brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority
of the stock which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat.  Where a separate vote by
class is required, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of such class present in person or represented
by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class.  Each director of the Corporation shall be elected by a
majority of the votes cast by the shares of stock present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to
vote in the election of such directors; 
provided
, 
however
, in any contested election of directors (as defined
below), the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares of stock present in person or by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.  For purposes of this Section 8 of
Article II, (i) a “
contested election of directors
” shall mean an election in which the number of nominees for
director is greater than the number of directors to be elected; and (ii) a “
majority of the votes cast
” means that
the number of votes cast “for” the election of a director must exceed the number of votes cast “against” the
election of that director (with “abstentions” and “broker non-votes” not counted as a vote cast either “for” or
“against” that director’s election).

Nominees nominated by all Eligible Stockholders that will be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials
with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed the greater of (i) two (2) or (ii) twenty
percent (20%) of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Notice of Proxy Access
Nomination may be delivered pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 15 of Article III (the “
Final
Proxy Access Nomination Date
”) or, if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below
twenty percent (20%).  In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board after the
Final Proxy Access Nomination Date but before the date of the annual meeting and the Board resolves to
reduce the size of the Board in connection therewith, the maximum number of Stockholder Nominees
included in the Corporation’s proxy materials shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as
so reduced. 
 The maximum number of Stockholder Nominees provided for in this Section 15 of Article III for
 
any annual meeting shall be reduced by (i) the number of directors (if any) in office as of the Final Proxy
 
Access Nomination Date who were included in the Corporation’s proxy materials as a Stockholder Nominee
 
for any of the three (3) preceding annual meetings of stockholders (including any individual counted as a
 
Stockholder Nominee pursuant to the immediately succeeding sentence) and whom the Board decides to
 
nominate for re-election to the Board at such annual meeting and (ii) the number of individuals (if any) who
 
will be included in the Corporation’s proxy statement as nominees recommended by the Board pursuant to an
 
agreement, arrangement or other understanding with a stockholder or group of stockholders (other than any
 
such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in a connection with an acquisition of capital
 
stock from the Corporation by such stockholder or group of stockholders).  For purposes of determining when
 
the maximum number of Stockholder Nominees provided for in this Section 15 of Article III has been
 
reached, each of the following persons shall be counted as one of the Stockholder Nominees:
  
9
(A)  any individual nominated by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the
Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 15 of Article III whose nomination is subsequently
withdrawn, and
(B) any individual nominated by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the
Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 15 of Article III whom the Board decides to nominate
for election to the Board.
 
Any Eligible Stockholder submitting more than one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation’s
proxy materials pursuant to this Section 15 of Article III shall rank such Stockholder Nominees based on the
order in which the Eligible Stockholder desires such Stockholder Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the
Corporation’s proxy materials.  In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible
Stockholders pursuant to this Section 15 of Article III exceeds the maximum number of Stockholder
Nominees provided for in this Section 15 of Article III, the highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets
the requirements of this Section 15 of Article III from each Eligible Stockholder will be selected for inclusion
in the Corporation’s proxy materials until the maximum number is reached, going in order of the amount
(largest to smallest) of shares of stock of the Corporation each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as owned in its
Notice of Proxy Access Nomination.  If the maximum number is not reached after the highest ranking
Stockholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 15 of Article III from each Eligible
Stockholder has been selected, then the next highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets the
requirements of this Section 15 of Article III from each Eligible Stockholder will be selected for inclusion in
the Corporation’s proxy materials, and this process will continue as many times as necessary, following the
same order each time, until the maximum number is reached.
 
(c)  
Required Shares and Minimum Holding Period
.  In order to make a nomination pursuant
to this Section 15 of Article III, an Eligible Stockholder must have continuously owned (as hereinafter
defined) for at least three (3) years as of the date the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination is delivered to the
Secretary of the Corporation in accordance with this Section 15 of Article III (the “
Minimum Holding
Period
”) a number of shares of stock of the Corporation that represents at least three percent (3%) of the
voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors (the
“
Required Shares
”), and must continue to own the Required Shares through the date of the annual meeting. 
For purposes of this Section 15 of Article III, an Eligible Stockholder shall be deemed to “
own
” only those
outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation as to which the stockholder possesses both:
 
(i)  the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares, and
 
(ii)  the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit from and risk of
loss on) such shares,
 
10
provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with the immediately preceding
clauses (i) and (ii) shall not include any shares:
 
(A)  sold by such stockholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has
not been settled or closed,
 
(B)  borrowed by such stockholder or any of its affiliates for any purposes or
purchased by such stockholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell, or
 
(C)  subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale,
other derivative or similar instrument or agreement entered into by such stockholder or any of its affiliates,
whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional
amount or value of shares of outstanding stock of the Corporation, if, in any such case, such instrument or
agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of:
 
(1)  reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future,
such stockholder’s or its affiliates’ full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or
 
(2)  hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree any gain or loss
realized or realizable from maintaining the full economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder or
affiliate.
 
A stockholder shall “
own
” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the
stockholder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and
possesses the full economic interest in the shares.  A person’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to
continue during any period in which (i) the stockholder has loaned such shares, provided that the person has
the power to recall such loaned shared on five (5) business days’ notice or (ii) the stockholder has delegated
any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement which is
revocable at any time by the stockholder.  The terms “
owned
,” “
owning
” and other variations of the word
“
own
” shall have correlative meanings.  Whether outstanding shares of the stock of the Corporation are
“
owned
” for these purposes shall be determined by the Board or any committee thereof.  For purposes of this
Section 15 of Article III, the term “
affiliate
” or “
affiliates
” shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the
General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act.
 
(d)  
Requirements for a Group
.
 
(i)  Whenever the Eligible Stockholder consists of a group of stockholders:
 
11
(A)  a group of funds under common management and control shall be treated
as one stockholder,
 
(B)  each provision in this Section 15 of Article III that requires the Eligible
Stockholder to provide any written statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments
or to meet any other conditions shall be deemed to require each stockholder (including each individual fund
that is a member of a group of funds treated as one stockholder) that is a member of such group to provide
such statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments and to meet such other
conditions (except that the members of such group may aggregate their shareholdings in order to meet the
three percent (3%) ownership requirement of the “Required Shares” definition),
 
(C)  a breach of any obligation, agreement or representation under this Section
15 of Article III by any member of such group shall be deemed a breach by the Eligible Stockholder, and
 
(D)  the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination must designate one member of
the group for purposes of receiving communications, notices and inquiries from the Corporation and
otherwise authorize such member to act on behalf of all members of the group with respect to all matters
relating to the nomination under this Section 15 of Article III (including withdrawal of the nomination).
 
(ii)  Whenever the Eligible Stockholder consists of a group of stockholders
aggregating their shareholdings in order to meet the three percent (3%) ownership requirement of the
“Required Shares” definition in clause (c) of this Section 15 of Article III:
 
(A)  such ownership shall be determined by aggregating the lowest number of
shares continuously owned by each such stockholder during the Minimum Holding Period, and
 
(B)  the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination must indicate, for each such
stockholder, such lowest number of shares continuously owned by such stockholder during the Minimum
Holding Period.
 
(iii)  Any group of funds whose shares are aggregated for purposes of constituting an
Eligible Stockholder must, within five (5) business days after the date of the Notice of Proxy Access
Nomination, provide documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation that demonstrates that the
funds are under common management and investment control. No person may be a member of more than one
group of stockholders constituting an Eligible Stockholder with respect to any annual meeting.  For the
avoidance of doubt, a stockholder may withdraw from a group of stockholders constituting an Eligible
Stockholder at any time prior to the annual meeting and if, as a result of such withdrawal, the Eligible
12
Stockholder no longer owns the Required Shares, the nomination shall be disregarded as provided in clause
 
(j)(ix) of this Section 15 of Article III.
 
(e)  
Deadline for Notice of Proxy Access Nomination
.  Nominations by stockholders pursuant
to this Section 15 of Article III, must be made pursuant to timely notice to the Secretary of the Corporation in

(or extend any time period) for the giving of a Notice of Proxy Access Nomination pursuant to this Section
 
15 of Article III.
