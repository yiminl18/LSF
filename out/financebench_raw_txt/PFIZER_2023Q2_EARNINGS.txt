EXECUTIVE  COMMENTARY
Dr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Pfizer has made significant progress toward 
our goal to launch 19 new products and indications in an 18-month span, having executed  eleven launches thus 
far. We continue to build momentum in 2023,  recently attaining key milestones for several products, including the 
U.S. launches of Prevnar 20 in pediatric patients  and Zavzpret; U.S. approvals  and launches for Abrysvo in older 
adults, Litfulo and the Talzenna plus Xtandi combination; U.S. approvals  for Ngenla  (expected to be available for 
prescribing this month)  and Paxlovid ; and U.S. regulatory filing acceptance for fidanacogene elaparvovec 
(Hemophilia B Gene Therapy). 
Supporting our  expectation  to deliver robust operational growth in 202 5 and beyond , we also reported data from 
several exciting pipeline candidates we believe have the potential to be significant future value-drivers , including 
Phase 3 data from marstacimab, Pfizer’s novel,  investigational anti- TFPI  antibody being studied for the treatment 
of hemophilia A or B; further data from elranatamab, Pfizer’s investigational BCMA CD3-targeted bispecific 
- 1 -
antibody currently being investigated in  multiple myeloma; and first-in-human data from our pipeline of potential 
next-generation breast cancer treatments, including our novel CDK4, CDK2, and KAT6 inhibitors.
Final ly, we continue to make progress toward our proposed acquisition of Seagen , a global biotechnology 
company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative oncology medicines. In addition to 
receiving approval of the transaction from Seagen shareholders and planning for the potential integration of the 
two companies, we continue  to work closely with regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 
the European Commission  (EC) , and are working diligently to fulfill request s for further information from the 
FTC.
We look forward to continuing our progress in the second half of 2023, driven by commercial execution , 
scientific innovation and our never-ending commitment to delivering breakthroughs for patients.”
David Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, stated: “ The second quarter of 2023 
delivered solid 5% operational revenue growth, excluding our COVID-19 products, and our year-to-date  results 
are in line with our expectations . Despite a few near-term individual product revenue challenges, we believe the 
company is well positioned for accelerated growth of our non-COVID products in the second half of 2023. The 
COVID environment continues to evolve rapidly and remains highly unpredictable. In spite of this uncertainty, 
the company is maintaining its focus on ensuring successful fall vaccinations during the respiratory infection 
season.
During the second quarter  we successfully closed a $31 billion debt offering, the net proceeds of which we intend 
to use as part of the financing for Pfizer’s proposed acquisition of Seagen. We continue to expect the transaction 
to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. As we de-lever our 
capital structure after the close, we expect our strong balance sheet will continue to provide the flexibility for 
future dividend increases and share repurchases, as well as additional business development activity. ”
Results for the second quarter of 2023  and 2022(5) are summarized below.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, Pfizer made several  organizational changes to further transform its  
operations to better leverage its expertise in certain areas and in anticipation of potential future new product and 
indication launches. These changes included establishing a new commercial structure within Biopharma focused 
on three broad customer groups (primary care, specialty care and oncology)(6), optimizing Pfizer’s end-to-end 
R&D operations and further prioritizing its internal R&D portfolio, as well as realigning certain enabling and 
platform functions across the organization to ensure alignment with this new operating structure.
In addition, in the first quarter of 2023, Pfizer established an operating segment , Business Innovation,  that 
includes Pfizer CentreOne (PC1), the company’s global contract development and manufacturing organization 
and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients; and Pfizer Ignite, a recently launched 
offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&D services to select innovative biotech companies that 
align with Pfizer’s R&D focus areas.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION
During the first six months of  2023 , Pfizer deployed its capital in a variety of ways, which primarily include the 
following two categories:
▪Reinvesting capital into initiatives intended to enhance the future growth prospects of the company, 
including $5.2 billion  invested in internal research and development projects, and
▪Returning capital directly to shareholders through $4.6 billion  of cash dividends, or $0.82 per share of 
common stock. 
No share repurchases have been completed to date in 2023. As of August 1, 2023 , Pfizer’s remaining share 
repurchase authorization is $3.3 billion . Current financial guidance does not anticipate any share repurchases in 
2023.
Second-quarter  2023  diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate Reported(2) and Adjusted(3) 
diluted EPS were 5,713 million  shares.
2023 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE(4)
Pfizer narrowed its 2023 revenue guidance range to $67 to $70 billion, while maintaining its guidance for 
Adjusted diluted EPS(3). The Company’s updated guidance is presented below . 
Revenues$67.0 to $70.0 billion
(previously $67.0 to $71.0 billion)
Adjusted(3) Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenues 28.0% to 30.0%
Adjusted(3) SI&A Expenses $13.8 to $14.8 billion
Adjusted(3) R&D Expenses $12.4 to $13.4 billion
Acquired IPR&D Expenses(4)Approximately $0.1 billion
Adjusted(3) Other (Income)/Deductions Approximately $1.5 billion of income
Effective Tax Rate on Adjusted(3) Income Approximately 15.0%
Adjusted(3) Diluted EPS $3.25 to $3.45
Changes in foreign exchange rates have had a minimal incremental impact since full-year 2023 guidance was issued. Please refer to 
Press Release Footnote (4) for additional information.
- 4 -
The midpoint of the guidance range for revenues reflects a  31% operational decrease  compared to 2022 revenues. 
Company revenues are anticipated to be lower in 2023 than in 2022 due  to expected revenue declines for Pfizer’s 
COVID-19 products, partially offset by expected operational growth from our non-COVID-19 in-line portfolio, 
anticipated new product and indication launches and recently acquired products.
Excluding COVID-19 products, Pfizer is now expecting 6% to 8% operational revenue growth in 2023. This 
reduction of the Company’s previously stated expectation of 7% to 9% non-COVID operational revenue growth  
reflects certain short-term  headwinds , such as the U.S. approval for the Talzenna plus Xtandi combination for the 
treatment of adult patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), versus an approval in the all-comers population; a shared clinical decision-
making recommendation for Abrysvo from the U.S. Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), versus a routine recommendation; and recent tornado 
damage to Pfizer’s manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, N.C. Over the longer term, the Company expects 
these short-term headwinds  to be resolved , with its revenue outlook remaining intact versus its 2030 ambitions.
Revenue guidance for Pfizer’s COVID-19 products is as follows:
▪Comirnaty(1) revenues of approximately $13.5 billion , down 64% from 2022 results.
▪Paxlovid revenues of approximately $8 billion , down 58% from 2022 results.
▪In contrast to previous years, guidance for both products is no longer based primarily on expected deliveries 
under existing signed or committed supply contracts, but now also includes, among other things, an 
anticipated transition to traditional commercial markets in the U.S. in the second half of 2023 .
The midpoint of the guidance range for Adjusted(3) diluted EPS reflects a 47% operational decrease compared to 
2022, primarily driven by anticipated lower revenues from COVID-19 products , higher spending to support 
anticipated near-term launches and greater investment in certain late-stage pipeline projects.
Financial guidance for Adjusted(3) diluted EPS is calculated using approximately 5.72 billion  weighted average 
shares outstanding, and assumes no share repurchases in 2023.

Pfizer’s 2023 financial guidance is based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant 
uncertainties, particularly with regard to the anticipated performance of Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid. See the

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS ( Second-Quarter  2023  vs. Second-Quarter  2022 ) 
Second-quarter  2023  revenues totaled $12.7 billion , a decrease of $15.0 billion , or 54%, compared to the prior-
year quarter, reflecting an operational decline of $14.7 billion , or 53%, primarily due to a decrease in Paxlovid 
and Comirnaty(1) revenues globally, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $283 million , or 1%. 
Excluding contributions from Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid, company revenues grew $537 million , or 5%, 
operationally.
Second-quarter  2023  Paxlovid revenues declined $8.0 billion , or 98%, operationally compared with the prior-year 
quarter,  primarily driven by no second quarter U.S. sales in anticipation  of transition  to traditional commercial 
markets in the second half of 2023, and lower contractual deliveries in most international markets.
Second-quarter  2023  Comirnaty(1) revenues declined $7.3 billion , or 82%, operationally compared with the prior-
year quarter, largely driven by lower contracted deliveries and demand in international markets and lower U.S. 
government contracted deliveries, with anticipated  transition to new variant vaccines globally and to traditional 
U.S. commercial market sales in the second half of 2023.
Excluding contributions from Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid, second-quarter 2023 operationa l revenue g rowth was 
primarily driven by:
▪Recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, which contributed $247 million  and $77 
million  in global revenues , respectively ; and
▪Vyndaqel family (Vyndaqel, Vyndamax, Vynmac) globally, up 43% operationally, largely driven by 
continued strong uptake of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) indication, primarily in 
the U.S. and developed Europe ;
partially offset primarily by lower revenues for:
▪Inflectra in the U.S., down 81%, primarily driven by  lower net price  as a result of unfavorable changes in 
channel mix; and
- 6 -
▪Ibrance, down 4% operationally, primarily driven by lower demand globally  due to competitive pressure, 
lower clinical trial purchases internationally  and planned  price decreases in certain international developed 
markets.

Second-quarter  2023  Cost of Sales(2) as a percentage of revenues decrease d by 5.8 percentage points compared 
with the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by favorable changes in sales mix, including lower sales of 
Comirnaty(1) and, to a much lesser  extent, by lower  write-offs for Comirnaty(1) inventory  that exceeded or was 
expected to exceed its approved shelf life prior to being used; partially offset by lower sales of Paxlovid .
Second-quarter  2023  SI&A Expenses(2) increase d 16% operationally compared with the prior-year quarter, 
primarily reflecting increased investments to support recently acquired and launched products and the expected 
Paxlovid commercial launch , as we ll as an increase in deferred compensation savings plan expenses , partially 
offset by a lower provision for U.S. healthcare  reform fees associated with lower sales  of Paxlovid and 
Comir naty(1).
Second-quarter  2023  R&D Expenses(2) decrease d 5% operationally compared with the prior-year quarter, 
primarily driven by lower spending on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19 and a decrease in the value of the 
portfolio performance share grants reflecting the decrease in the price of Pfizer’s common stock in the second 
quarter of 2023; partially offset by increased investments to develop recently acquired assets and certain vaccine 
programs, as well as ac tivities to support upcoming product launches .
Pfizer recorded $347 million of other income––net(2) in the second quarter  of 2023  compared with $772 million of 
other deductions––net(2) in the second quarter  of 2022 . The period-over-period change was primarily driven by: 
▪net gains on equity securities in the second  of quarte r 2023 versus net losses on equity securities 
recognized in the prior-year quarter; and

▪net periodic benefit credits associated with pension and postretirement plans incurred in the second  
quarter  of 2023 versus net periodic benefit costs recognized in the second quarter of 202 2.
Pfizer’s effective tax rate on Reported income(2) for the second quarter  of 2023  is negative primarily due to tax 
benefits in the second quarter of 2023 related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions 
spanning multiple tax years and a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.

RECENT NOTABLE  DEVELOPMENTS (Since May 2, 2023 )
Product Developments
▪Abrysvo  (Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine) – Older Adults
•In May 2023, Pfizer announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Abrysvo, 
the company’s bivalent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prefusion F (RSVpreF) vaccine, for the 
prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years and older. The 
CDC ’s ACIP subsequently recommended Abrysvo for use in adults 60 years of age and older, using 
shared clinical  decision making . This recommendation was published in the CDC’s Morbidity and 
Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) in July 2023, triggering  the initiation of Medicare and 
Commercial coverage . 
•In July 2023, Pfizer announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting 
of a marketing authorization for RSVpreF for older adults. The CHMP’s positive opinion will now 
- 8 -
be reviewed by the EC. The EC will take the CHMP’s recommendation under advisement to decide 
whether to approve RSVpreF, whose trade name in the European Union (EU) will be Abrysvo. The 
EC’s final decision is expected in the coming weeks.
•In June 2023, Pfizer presented for the first time an analysis of initial vaccine efficacy data for mid-
RSV season two in the Northern Hemisphere from the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trial in older adults, 
as well as presented p ositive top-line result s from a Phase 3 study that support the coadministration 
of Abrysvo with flu vaccine in older adults at the CDC’s ACIP June meeting . 
▪Abrysvo (Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine) – Maternal Immunization for Infants
•In July 2023, Pfizer announced that the CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion, 
recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for RSVpreF for maternal immunization to 
help protect infants. The CHMP’s positive opinion will now be reviewed by the EC. The EC will 
take the CHMP’s recommendation under advisement to decide whether to approve RSVpreF, whose 
trade name in the EU will be Abrysvo. The EC’s final decision is expected in the coming weeks.
•In May 2023, Pfizer announced that the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory 
Committee (VRBPAC) v oted that available data  are adequate to support the efficacy and safety  of its 
RSVpreF vaccine candidate for pregnant individuals to help prevent RSV disease in infants. The 
vaccine is currently under FDA review for the prevention of medically attended lower respiratory 
tract disease (MA-LRTD) and severe MA-LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six 
months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals.  The role of the VRBPAC is to 
provide recommendations to the FDA; however, these recommendations are not binding. The 
Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA is in August 2023,  
followed by  discussion at a meeting of the ACIP .
▪Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib)  – In June 2023, Pfizer announced the first detailed 
results from the Phase 2 PHAROS study, which is e valua ting the efficacy and safety of Braftovi given in 
combination with Mektovi to patients with BRAF  V600E-mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). The results were presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual 
Meeting and simultaneously published in the  Journal of Clinical Oncology . The FDA is reviewing the 
company’s Supplemental New Drug Applications (sNDAs) for Braftovi + Mektovi for patients with 
metastatic NSCLC with a BRAF  V600E mutation based on the results from the PHAROS trial with a 
PDUFA goal date for a decision by the FDA in fourth quarter 2023.
▪Comirnaty (COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA )(8)
•In June 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech SE (BioNTech) announced the companies have submitted 
- 9 -
regulatory applications to the FDA and EMA for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent 
COVID-19 vaccine for the 2023-2024 fall and winter season.  These filings follow guidance from the 
FDA’s VRBPAC, EMA and other health authorities that updated vaccines targeting Omicron XBB.1 
sublineages may help to protect against COVID-19 during the upcoming fall and winter season.  The 
companies expect to be ready to ship the adapted vaccines immediately upon regulatory 
authorization/approval.
•In May 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech  announced they have reached an agreement with the EC to 
amend their existing contract to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to the EU. The amended agreement 
includes rephasing of delivery of doses annually through 2026 and an aggregate volume reduction, 
providing additional flexibility for EU Member States. The EC will maintain access to future 
adapted COVID-19 vaccines and the ability to donate doses, in alignment with the original 
agreement.
▪Litfulo (ritlecitinib)
•In July 2023, Pfizer announced that the CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion for Litfulo—
a kinase inhibito r that inhibits Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and the tyrosine kinase expressed in 
hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) family of kinases—recommending marketing authorization of once-
daily 50 mg for individuals 12 years of age and older with severe alopecia areata. The EC will 
review the CHMP recommendation and is expected to make a final decision in the coming months.
•In June 2023, Pfizer announced the FDA approved Litfulo, a once-daily oral treatment, for 
individuals 12 years of age and older with severe alopecia areata. Litfulo is the first and only 
treatment approved by the FDA for adolescents (12+) with severe alopecia areata.
▪Ngenla (somatrogon-ghla)  – In June 2023, Pfizer and OPKO Health Inc. announced the FDA approved 
Ngenla, a once-weekly, human growth hormone analog for the treatment of pediatric patients aged three 
years and older who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone. Ngenla 
is approved for the treatment of pediatric growth hormone deficiency in more than 40 markets including 
Canada, Australia, Japan, and EU Member States.
▪Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablet s)(8) – In May 2023, Pfizer announced the FDA 
approved Paxlovid for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for 
progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Paxlovid has been available in the U.S. 
since December 2021 under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and the overall benefit/risk profile and 
indication for use in eligible adults remain consistent with the EUA. At this time,  the U.S. government will 
continue to oversee the distribution of Paxlovid, but Pfizer expects a transition to  traditional commercial 
markets in the second half of the ye ar.

▪Prevnar 20 (20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine)  – In June 2023, Pfizer announced the CDC’s 
ACIP unanimously voted to recommend  Prevnar 20 for routine vaccination for all children under two years 
of age, for eligible children aged 2-18 years with certain underlying medical conditions, and a catch-up dose 
for children with an incomplete pneumococcal conjugate vaccine vaccination status .
▪Talzenna (talazoparib)  – In June 2023, Pfizer announced the FDA approved Talzenna, an oral poly ADP-
ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in combination with Xtandi (enzalutamide), for the treatment of adult 
patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (mCRPC). The approval was based on the statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) data from the Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial. A Marketing 
Authorization Application (MAA) for the Talzenna and Xtandi combination has been accepted for review by 
the EMA, and Pfizer has shared data with additional regulatory agencies to support regulatory f ilings .
Pipeline Developments
A comprehensive update of Pfizer’s development pipeline was published today and is now available at 
www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline. It includes an overview of Pfizer’s research and a list of 
compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as mechanism of action 
for some candidates in Phase 1 and all candidates from Phase 2 through registration.
▪Aztreonam-avibactam (PF-06947387) – In June 2023, Pfizer announced positive results from the Phase 3 
program comprising the REVISIT (NCT03329092) and ASSEMBLE (NCT03580044) studies evaluating the 
efficacy, safety and tolerability of the novel investigational antibiotic combination aztreonam-avibactam 
(ATM-AVI) in treating serious bacterial infections due to Gram-negative bacteria, including metallo-β-
lactamase (MBL)-producing multidrug-resistant pathogens for which there are limited or no treatment 
options. Data support that ATM-AVI is effective and well-tolerated, with no new safety findings and a 
similar safety profile to aztreonam alone. Data from the REVISIT and ASSEMBLE studies are expected to 
form the basis for planned regulatory filings in the EU, United Kingdom, China and the U.S.  in the second 
half of 2023 . Pfizer holds the global rights to commercialize ATM-AVI outside of the U.S. and Canada, 
where the rights are held by its development partner, AbbVie.
▪Danuglipron (PF-06882961) – In June 2023, Pfizer announced its decision to continue to advance its oral 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) candidate danuglipron toward late-stage development 
for the potential treatment of adults with obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, subject to results from the 
ongoing Phase 2 trial; and to discontinue the clinical development of a second GLP-1RA candidate 
lotiglipron (PF-07081532). The company expects to finalize plans for the danuglipron late-stage program by 
the end of 2023 and also is developing a once-daily modified release version.

▪Elranatamab (PF-06863135)  – In June 2023, Pfizer announced updated data from the MagnetisMM clinical 
development program for elranatamab, an investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CD3-targeted 
bispecific antibody (BsAb) currently being investigated i n multiple myeloma (MM). Data across 13 abstracts 
were shared at the 2023 ASCO Annual Meeting, including new data from the Phase 2 MagnetisMM-3 
clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who were previously treated 
with BCMA-directed therapy, supporting the safety and efficacy of elranatamab regardless of prior BCMA-
directed treatment history. Additional presentations included new 15-month data from BCMA-naïve patients, 
subgroup analyses among difficult-to-treat patient populations, real-world treatment patterns for triple-class 
refractory MM and indirect comparisons/comparative effectiveness between elranatamab and other therapies. 
Elranatamab is currently under review by regulatory agencies, including the FDA , which has granted priority 
review for the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA) in RRMM with a PDUFA date in August  
2023.
▪Fidanacogene elaparvovec (Hemophilia B Gene Therapy) – In June 2023, Pfizer announced the FDA 
accepted for review the company’s BLA for  fidanacogene elaparvovec for the treatment of adults with 
hemophilia B and that the European MAA  for fidanacogene elaparvovec also has been accepted and is under 
review by the EMA . Fidanacogene elaparvovec is a novel  investigational gene therapy that contains a bio-
engineered adeno-associated virus capsid and a high-activity variant of human coagulation Factor IX gene. 
The FDA has set a PDUFA goal date in the second quarter of 2024.
▪GBS6 (PF-06760805, Group B Streptococcus Vaccine)  – In July 2023, Pfizer announced data from a 
Phase 2 study investigating its hexavalent capsular polysaccharide (CPS) conjugate Group B Streptococcus 
(GBS) vaccine candidate, GBS6, being developed for maternal administration to protect infants against 
invasive GBS disease. In stage two of the three-part study, which enrolled 360 healthy pregnant individuals, 
GBS6 generated robust maternal antibody responses against the six GBS CPS serotypes included in the 
vaccine, and these antibodies were efficiently transferred to infants at ratios of ~0.4-1.3 depending on GBS6 
group. Based on a parallel natural history study conducted in South Africa, the Phase 2 study 
immunogenicity data suggest that GBS6 may offer meaningful protection against invasive GBS disease in 
newborns and young infants. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and will 
inform a planned Phase 3 clinical development program. GBS6 was granted PRIME  designation by the 
EMA’s CHMP  and has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. FDA.
▪Marstacimab (PF-06741086) – In May 2023, Pfizer announced that the pivotal Phase 3 BASIS  clinical trial 
(NCT03938792) evaluating marstacimab met its primary endpoints, having demonstrated statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful effects. Marstacimab is a novel,  investigational anti-tissue factor 
pathway inhibitor (anti-TFPI) being studied for the treatment of hemophilia A or B for people with and 
without inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX. The BASIS trial demonstrated that prophylactic treatment 
- 12 -
with marstacimab resulted in a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect on annualized bleeding 
rate in people living with severe hemophilia A and moderately severe to severe hemophilia B without 
inhibitors . Analyses of the full Phase 3 dataset are ongoing, and results will be presented at an upcoming 
scientific conference. Pfizer will discuss these data with regulatory authorities, with the goal of initiating 
regulatory filings in the coming months. The inhibitor cohort of the BASIS trial is completing enrollment 
and is expected to read out as early as late 2024.
Corporate Develop ments
▪In July 2023, Pfizer announced changes to its executive leadership team to further advance its aspirations to 
discover and develop new medicines and vaccines, with an emphasis on oncology. Chris Boshoff, M.D., 
Ph.D., has joined Pfizer’s Executive Leadership Team as Chief Oncology Research and Development 
Officer and Executive Vice President reporting to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Albert Bourla. 
Under his leadership, Pfizer will continue to invest in its fight against cancer , and Dr. Boshoff will be the 
single point of accountability for the entire oncology pipeline—from discovery to early - and late-phase 
clinical development. Mikael Dolsten, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, President, Pfizer Research & 
Development, has expanded his role to lead all discovery, early- and late-stage clinical development for all 
non-oncology therapeutic areas, including Vaccines, Inflammation and Immunology, Internal Medicine and 
Infectious Diseases as well as non-malignant hematology and rare neuromuscular diseases. As a result of 
these moves , William Pao, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer and Executive Vice President, will be 
leaving Pfizer to pursue new opportunities outside the company.
▪In July 2023, Pfizer and Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship) announced the companies have partnered to 
create a new pipeline of innovative medicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, Flagship and Pfizer 
will each invest $ 50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset programs by 
leveraging Flagship’s ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology 
platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an option to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and 
its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million  in milestones and royalties for each 
successfully commercialized program.
▪In May 2023, Pfizer completed  a $31 billion debt offering  consisting of eight tranches of notes (collectively, 
the “Notes”). The Notes were issued by Pfizer’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Pfizer Investment Enterprises Pte. 
Ltd., and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Pfizer. Pfizer intends to use 
the net proceeds of the offering as part of the financing for Pfizer’s proposed acquisition of Seagen  Inc.
▪In May 2023, Pfizer and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. announced they have entered into a collaboration 
agreement to help increase local access for next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based testing for lung and 
breast cancer patients in more than 30 countries across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia 
- 13 -
where advanced genomic testing has previously been limited or unavailable. Under the agreement, Pfizer 
will explore ways to enable affordable patient access for NGS testing in these cancers and work to raise 
healthcare provider awareness regarding the benefits of advanced testing .
Additional Developments
▪In July 2023, Pfizer announced the company’s immediate efforts to provide relief and repair the damage 
caused to its manufacturin g facility in Rocky Mount, N.C., after a tornado swept through the town. The 
facility is a key producer of sterile injectables and is responsible for manufacturing nearly 25 percent of all 
Pfizer’s sterile injectables—including anesthesia, analgesia, therapeutics, anti-infectives and neuromuscular 
blockers—which is nearly eight percent of all the sterile injectables used in U.S. hospitals. Most of the 
damage was caused to the warehouse facility, which stores raw materials, packaging supplies and finished 
medicines. The company is working diligently to move product to other nearby sites for storage and to 
identify sources to replace damaged raw materials and supplies. It also is exploring alternative manufacturing 
locations for production across its significant manufacturing presence in the  U.S. and internationally  and 
across its partner network. After an initial assessment, there does not appear to be major damage to the 
production areas, and  Pfizer  is committed to rapidly restoring full function to the site. Pfizer and the Pfizer 
Foundation also are providing financial support to help local communities affected by the natural disaste r.
▪In June 2023, Pfizer announced it entered into a manufacturing capacity reservation agreement with the 
European Health and Digital Executive Agency of the EC, which provides the EU access to doses of an 
mRNA-based vaccine should one be developed to protect against a future pandemic-causing disease. The 
company will continue to pursue similar agreements with other countries and multi-lateral organizations , 
building on the reliability and partnerships forged during the COVID-19 pandemic response.

(1) As used in this document, “Comirnaty” refers to, as applicable, and as authorized or approved, the Pfizer-
BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron 
BA.4/BA.5), the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 Vaccine, and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4/
BA.5 Vaccine.  In the U.S., the original monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  is no longer emergency use 
authorized or CDC-recommended, although Comirnaty remains a licensed vaccine. “Comirnaty” includes 
direct sales and alliance revenues related to sales of the above-mentioned vaccines, which are recorded 
within Pfizer’s Primary Care customer group. It does not include revenues for certain Comirnaty-related 
manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech, which are included in the Pfizer CentreOne 
contract development and manufacturing organization.  Revenues related to these manufacturing activities 
totaled  $6 million  and $10 million  for the  second quarter  and the first six months of  2023 , respectively, and  
$55 million  and $101 million  for the  second quarter  and the first six months of  2022 , respectively . 
(2) Revenues is defined as revenues in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP). Reported net income and its components are defined as net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. 
common shareholders and its components in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reported diluted earnings per 
share (EPS) is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders in accordance with 
U.S. GAAP.
(3) Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS are defined as U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Pfizer 
Inc. common shareholders and Reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders 
before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued 
operations and certain significant items.  See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP Reported 
to Non-GAAP Adjusted information for the  second quarter  and the first six months of  2023  and 2022 . 
Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be 
viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS(2). See the Non-
GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income  section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Pfizer’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K  and the 
accompanying Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income  section of  this press release for a 
definition of each component of Adjusted income as well as other relevant information.   
(4) Pfizer does not provide guidance for GAAP Reported financial measures (other than revenues and 
acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) expenses) or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to the most directly comparable GAAP Reported financial measures on a forward-looking basis 
because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of unusual gains and losses, 
certain acquisition-related expenses, gains and losses from equity securities, actuarial gains and losses 
from pension and postretirement plan remeasurements, potential future asset impairments and pending 
- 15 -
litigation without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could 
have a material impact on GAAP Reported results for the guidance period.
Financial guidance for full-year 2023 reflects the following:
▪Does not assume the completion of any business development transactions not completed as of  July 2, 
2023 , except for signed transactions, if any, through mid-July 2023, which are expected to give rise to  
acquired IPR&D expenses during fiscal 2023 .
▪Reflects an  anticipated negative revenue impact of  approximately $0.2 billion  due to recent and 
expected generic and biosimilar competition for certain products that have recently lost patent 
protection or that are anticipated to lose patent protection during fiscal-year 2023.  
▪Reflects expected impacts from certain short-term  headwinds , such as the U.S. approval for the 
Talzenna plus Xtandi combination for the treatment of adult patients with HRR gene-mutated 
mCRPC, versus an approval in the all-comers population; a shared-clinical decision-making 
recommendation for Abrysvo from the CDC’s ACIP, versus a routine recommendation; and recent 
tornado damage to Pfizer’s facility in Rocky Mount, N.C. 
▪Exchange rates assumed are a blend of actual rates in effect through the  second quarter  of 2023  and 
end of June 2023  rates  for the remainder of the year. Financial guidance reflects the anticipated 
unfavorable impact of approximately  $0.7 billion  on revenues and approximately  $0.16  on Adjusted(3) 
diluted EPS as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to 
foreign exchange rates from 2022.  
▪Guidance for Adjusted(3) diluted EPS assumes diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of 
approximately 5.72 billion  shares, and assumes no share repurchases in 2023.
(5) Pfizer’s fiscal year-end for international subsidiaries is November 30 while Pfizer’s fiscal year-end for 
U.S. subsidiaries is December 31. Therefore, Pfizer’s  second quarter and first six months  for U.S. 
subsidiaries reflects the  three and six months  ended on  July 2, 2023  and July 3, 2022 , while Pfizer’s  second 
quarter and first six months  for subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. reflects the  three and six months  
ended on  May 28, 2023  and May 29, 2022 .
(6) Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, Pfizer made several organizational changes to further transform its 
operations to better leverage its expertise in certain areas and in anticipation of potential future new 
product and indication launches. Biopharma, Pfizer’s innovative science-based biopharmaceutical 
business, is operating under a new commercial structure designed to better support and optimize 
performance across three broad customer groups:
- 16 -
▪Primary Care, consisting of the former Internal Medicine and Vaccines product portfolios, products 
for COVID-19 prevention and treatment, and potential future mRNA and antiviral products.
▪Specialty Care, consisting of the former Inflammation & Immunology, Rare Disease and Hospital 
(excluding Paxlovid) product portfolios.
▪Oncology, consisting of the former Oncology product portfolio.
(7) References to operational variances  in this press release pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude 
the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although exchange rate changes are part of Pfizer’s business, they 
are not within Pfizer’s control, and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, 
Pfizer believes presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful 
information to evaluate Pfizer’s results.
(8) The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) and certain uses 
of Paxlovid have not been approved or licensed by the FDA.  The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, 
Bivalent has been authorized by the FDA under an EUA to prevent COVID-19 in individuals aged 6 
months and older. Paxlovid has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA under an EUA for the 
treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 
40 kg) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. The 
emergency uses are only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying 
the authorization of emergency use of the medical product during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 
564(b)(1) of the FFDCA unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. Please see 
the EUA Fact Sheets at www.covid19oralrx.com and www.cvdvaccine-us.com .

Adjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance as a 
supplement to our GAAP Reported performance measures. As such, we believe that investors’ understanding of our 
performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income and 
Adjusted diluted EPS to present the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, 
sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide––prior to considering certain income statement elements as 
follows:

(b)Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we no longer exclude any expenses for acquired IPR&D from our non-GAAP Adjusted results but we continue to 
exclude certain of these expenses for our financial results for annual incentive compensation purposes. 
Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized 
meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized 
definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit 
investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they 
provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our 
performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable 
GAAP measures of  Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders , components of Net income attributable to 
Pfizer Inc. common shareholders  and EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders—diluted , respectively.
We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our 
performance-management process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of 
performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In 
addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a 
significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.
