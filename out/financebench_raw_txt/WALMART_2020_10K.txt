The Development of Our Company
Although Walmart was incorpor
ated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened afranchise Ben Franklin vari
ety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, ourfounders' business was devoted entir
ely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened inRogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, 
and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart NeighborhoodMarket. In 1991, we began our first 
international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expandedand, as of 
January 31, 2020 , our Walmart Intern ational segment conducted business in 26  countries.In 2000, we began our first eCommer
ce initiative by creating walmart.com and then later that year, adding samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence hascontinued to grow. In 2007, leveraging ou
r physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pickup merchandise in stores. Sinc
e 2016, we have made several eCommerce acquisitions which have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, as wellas incubate digitally
-native brands and expand our assortment on walmart.com and in stores. In fiscal 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping and wecreated Store N
o 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive eCommerce innovation. Then in fiscal 2019, we continued to enhance our eCommerce initiativeswith the acquisition of a m
ajority stake of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart"), an Indian-based eCommerc e marketplace, with an ecosystem that inc ludeseCommerce platforms o
f Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.In fiscal 2020, we launched NextDay Del
ivery to more than 75  percent of the U.S. population, launched Delivery Unlimited from 1,600  locations in the U.S. and expanded Same Day Pickup to nearly 
3,200  locations. Our eCommerce e fforts and innovation have also led to omni-channel offerings in many of our marketsincluding grocery pick up and/o
r delivery in nearly a dozen countries outside the U.S. To date, we now have more than 6,100 grocery pick up and deliverylocations globally. We a
re enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites, supply chain combined with our morethan 
2.2 million  associates to better s erve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates customer relationships wherecustomers view Walmart as t
heir primary destination.7

e define our segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews toanalyze performanc

t contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for theWalmart International segment due
 to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We sell similar individual products and services in each of our segments. It isimpracticable to s
egregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.We measure the resul
ts of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overheadallocations. From time 
to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by theinformation regular
ly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to becomparable to the cur
rent period's presentation.Walmart U.S. Segment

ad net sales of $120.8 billion  and $118.1 billion  for fiscal 2019  and 2018 , respectively. The segmen t's net sales were negativelyimpacted by currency ex
change rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of itsmerchandise mix.

Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of themarkets it operates. 
We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainableand profitable growth. As such, we have t
aken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including:•
Acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018.•
Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (“Advent”) in August 2018. •
Divestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations  in December 2018 and the divest iture of the Walmart Canada banking operations  in April 2019. Omni-channel.
 Walmart International provides an omni-channel exp erience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through services like "Click & Collect" in the United Kingdo
m, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India, and adigital transaction p
latform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India.Generally, retail units' 
selling area range in size from 1,400  square feet to 186,000  square feet. Our wholesale sto res' selling area generally range in size from25,000
 square feet to 156,000  square feet. As of January 31, 2020 , Walmart Interna tional had nearly 3,200 grocery pickup and/or delivery locations across itsmarkets.
Merchandise.
 The merchandising strat egy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope ofmerchandise offered 
for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developedmarket specific pr
ivate brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate,""George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "M
ainstays," "Marketside" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brandsincluding "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "L
ider," "Myntra," "PhonePe" and "Extra Special." In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and localsuppliers in each marke
t to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.Operations.
 The hours of operation for oper ating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon localand national ordinances gove
rning hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods.Seasonal Aspects of Operations.
 Walmart Interna tional's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operatingincome have occurred in 
the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays,festivals and customs, as wel
l as different weather patterns.Competition.
 Walmart Interna tional competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets,hypermarkets and supercen
ter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores,and eCommerce retai
lers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and oper ate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience l
argely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price l eadership is a critical part of our business model andwe continue to focus on moving our ma
rkets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impacton our competitive position 
in the markets where we operate.Distribution.
 We utilize a total of 221  distribution facilities located in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, India andthe United Kingdom. Certain of thes
e facilities are used to ship merchandise to both our stores and customers on our eCommerce platforms. Through thesefacilities, we process 
and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2020 , approximately 
85%  of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of Walmart International'spurchases directly to our s
tores in the various markets in which we operate. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by anumber of methods from mul
tiple locations including from our 88  dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as more than 2,500  eCommerce sort centers in India.

44  states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club hadnet sales of 
$58.8 billion  for fiscal 2020 , representing 11%  of our consolidated fiscal 2020 net sales, and had net sales of $57.8 billion  and $59.2 billion  for fiscal 2019
 and 2018 , respectively. As a membe rship-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam'sClub operates with a lower gross prof
it rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.10

lly, most club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday,starting at 7:00 a.m. A vari
ety of payment methods are accepted. Consistent with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop technology tools to drive a greatmember experience 
in club. For example, Sam's Garage, a new application in its tire and battery business, is leveraging technology in new ways to provide apersonalized and effi
cient shopping experience. Sam's Club also offers "Scan and Go," a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypassthe checkout line.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations.
 Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a ce rtain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well asdifferent weather pa
tterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.Competition.
 Sam's Club competes with other me mbership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail andwholesale grocers, genera
l merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. AtSam's Club, we provide value at memb
ers-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. OureCommerce website and m
obile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.Distribution.
 During fiscal 2020 , approximately 73%  of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from Sam's Club's 25  dedicated distribution facilities,located strategic
ally throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certainitems. Suppliers shipped the ba
lance of the Sam's Club segment's club purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased onsamsclub.com and through its mob
ile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from Clubs, nine dedicated eCommercefulfillment centers, two de
dicated import facilities and other distribution centers.11

Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.The segment contracts 
with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, 
service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual propertyas important to our success, 
and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, andconfidentiality and/o
r license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and internationaldomain names, tradema
rks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietarytechnology. We have licens
ed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.Suppliers and Supply Chain
As a retailer and warehouse 
club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the U.S.,from whom we purchase the mer
chandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near thestores and clubs in which such mer
chandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of theannual sales for a number o
f our suppliers, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers.Our suppliers are subject to s
tandards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicablelaws. Our ability to acquire 
from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within therequired time through our supp
ly chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs andthe attractiveness o
f our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.Employees
As of the end of fiscal 
2020 , Walmart Inc. and our subsid iaries employed more than 2.2 million  employees ("associates" ) worldwide, with 1.5 million  associates in the U.S. and 
0.7 million  associates internat ionally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates. Webelieve our relationsh
ips with our associates are good. A large number of associates turn over each year, although Walmart U.S. turnover has improved in recentyears as a result of our fo
cus on increasing wages and providing improved tools, technology and training to associates.Certain information relating t
o retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11  to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements. In additionto retirement-r
elated benefits, in the U.S. we offer a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates. These include a store discount card or Sam's Clubmembership, bonuses based on Company per
formance, matching a portion of associate purchases of our stock through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and lifeinsurance. In addition
 to the health-care benefits for eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S., we offer maternity leave and a paid parental leaveprogram to all full-
time associates. We also offer a $5,000 benefit to assist eligible associates with adoption. Additionally, we offer eligible associates tuitionassistance towards earning 
a college degree through "Live Better U," which allows associates to earn a college degree or certificate for the equivalent of $1 per day.Similarly, in our operat
ions outside the U.S., we provide a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.12

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS The risks described below could, in ways we 
may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations,financial condition and 
liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.The following risk factors do not 
identify all risks that we may face.Strategic Risks
General or macro-economi
c factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.General economic conditio
ns and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.Higher interest rates, 
lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and otherenergy, weakness in the housing mark
et, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels ofunemployment, decreases 
in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending andshopping patterns, fluctuat
ions in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, otherregulatory changes, the
 imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economicslowdown or recession and other econom
ic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for theproducts we sell in the U.S. or such other 
markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionarypurchases of goods, adversely af
fect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adverselyaffect our operations 
and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.In addition, the economic 
factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costsor commodity prices, and oth
er economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, generaland administrative expense
s and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.The economic factors th
at affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of thegoods we sell to our customers or, in 
more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.We face strong competition fro
m other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Each of our segments compet
es for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many otherlocal, regional, national a
nd global eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries.We compete in a vari
ety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers,location, store hours, in-sto
re amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digitalplatforms, cost and speed of 
and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integrationof our physical and digital op
erations.14

A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materiallyadversely affect our financial 
performance. See "Item 1. Business " above for additional discuss ion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.Certain segments of the r
etail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retailmarketplace. Other seg
ments are substantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions.Such consolidation, or other business 
combinations or alliances, or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources,improved access to mer
chandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such businesscombinations or allian
ces could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies,which could adversel
y affect our financial performance.If we do not timely identify or eff
ectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.
It is difficult to pr
edict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success ofour business depends in part on how accur
ately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing productsand the competitive env
ironment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are ofprimary importance to customer
s and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and thechoices available to 
consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shoppingpatterns, or any other fa
ilure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negativelyaffect our relat
ionship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business.Failure to successfully execute our o
mni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affectour market position, net sales and financial performanc
e.The retail business continu
es to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures withretailers and wholesale clu
bs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate.Our strategy, which includes inves
tments in eCommerce, technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequatelyor effectively al
low us to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset theimpact on the growth of our business o
f a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our abilityto continue building and deliv
ering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A
. Failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result inimpairment charges 
to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocerysales, could result in a r
eduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales ofmerchandise that such traffic create
s and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.Furthermore, the cost of c
ertain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performancein the short-term and failure
 to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.The performance of strategic al
liances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect ourfinancial performance.
We may enter into str
ategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retailoperations. These arrange
ments may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact ourbusiness and competitive posi
tion relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connectionwith a strategic alliance or 
business relationship could materially adversely affect our financial performance.15

Operational RisksNatural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-polit
ical events and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.The occurrence of one or mo
re natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditionssuch as major or extended wint
er storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; geo-politicalevents; global health ep
idemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak; and catastrophic events, such aswar, civil unrest, terro
rist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), in countries inwhich we operate or in which our suppli
ers are located, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Such events could result in physic
al damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distributionfacilities, lim
itations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or havetransportation to our stor
es and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities arelocated, the unavailab
ility of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits byconsumers to physical ret
ail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers'disposable income, the te
mporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, thedisruption or delay in the de
livery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability ofproducts in our stores, the disrup
tion of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores. For example, ourresults for the fourth qua
rter of fiscal 2020 were negatively impacted by riots and looting in Chile which resulted in us closing a number of our stores until thedisruption abated.
We bear the risk of losses 
incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory andbusiness interruption caused by su
ch events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which theyoccur and could materially a
dversely affect our financial performance.Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adverse
ly affect our financial performance.The products we sell are sourc
ed from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an importantfactor in our financi
al performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, andto otherwise meet our requ
ired supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timelyand efficient manne
r, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.Political and economic 
instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located(such as the recent coron
avirus outbreak which could result in potential disruptions or delays to our global supply chain), the financial instability of suppliers,suppliers' failure to m
eet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by oursuppliers and their manuf
acturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation ofmerchandise from the supp
liers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a materialamount of merchandise we pur
chase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security,inflation and other fa
ctors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.In addition, the U.S. foreign trad
e policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on theimportation of cert
ain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond ourcontrol. These and other fa
ctors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.If the products we sell are not safe or otherwis
e fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries sufferedby customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise exper
ience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. Weare also subject to reputational and other risks re
lated to third-party sales on our digital platforms.Our customers count on us to provide th
em with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers orthat we prepare and then se
ll could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food andnon-food needs, even if the basis 
for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly toreestablish and such products 
also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items wesell, regardless of the 
cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition,16

third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to such sales apply to us is currentlyunsettled and any unfavorabl
e changes could expose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we mayface reputational, 
financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit or otherwise fail to comply withapplicable law. Although we impose 
contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect,enforce, or collect su
fficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results ofoperations and impede the 
execution of our eCommerce growth strategy.We rely extensively on informat
ion systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harmour ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual 
transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems.Our information systems ar
e subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, othermalicious computer programs
, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations includingnation states), catas
trophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systemsare essential to our busin
ess operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores andclubs and our online operations. Our 
information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If oursystems are damaged, bre
ached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss orcorruption of critic
al data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a materialadverse effect on our busin
ess or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems. The risk ofsystem disruption is incre
ased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, wemay fail to realize the cost sa
vings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.If the technology-based systems that give our custom
ers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as ourability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materia
lly adversely affected.Increasingly, customers 
are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use socialmedia, online advertis
ing, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel salesstrategy, in addition to hom
e delivery, we offer various pickup and delivery programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked upby the customer or membe
r at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is arapidly evolving part of th
e retail industry and of our operations around the world. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations whileadjusting for technology inves
tments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shoppingexperience across al
l channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wideassortment of merchand
ise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of onlineshoppers and developments in onlin
e and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss ofeCommerce and other sal
es, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have amaterial adverse 
impact on our business and results of operations.Our digital platforms, which 
are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run,including those applicat
ions and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gainunauthorized access to 
our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members'information including pay
ment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A. Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse, may alsocreate denials of se
rvice or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' andmembers' shopping experienc
e. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we couldsuffer loss of sales, reduc
tions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers orothers whose personal or confiden
tial information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our businessand results of operations and 
impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.17

Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result ofcybersecurity attacks on our information syst
ems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause usto incur substantial additional costs, and materially advers
ely affect our business and operating results.Like most retailers, we 
receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personalinformation concerning ou
r associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-partyservice providers for a v
ariety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-officesupport, and other functions. Such provid
ers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, oureCommerce operations dep
end upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.Cyber threats are rapid
ly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasinglysophisticated. Cyber threa
ts and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide rangeof motives and expertise. 
We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including byperpetrators of random or
 targeted malicious cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts tomisappropriate custom
er information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Some of our systems have experienced limitedsecurity breaches and a
lthough they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.Associate error or mal
feasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party serviceproviders' security measu
res and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherentvulnerabilities or de
fects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromiseinformation security.
Any compromise of our data secu
rity systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained,damaged, modified, lost or us
ed by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition,remediation expenses, and 
claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of whichcould materially and 
adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorizedaccess, disable or degrad
e service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipatethese techniques or to imp
lement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability orcompromise of information f
or a significant period of time after the security incident occurs.In addition, such events could be wid
ely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors andshareholders, could harm our 
competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net salesin our eCommerce operat
ions, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition,cash flows and liquidity. Such events 
could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition andperformance and could r
esult in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by ourinsurance policies. Moreov
er, a security compromise could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue andto expend significant addi
tional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyber-attacksand other attempts to a
ccess or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations.We accept payments using 
a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offernew payment options over time, whi
ch may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subjectto various industry data prot
ection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data SecurityStandard. We cannot be cer
tain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detectcyber-attacks, cyber 
terrorism, security breaches or other compromises from known malware or other threats that may be developed in the future. To the extent thatany cyber-attack or in
cursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or othercompromise of information,
 we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment cardnetworks and others. In certa
in circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, AmericanExpress and Discover) general
ly require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if informationin connection with payment c
ards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial.18

Additionally, we offer money (wire) transfer services, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders and check cashing and we sell prepaid cards and giftcards. We further off
er co-branded credit cards and installment loans through financial services partners. These products and services require us to comply withlegal and regulatory r
equirements, including global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumerfinancial laws and regul
ations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.The Company also has compliance ob
ligations associated with new privacy laws enacted to protect personal information. The California Consumer Privacy Act of2018, (CCPA), grants California consumers c
ertain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection, use and sharing of“personal information
” of California consumers. Other U.S. states are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal information and the U.S. federalgovernment is also consider
ing federal privacy legislation. Outside the U.S., the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) greatlyincreases the jurisdi
ctional reach of EU law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data. Complying with changing regulatory requirementsrequires us to incur addit
ional costs and expenses. If we fail to comply with CCPA, GDPR or other privacy related regulations, or if regulators assert we have failedto comply with them, it could 
lead to regulatory enforcement action, monetary fines or penalties (up to 4% of worldwide revenue in the case of GDPR), lawsuits orreputational damage 
and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely af
fect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Walmart has reta
il pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, as well as the recent addition of Walmart Health Centers to some of ourU.S. stores. A large majority of our 
retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractualrelationships with third-p
arty payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").Our retail pharmacy ope
rations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e.,shifts in the relativ
e distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorablereimbursement ter
ms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwisereceive preferential coverage treatment); gr
owth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operatedby PBMs and/or any insurance plan or progr
am; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in theadministrative burdens 
associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals becomeavailable to consumers
; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drugcompetition; changes in d
rug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the healthinsurance market generally; cha
nges in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retailpharmacy operations; fu
rther consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and theability of our pharmacy 
customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performanceor incentive thresholds to whi
ch our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industryand the pharmaceutic
al industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable CareAct or the enactment and 
implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.If the supply of certain ph
armaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severelyaffected until at 
least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in asignificant number of o
ur pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.One or a combination of such fa
ctors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with ourretail pharmacy ope
rations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn,adversely affect our ov
erall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Our failure to attract and reta
in qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materiallyadversely affect our financial per
formance.Our ability to continue to condu
ct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associatesglobally. Our ability to me
et our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs,distribution centers and 
corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, includingthe availability of 
a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets,prevailing wage rates, ch
anging demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised19

employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within theCompany's senior leadership, such as ou
r recent leadership changes, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. If we areunable to locate, att
ract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decreaseand our financial performance
 may be adversely affected.In addition, if our costs of l
abor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted orimplemented that further increase 
our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.Financial Risks
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may mat
erially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.Our operations in countries oth
er than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements aredenominated in U.S. dollars, and to pr
epare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expensesof our operations outside of th
e U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currencyexchange rates that wer
e unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.As a result of such translat
ions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidatedfinancial statements reflecting sig
nificant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in ourfinancial perform
ance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange ratefluctuations will adversel
y affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on ourreported consolidated r
esults of operations.We may pay for products we purch
ase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which thegoods will be sold. When we must acquir
e the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorableto us, our cost of sales may inc
rease and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, witha corresponding adverse ef
fect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affectour results of operations.
Failure to meet market expe
ctations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.We believe that the price of 
our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting theseexpectations, including our 
comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could causethe market price of ou
r stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performanceto compare favorably to t
hat of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our international operations subject us to legis
lative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to thecountries or regions in which we operate, which could materia
lly adversely affect our business or financial performance.In addition to our U.S. operations, we oper
ate our retail business in Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the UnitedKingdom.
During fiscal 2020
, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 23%  of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in variouscountries also source goods and se
rvices from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors,most of which are beyond our contro
l. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal andregulatory constraints 
(such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerceand retail operations in i
nternational markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), local product safety andenvironmental laws, tax r
egulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulationsregarding consumer and dat
a protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.For example, during the curr
ent transition period following the UK’s recent exit from the European Union, we face continued uncertainty regarding the impact onour UK business of potential changes in 
tariffs, trade practices and other regulations while the UK and EU work to put in place alternative trade and otherarrangements.
20

The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if theyoccurred again, could a
dversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary andfiscal policies of th
e U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risksassociated with having numerous 
facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S.. Additional risks inherent in our internationaloperations generally in
clude, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty inenforcing intellec
tual property rights in countries other than the U.S.. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doingbusiness outside of the U.S., and may be exagg
erated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws andregulations.
In foreign countries in which we h
ave operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in businesspractices prohibited by U.S. laws and 
regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), or the laws and regulations of othercountries, such as the UK Bribery Act. W
e maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption complianceprogram designed to ensure co
mpliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractorsor agents, including those based 
in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries maybe customary, will engage in bus
iness practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws andregulations. Any such violations, ev
en if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely aff
ect our financial performance.In fiscal 2020, our Walma
rt U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 77%  of our consolidated net sales. The federal government hascreated the potenti
al for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countrieswhere we source many of the produc
ts we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination oftrade agreements and 
the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubsis manufactured in othe
r countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise(whether imported dire
ctly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adverselyaffect the financ
ial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.We are subject to inco
me taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. Thedetermination of our worldwid
e provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxescould be materially 
adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions that have h
igher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, taxrates, regulations or a
ccounting principles.For example, in December 2019, Ind
ia enacted a bill which significantly reduced the corporate income tax for certain companies with operations in India. In theU.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") signi
ficantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations with additional guidance from the U.S.tax authority still pend
ing. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in ourestimates will be tr
eated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act, including collecting information not regularlyproduced by the Company or unexpected 
changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations.In addition, we are subject 
to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects ofchanging tax regulation
s and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the taxamounts recorded in our consol
idated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periodsfor which such determi
nation and settlement is made.21

Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate could materially adversely affectour reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance.
We operate in complex 
regulated environments in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existinglegal requirements including
 the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations.Our pharmacy and other heal
thcare operations in the U.S. are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirementsand reimbursement ar
rangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation ofpharmacies; dispensing and s
ale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicareand Medicaid; data priv
acy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws andregulations relating 
to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of,hazardous substances; regul
ations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and the DrugEnforcement Administra
tion (the "DEA"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulationsincluding those of the Consumer Produc
t Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotionof products we sell and the fin
ancial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse andthe practice of the p
rofessions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services.For example, in the U.S. the DEA and various othe
r regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances.We are required to hold v
alid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlledsubstance acts and rela
ted regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatoryauthorities have broad en
forcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions forviolations of these laws and r
egulations.We are also governed by for
eign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions,health and safety, equal 
employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition, andantitrust matters, 
and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer ormake available, such as ou
r money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and preventmoney laundering, sanctions, f
raud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protection. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and therelated interpre
tations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulationsand policies and the relate
d interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase ouroperating costs, require s
ignificant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer.Untimely compliance or non
compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adverselyaffect the continued op
eration of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss ofauthorizations to part
icipate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; loss of licenses; andsignificant fines or mon
etary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of thecountries in which we operate 
could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our businessoperations, financial 
condition and results of operations.22

We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are involved in a numbe
r of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in anumber of cases containing 
class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number ofcases containing class-
action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("Asda"), a wholly-owned subsidia
ry of the Company, has been named as a defendant in numerous "equal value" claims pending inthe Manchester Employmen
t Tribunal (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former Asda store employees,allege that the work per
formed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of employeesworking in Asda's warehouses and distribution 
facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because morewomen work in retail stores whil
e more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimantsare seeking differen
tial back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. At present,we 
cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company has been responding to subpoenas, in
formation requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substancedispensing and distribution pra
ctices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids including the consolidatedmultidistrict litigation entitled 
In re National Prescription Opiate Lit igation (MDL No. 2804), currently pending in the U.S. Distri ct Court for the Northern Districtof Ohio. Similar cases that n
ame the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs.Plaintiffs are seeking 
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claimsthat may be filed, and c
annot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters.We discuss these cases and oth
er litigation to which we are party below under the caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings " and in Note 10  in the " Notes to our Consolidated Financial State
ments," which are part of this Annual Repor t on Form 10-K.Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delawar
e as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actionsand proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholde
rs’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputeswith us or our directors, officers, e
mployees or shareholders in such capacity.Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent 
in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullestextent permitted by l
aw, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or formerdirector, officer, 
employee or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery.This exclusive forum provision 
may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or ourdirectors, officers, 
employees or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were tofind these provisions of our bylaws in
applicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additionalcosts associated with resolv
ing such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.ITEM 1B.

The Company has received grand ju ry subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District ofPennsylvania seeking documents r
egarding the Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s moneytransfer services, wher
e Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in January 2020. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas. TheCompany has also been responding to civ
il investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission related to money transfers and the Company’santi-fraud program. Due to 
the investigative stage of these matters, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations by the governmentalentities. While the Comp
any does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition,results of operations or c
ash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financialposition, results of operat
ions or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.III. ENVIRONMENTAL 
MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires dis closure of certain environmental matters. The following matters aredisclosed in accordance wi
th that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss thatmay be incurred in connec
tion with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.In September 2018, the United Stat
es Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it had initiated an administrative penalty action byissuing a Draft Consent Agreement 
and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributedand/or sold three unregist
ered pesticide products from March to June, 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product isresponsible for ensuring tha
t a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The Company is cooperating with the EPA.In January 2018, the Environmenta
l Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of approximately$163,000 for the absence of an Environ
mental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine.In April 2017, the California Air Resou
rces Board (the "ARB") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimeddeposits collected on sal
es of small containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company hadimproperly retained 
approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has sought reimbursement. The Company has denied any wrongdoing.In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corpo
racion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality ofCurridabat is seeking a pena
lty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that issituated along a protected
 river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time ofconstruction, but the Municip
ality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.ITEM 4.

ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSI ON AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview
This discussion, which presents our resu
lts for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020  ("fiscal 2020 "), January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019 ") and January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 
2018 ") should be read in conjunction wi th our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide thereader with information that
 will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period toperiod and the primary f
actors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company'sperformance. Additional
ly, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of howeach of those segments and i
ts results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segm
ent operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of theCompany's segments using each segmen
t's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, werevise the measurem
ent of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operatingdecision maker.
Management also measures t
he results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores andclubs by measuring the change 
in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previousyear. Walmart's def
inition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansionsand conversions, as well as eComme
rce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications,including omni-channel t
ransactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparablesales when the conversion of tha
t store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than fivepercent.
 Additionally, sales rela ted to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as"same-store" sales by othe
rs within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation ofcomparable sales is not 
necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Beginning with the first quart
er of fiscal 2020, we updated our definition of what was previously referred to as traffic (a component, along with ticket, ofcomparable sales). Tr
affic is now referred to as "transactions" and measures a percentage change in the number of sales transactions in our comparable stores, aswell as for comparable 
eCommerce activity.In discussing our operating resu
lts, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countrieswhere the functional cur
rency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currencyexchange rates as the differe
nce between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior yearperiod’s currency exchang
e rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.Throughout our discussion, we refer to 
the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange ratesmay impact the resul
ts, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.Our business is seasonal to a cer
tain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest salesvolume and operating incom
e have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . We have taken strateg
ic actions to strengthen our portfolio for the long-term, including:•
Acquisition of 81 percent  of the outstanding shares, or 77 pe rcent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart") in August 2018, whichnegatively impacted 
fiscal 2020 and 2019 net income. Refer to Note 12  for additional inform ation on the transaction.•
Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International ("Advent") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion infiscal 2019. Refer to 
Note 12  for additional inform ation on the transaction.•
Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile and Walmart Canada in December 2018 and April 2019, respectively.•
Asda made a $1.0 billion cash contribution to the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the "Plan") in October 2019 which enabled the Plan to purchase a bulkinsurance annuity contra
ct for the benefit of Plan participants in anticipation that each Plan participant will be issued an individual annuity contract.  Theissuer of the individual annu
ity insurance contracts will be solely responsible for paying each participant’s benefits in full and will release the Plan andAsda from any future obligat
ions. Once all Plan participants have been issued individual annuity contracts, we currently30

estimate that we will recognize a total, pre-tax charge of approximately $2.2 billion related to the pension settlement in late fiscal 2021 or early fiscal2022. Refer to 
Note 11  for additional inform ation on the transaction.We operate in the highly
 competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount,department, drug, dollar, v
ariety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors arenational, regional or inter
national chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies forattracting and ret
aining quality employees ("associates"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to:catastrophic events, wea
ther, global health epidemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumercredit availability, cost of 
goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economicconditions, insurance costs, in
terest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Additionally, we are monitoringthe potential impac
t of the recent coronavirus outbreak to our global business. Its financial impact is unknown at this time. Further information on the factors thatcan affect our opera
ting results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under "Item 1A. Risk Factors ," and under "
Cautionary Statement Regard ing Forward-Looking Statements." Company Performance Metrics
We are committed 
to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust ourbusiness strategies to ma
intain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  We define our financial framework as:•
strong, efficient growth;•
consistent operating discipline; and•
strategic capital allocation.As we execute on this financia
l framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.Strong, Efficient Growth
Our objective of priorit
izing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales,accelerating eComm
erce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we makestrategic investmen
ts which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.Comparable sales is a me
tric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, includingeCommerce sales, for a p
articular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retailcalendar (also known as the 4-5
-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterlyearnings releases. However, when we dis
cuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar,which may result in diffe
rences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar.Calendar comparable sa
les, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , were as follows:

nce for our customers. Sam's Club comparable sales in creased 1.6%  and 5.4%  in fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively. Sam's Club comparable sales for bo
th fiscal 2020  and 2019  benefited from growth in t ransactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket due to ourdecision to remove tobac
co from certain club locations. Sam's Club fiscal 2019  comparable sales were further aided by transfers of sales from our closed clubs toour existing clubs. Sam's Club eCommer
ce sales positively contributed approximately 1.5%  and 0.9% to comparable sal es for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively. 31

Consistent Operating DisciplineWe operate with discipl
ine by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowestcost to serve. We invest in 
technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating disciplinethrough expense leverage, which we d
efine as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.

2020 , operating, selling, gener al and administrative ("operating") expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8  basis points, when compared to theprevious fiscal year
 due to our focus on expense manage ment combined with our growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by$0.9 billion in business restruc
turing charges consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, andother business restructur
ing charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart Internationalsegments.
For fiscal 2019, operating expens
es as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of theexpense leverage were st
rong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping of certain fiscal 2018 charges. The improvements infiscal 2019 were partia
lly offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class actionlawsuit.
Strategic Capital Allocation
Our strategy includes improv
ing our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such,we are allocating mor
e capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years.Total fiscal 2020 capital e
xpenditures increased slightly compared to the prior year; the following table provides additional detail:(Amounts in millions)

 $10,705  $10,344 Returns
As we execute our financial 
framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return oninvestment and free c
ash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources
 section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most d
irectly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting principles in 
the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAPfinancial measure, 
management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deployingits assets. Trends in ROI can fluc
tuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.7%  and 3.4% for fiscal 
2020  and 2019 , respectively. The incr ease in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily due to the change in fair valueof the investment in JD.com and 
lapping the $4.5 billion net loss recorded in fiscal 2019  related to the sale of the  majority stake in Walmart Brazil, partially offsetby the dilution to operating 
income related to Flipkart. ROI was 13.4%  and 14.2%  for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively. The decr ease in ROI was due to thedecrease in operating 
income primarily as a result of the dilution from Flipkart as well as business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020. The denominatorremained relativ
ely flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting fromthe removal of the eigh
t times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases  ("ASU 2016-02") since operating lease right of use assets are now included intotal assets.
32

We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average investedcapital during that pe
riod. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciationand average amortiz
ation, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, rent for the trailing 12months multiplied by a fa
ctor of 8 is no longer included in the calculation of ROI on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized. For fiscal2020, lease related asset
s and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of the current balance sheet date,rather than averaged, b
ecause they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by afactor of 8. A two-point averag
e will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard.Further, beginning prospective
ly in fiscal 2020, rent expense in the numerator excludes short-term and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in theoperating lease right o
f use asset balance.Prior to adoption of ASU 2016-02, we defined ROI as opera
ting income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12months divided by average inves
ted capital during that period. We considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets,plus average accumulated de
preciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factorequal to the rent for the
 fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8, which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases.Because the new lease standa
rd was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of February 1, 2019, our calculation of ROI for fiscal 2019 was notrevised.
Our calculation of ROI is conside
red a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that areincluded and excluded in the 
most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from ourreported operating inco
me in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed inaccordance with genera
lly accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated netincome for the period div
ided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interestincome; and adjusts total
 assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total investedcapital. Because of the 
adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful toinvestors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard finan
cial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used bymanagement to calcu
late our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a r
econciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non
-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additionalcash from our business operat
ions, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should beconsidered in addition to, r
ather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as ameasure of our liquidity. Se
e Liquidity and Capital Resources  for discussions of GAAP metrics including n et cash provided by operating activities, net cash used ininvesting activities 
and net cash used in financing activities.We define free cash 
flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cashprovided by operating activ
ities of $25.3 billion , $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion  for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We gene rated free cash flow of $14.6 billion
, $17.4 billion and $18.3 billion  for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Net cash prov ided by operating activities for fiscal 2020  declined when compared to fiscal 
2019  primarily due to the con tribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkartoperations, and the timing o
f vendor payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020  declined when compared to f iscal 2019  due to the same reasons as the decline in netcash provided by operating ac
tivities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures. Net cash provided by operating a ctivities for fiscal 2019  declined when compared to fiscal 
2018  was primarily due to tim ing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from the Tax Act and thetiming of tax payments. Fre
e cash flow for fiscal 2019  declined when compared to f iscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided byoperating activiti
es, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures.Walmart's definit
ion of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that themeasure does not deduct the p
ayments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, webelieve it is import
ant to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Although other companies repor
t their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used bymanagement to calculate our free ca
sh flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.The following table sets for
th a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe tobe the GAAP financial measure mos
t directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash usedin financing activities.

Our total revenues, which includ
es net sales and membership and other income, increased $9.6 billion  or 1.9% and $14.1 billion  or 2.8% for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, when compar
ed to the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales, which increased $9.6 billion  or 1.9% and $14.6 billion
 or 2.9% for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , net sales were positively impacted byoverall positive compa
rable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with the addition of net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in August2018, and positive comparable s
ales in the majority of our international markets. These increases were partially offset by $4.1 billion  of negative impact from fluctuations in curren
cy exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018. For fiscal 2019 , net sales were positively impacted by ove
rall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of ourInternational mark
ets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, for fiscal 2019, the increase in net sales waspartially offset by a $4.5 b
illion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the Sam's Club segment during fiscal 2018, a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due tothe sale of the majority sta
ke in Walmart Brazil in the International segment, and $0.7 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Our gross profit rate decr
eased 40  and 18 basis points for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , these decreases were primarily due
 to price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment and the addition of Flipkart in the Walmart International segment, partially offset byfavorable merchandis
e mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to the mix 
effects from our growing eCommerce business, the acquisition of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportationexpenses.
For fiscal 
2020 , operating expenses as a per centage of net sales decreased 8  basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management 
combined with our growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in businessrestructuring charges 
consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuringcharges due to strategi
c decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments.For fiscal 2019, operating expens
es as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of theexpense leverage were st
rong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping approximately $1.8 billion in certain charges in fiscal2018. The improvements in fisc
al 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $0.2 billion charge related to asecurities class ac
tion lawsuit.Other gains and losses consisted of 
a gain of $2.0 billion  for fiscal 2020  and a loss of $8.4 billion  for fiscal 2019 . The gain in fiscal 2020 was prim arily the result ofa $1.9 billion increase in 
the market value of our investment in JD.com. The loss in fiscal 2019 is primarily the result of the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale ofthe majority stake in 
Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion decrease in the market value of our investment in JD.com. Fiscal 2018 results included loss onextinguishment of debt of $3.1 bi
llion.35

Our effective income tax rate was 24.4%  for fiscal 2020 , 37.4% for fiscal 2019 , and 30.4% for fiscal 2018 . The decrease in our eff ective tax rate for fiscal 2020 isprimarily due to the fiscal 
2019 loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which increased the comparative period's effective tax rate, as it providedminimal realizable tax benefit. The
 increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the aforementioned loss on sale of a majority stake inWalmart Brazil and Fl
ipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in ourassessment of certain 
tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix andsize of earnings among our U.S. opera
tions and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher thanthe U.S. statutory rate. The re
conciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018  is presented in Note 9  to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Sta
tements. As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, we reported $15.2 billion  and $7.2 billion  of consolidated net incom e for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, which represents an increase of 
$8.0 billion  and a decrease of $3.3 billion  for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. Diluted netincome per common share 
attributable to Walmart ("EPS") was $5.19 , $2.26 and $3.28  for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Walmart U.S. Segment

increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 2.9%  and 3.7%  for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, driven by ticket and trans
action growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.7% and 1.3% to comparable sales for fiscal 2020 and 
2019. Gross profit rate decre
ased 14  and 28 basis points for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , the decreases were primarily the r
esult of continued price investments which were partially offset by better merchandise mix, including strength in private brands, and lesspressure from transport
ation costs. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was prima rily due to our planned pricing strategy, increased transportation expenses, and the mixeffects from our growing eCom
merce business.Operating expenses as a perc
entage of segment net sales decreased 4  basis points for fiscal 2020  and decreased 23 basis points fo r fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal yea
r. We leveraged operating expenses in fiscal 2020 as a result of strong sales and productivity improvements which were mostly offset bybusiness restructuring cha
rges of $0.5 billion consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology andother business restructur
ing charges due to decisions that resulted in the write down of certain eCommerce assets. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily due tostrong sales performanc
e in conjunction with productivity improvements and the prior year comparable period including charges related to discontinued real estateprojects of $0.2 billion. These 
improvements more than offset investments in eCommerce, technology and omni-channel initiatives and raising the starting wagerate at the beginning of 
fiscal 2019.As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, segment operating income decreased $6 million  and increased $391 million for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same pe
riods in the previous fiscal year.36

iscal year. For fiscal 2020 , the decrease was prima rily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.1 billion as well as areduction in sales due to our s
ale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018, offset by a full year of net sales from Flipkart and positive comparablesales growth in the majori
ty of our markets.For fiscal 
2019 , the increase was prima rily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in thethird quarter of fisc
al 2019. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, a$0.7 billion negative impa
ct from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the continued wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reductionin net sales of $140 million du
e to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.Gross profit rate decre
ased 136  and 41 basis points for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , the decrease was primarily due to Flipkar
t, as well as a change in merchandise mix. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was d ue to Flipkart and strategic price investments in certainmarkets.
Membership and other incom
e decreased 1.1%  and 22.4% for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal2020
 was primarily due to curr ency while fiscal 2019  decreased due to the prio r year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia.Operating expenses as a perc
entage of segment net sales decreased 13  basis points for fiscal 2020  and 37 basis points for 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decr
ease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2020  was primarily due to positiv e comparable sales in the majorityof our markets and cost disc
ipline across multiple markets, partially offset by $0.4 billion in impairment charges which was due primarily to the write-off of thecarrying value of one of Flipk
art's two fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as a result of a strategic decision to focus our efforts on a single fashion platform in orderto simplify the business and cus
tomer proposition. Fiscal 2019  decreased primari ly due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately $0.5billion, which included charg
es from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations; this decrease in operatingexpenses was partially offs
et by the addition of operating expenses from Flipkart in fiscal 2019.As a result of the factors d

37

Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.0 billion  or 1.6% for fiscal 2020  and decreased $1.4 billion or 2.3%  for fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For f
iscal 2020 , the increases were pri marily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 1.6% . Comparable sales benefi ted from growth intransactions and higher fu
el sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's ClubeCommerce sales positiv
ely contributed approximately 1.5% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was prima rily due to a $4.5 billion decrease in netsales resulting from th
e net closure of 63 clubs during fiscal 2018, as well as reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations.These decreases were par
tially offset by increases in comparable sales, which were benefited by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs. Sam'sClub eCommerce sales positiv
ely contributed approximately 0.9% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019. Additional fuel sales of $0.7 billion partially offset thedecreases in net sales 
for fiscal 2019.Gross profit rate decre
ased 11  basis points for fiscal 2020  and remained relatively flat for  fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous f iscal year. The gross profitrate decreased due to 
investments in price and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales, which have lower margins. For fiscal2019
, gross profit rate was benef ited by lapping the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures in fiscal 2018 and decreased tobacco salesin fiscal 2019. This benefit 
to the gross profit rate was offset by higher transportation costs and eCommerce shipping costs, investments in price and increasedshrink in fiscal 2019.
Membership and other incom
e increased 4.7%  and 2.6% for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, when compar ed to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , the increase was primari
ly due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration along with gains onproperty sales and other in
come. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was due to an in crease of 1.5% in membership income resulting from increased Plus Memberpenetration and gains on prope
rty sales. These increases were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previous fiscal year.Operating expenses as a perc
entage of segment net sales decreased 19  and 99 basis points for fiscal 2020  and 2019 , respectively, when compar ed to the previousfiscal year. For fiscal 
2020 , the decrease was prima rily the result of lower labor-related costs and a charge of approximately $50 million related to lease exit costsin the prior comparabl
e period. These benefits were partially offset by a reduction in sales of tobacco and a higher level of technology investment. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease in opera
ting expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billion in the prior year's comparableperiod related to club 
closures and discontinued real estate projects.As a result of the factors d
iscussed above, segment operating income increased $122 million  for fiscal 2020  and increased $605 million f or fiscal  2019, when compared to the previous f
iscal year.Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability o
f our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities,supplemented with our long-te
rm debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that supportthe long-term growth of our ope
rations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock andshare repurchases. We be
lieve our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, paydividends and fund our share repur
chases for the foreseeable future.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
 
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)
 2020  2019  2018 Net cash provided by operating activities
 $25,255  $27,753  $28,337 Net cash provided by operating a
ctivities was $25.3 billion , $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion  for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Net cash prov ided byoperating activities for fiscal 
2020  decreased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipationof its future settle
ment, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments. The decrease in net cash provided by operatingactivities for fiscal 
2019 , when compared to the previous f iscal year, was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax paymentsmainly resulting from T
ax Reform and the timing of tax payments.Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Defic
itCash and cash equivalents were 
$9.5 billion  and $7.7 billion  as of January 31, 2020  and 2019 , respectively. Our working capi tal deficit, defined as total currentassets less total curr
ent liabilities, was $16.0 billion  and $15.6 billion  as of January 31, 2020  and 2019 , respectively. We gene rally operate with a working capitaldeficit due to our eff
icient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form ofpayments of cash dividends and sha
re repurchases.38

We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum costpossible. Additionally, from t
ime-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S.  Historically, U.S. taxes were due uponrepatriation of for
eign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incurother taxes such as withholding or s
tate taxes. While we are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the IRS and the U.S. Treasury department, we do notexpect current loca
l laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a materialeffect on our overall liqui
dity, financial condition or results of operations.As of 
January 31, 2020  and 2019 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion  and $2.8 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to locallaws or other restrict
ions. Of the $2.3 billion  as of January 31, 2020 , approximately $0.6 billion  can only be accessed through div idends or intercompany financingarrangements subject 
to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

tions and to expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies, remodel existing stores and club and add new storesand clubs. Net cash used in investing 
activities decreased $14.9 billion  for fiscal 2020  when compared to the previous f iscal year primarily as a result of the $13.8billion payment for the 
acquisition of Flipkart, net of cash acquired, as well as payments for other, smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2019. Net cash used in investingactivities increased 
$15.0 billion  for fiscal 2019  when compared to the previous f iscal year, primarily due to the previously mentioned fiscal 2019 acquisitions.Additionally, refer to th
e "Strategic Capital Allocation " section in our Company Performance Metri cs for capital expenditure detail  for fiscal 2020  and 2019 . Growth Activities
For the fiscal year ending J
anuary 31, 2021  ("fiscal 2021 "), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $11  billion, with a focus on store remodels andcustomer initiativ
es, eCommerce, technology, and supply chain. We also expect to add approximately 250 new stores in Walmart International, primarily inMexico and China.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
 
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)
 2020  2019  2018 Net cash used in financing activities
 $(14,299 )  $(2,537 )  $(19,875 ) Net cash used in financing ac
tivities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and therepurchase of Company stock. Trans
actions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Fiscal 2020  net cash used in financing act
ivities increased $11.8 billion  when compared to the same pe riod in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the $15.9billion of net proceeds r
eceived in the prior year from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart partially offset by $5.5billion of additional long
-term debt in the current year to fund general business operations. Fiscal 2019  net cash used in financing a ctivities decreased $17.3 billion for fiscal 
2019  when compared to the same pe riod in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received from theissuance of long-term deb
t to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes, as well as a decrease in share repurchases due tothe suspension of repurchases in 
anticipation of the Flipkart announcement.Short-term Borrowings
Net cash flows used in short-ter
m borrowings increased in fiscal 2020 and were relatively flat in fiscal 2019 . We generally utili ze the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding 
for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2020 , the additional cash used in sho
rt-term borrowings was primarily due to long-term debt issuances being used to pay down short-term borrowings.The following table includes 
additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 : 39

tions, partially offset by repayments of long-term debt.Dividends
Our total dividend payments wer
e $6.0 billion , $6.1 billion and $6.1 billion  for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Board of Dir ectors approved,effective 
February 18, 2020 , the fiscal 2021  annual dividend of $2.16  per share, an increase ov er the fiscal 2020  annual dividend of $2.12  per share. For fiscal 2021
, the annual dividend will be pa id in four  quarterly installments of $0.54  per share, according to th e following record and payable dates:Record Date

  January 4, 2021Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Comp
any repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. Allrepurchases made during
 fiscal 2020  were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase progra m approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date orother restrictions l
imiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of January 31, 2020 , authorization for $5.7 billion  of share repurchases remained und
er the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.We regularly review sha
re repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things,current cash needs, capa
city for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase p
rogram will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a s ettlement date basis, the numberof shares repurchased, ave
rage price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 :

We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due atfavorable rates in c
apital markets. As of January 31, 2020 , the ratings assigned to our co mmercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were asfollows:
Rating agency
  Commercial paper   Long-term debt Standard & Poor's
  A-1+   AA Moody's Investors Service
  P-1   Aa2 Fitch Ratings
  F1+   AA Credit rating agencies 
review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.Accordingly, we are not able to p
redict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings includechanges in our operating per
formance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt andcapitalization, and 
changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs orimpair our ability to access
 capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratingscould impair our ability t
o access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to relymore heavily on more expens
ive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper ordebt securities. Each r
ating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of anyother rating. Moreover, e
ach credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.Contractual Obligations

Finance lease obligations and other includes contractual obliga tions under other financing obligations of $1.4 billion.Under the terms of the sal
e of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil, we agreed to indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and othermatters for up to 
R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest b ased on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. As of January 31, 2020 , the indemnification liability recordedwas $0.7 billion and included in def
erred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.Additionally, we have 
$15.0 billion  of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.9 billion  of various undrawn committed lines ofcredit outside of the U.S.
 which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.Estimated interest p
ayments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2020 , and assumes interest ra tesremain at current levels for o
ur variable rate debt.Purchase obligations include 
legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capitalexpenditures, software acqu
isition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of the above table, contractual obligations forthe purchase of goods or servic
es are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed orminimum quantities to b
e purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify theCompany will purchase all or a po
rtion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, areexcluded from the tabl
e above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations topurchase rather than bind
ing agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time41

periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally containclauses allowing for canc
ellation without significant penalty.The expected timing for p
ayment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be differentdepending on the timing of re
ceipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.In addition to the amounts shown in th
e table above, $1.8 billion  of unrecognized tax benef its are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded asliabilities. The timing of t
he payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9  to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements for additionaldiscussion of unrecognized tax b
enefits.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of 
January 31, 2020 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidatedfinancial condition, r
esults of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.Other Matters

Management strives to r
eport our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex andrequire us to use technic
al terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in theU.S. These principles require us to 
make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in ourfinancial statem
ents. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.Management continually 
reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is asummary of our critic
al accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.Inventories
We value inventories a
t the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO")method for Walmart U.S. segm
ent's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. Whennecessary, we record a LIFO provision 
for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. OurLIFO provision is calculated bas
ed on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to ourretail price indi
ces would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2020  and 2019 , our inventories valued at L IFOapproximated those invento
ries as if they were valued at FIFO.Impairment of Assets
We evaluate long-lived asset
s for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.Management's judgments
 regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-livedassets is performed at 
the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on anumber of conditions, including un
certainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period.These factors could cause 
management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result inmanagement determ
ining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Impairment charges recorded in fiscal2020 were
42

immaterial. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2020 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores orclubs with indicators of imp
airment. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, whichincluded full impairment of all
 related-assets, there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019.Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets
We account for business comb
inations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired andliabilities assumed, includi
ng amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Thedetermination of fair values 
of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.For intangible assets acqui
red in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, butare not limited to, th
e amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values ofidentifiable assets 
and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.Goodwill is assigned to the report
ing unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a singlereporting unit if the com
ponents have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020 , our reporting units consisted o f Walmart U.S., WalmartInternational and Sam's Club. Goodwill 
and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually orwhenever events or c
hanges in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitativeassessment to determine 
whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, thatthe fair value of the 
reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of thecarrying amount cannot 
be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to makejudgments relating to fu
ture cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reportingunit or asset using a valuat
ion method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficientreturns to recover the 
cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have alsohistorically generated sufficient
 returns to recover their cost; however, due to certain strategic restructuring decisions in fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately$0.7 billion in impairmen
t related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if differentconditions occur in future p
eriods, future operating results could be materially impacted.Contingencies
We are involved in a numbe
r of legal proceedings. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable.We also perform an assess
ment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurredin excess of amounts accru
ed. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would bematerial, we provide dis
closure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determinewhether the likelihood of loss h
as changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able topredict the outcome or reas
onably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10  in the Notes to our Consolidated Financ ial Statements,and have not recorded
 an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a materialadverse effect on our busin
ess, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Income Taxes
Income taxes have a signi
ficant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, thedetermination of our prov
ision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.Our effective income 
tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuationallowances, changes in tax l
aw, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and internationaloperations where the statu
tory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.Our tax returns are routin
ely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions arerecorded in our financi
al statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, fromtaxing authorities. When 
facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Weaccount for uncertain 
tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in thefinancial statem
ents. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible andtaxable items.
Deferred tax assets rep
resent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporarydifferences between the fina
ncial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net43

operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portionis not more likely than not 
to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized,including recent cumulative ear
nings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. Therecoverability of th
e deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxabletemporary differences, forecasted
 operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (th
e "Tax Act") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effectivebeginning January 2018, the Tax Act redu
ced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-partypayments. As discussed in 
Note 9  to our Consolidated Financial Sta tements, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. Asfurther guidance is issued by 
the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated inaccordance with the re
levant accounting guidance.ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCL OSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket Risk
In addition to the risks inhe
rent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fairvalue of our equity investm
ent in JD.com.The analysis presented below fo
r each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does notrepresent our view of futur
e market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,however, a change in one facto
r could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in 
interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managingthe mix of fixed and vari
able rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2020 , the net fair value of ou r interest rate swaps increased  $175 millionprimarily due to fluctuation
s in market interest rates.The table below provides infor
mation about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents theprincipal cash flows and re
lated weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flowsand weighted-average int
erest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows tobe exchanged under the contr
acts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2020 .

The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives c lassified as fair value hedges.As of 
January 31, 2020 , our variable rate bor rowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 12%  of our total short-termand long-term debt. Based on 
January 31, 2020  debt levels, a 100  basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change byapproximately 
$61 million . 44

Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to fluctu
ations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well our foreign-currency-denominated 
long-term debt. For fiscal 2020 , movements in currency ex change rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of theCompany's subsidiaries in the UK and Mexico we
re the primary cause of the $0.3 billion  gain in the currency tr anslation and other category of accumulated othercomprehensive loss.
We hedge a portion of our for
eign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $241 million and asset position of 
$62 million  as of January 31, 2020  and January 31, 2019 , respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations incurrency exchange rat
es, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2020 . The hypothetical result o f a uniform 10%weakening in the value of the U.S. doll
ar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $173 million
. A hypothetical 10% change in in terest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2020  would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of 
$42 million . In addition to currency swaps, we a
lso hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivativehedges of net investments of 
certain of our foreign operations. We had outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion  as of January 31, 2020  and January 31, 2019  that was designated as a hedge of our ne
t investment in the UK. As of January 31, 2020 , a hypothetical 10% incr ease or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relativeto the British pound would have result
ed in a change in the value of the debt of $201 million . In addition, we had outstanding long- term debt of ¥180 billion  as of January 31, 2020
 and January 31, 2019  that was designated as a hedge o f our net investment in Japan. As of January 31, 2020 , a hypothetical 10% change in valueof the U.S. dollar relative 
to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $150 million . In certain countries, we
 also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated innon-functional currencies.
Investment Risk
We are exposed to changes in 
the JD.com ("JD") stock price as a result of our equity investment in JD. The change in fair value is recorded within other gains andlosses resulted in a gain of 
$1.9 billion  in fiscal 2020 due to an incr ease in the stock price of JD. As of January 31, 2020 , the fair value of our equ ity investment inJD was 
$5.4 billion . As of January 31, 2020 , a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of JD would have changed our investment in JD by approximately $550 million.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Di
rectors of Walmart Inc.Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the ac
companying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidatedstatements of income, 
comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2020, and the relatednotes (collectively 
referred to as the "Consolidated Financial Statements"). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all materialrespects, the financi
al position of the Company at January 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in theperiod ended January 31, 2020, in confor
mity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internalcontrol over financia
l reporting as of January 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Tre
adway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Adoption of ASU No. 2016-02
As
 discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases effective February 1, 2019, due to theadoption of Accounting Standards Update 
(“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases  (Topic 842). Basis for Opinion
These financial stat
ements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a pub
lic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securit
ies laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of mater
ial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included exam
ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles u
sed and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a r
easonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicate
d below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe communicated to the au
dit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especiallychallenging, subjective o
r complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated FinancialStatements, taken as a whole, 
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on theaccounts or disclosures to which 
they relate. 
 ContingenciesDescription of the
Matter
 
As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2020, the Company is involved in a number of legalproceedings and has made ac
cruals with respect to certain of these matters. For other matters, a liability is not probable, or the amountcannot be reasonably esti
mated and therefore an accrual has not been made. Where a liability is reasonably possible and may bematerial, such matters have bee
n disclosed. Management assessed the probability of occurrence and the estimation of any potentialloss based on the ability to pr
edict the number of claims that may be filed or whether any loss or range of loss can be reasonablyestimated. For example, i
n assessing the probability of occurrence in a particular legal proceeding, management exercises judgment todetermine if it c
an predict the number of claims that may be filed and whether it can reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss thatmay arise from that p
roceeding.47

  Auditing management’s accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved ourassessment of the signifi
cant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence or when determiningwhether an estimate of 
the loss or range of loss could be made.How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
Audit
 
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification andevaluation of contingenc
ies. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s assessment of the likelihood of loss and theCompany’s determinations r
egarding the measurement of loss.To test the Company’s assessment o
f the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, amongother procedures, we read th
e minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board of directors, reviewedopinions provided to the Company by cer
tain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and externalcounsel, and evaluated the 
current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel. We also evaluated theappropriateness of the r
elated disclosures. 
 Valuation of Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsDescription of the
Matter
 
At January 31, 2020, the Company has $5.2 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets. As disclosed in Notes 1, 8 and 12 to theConsolidated Fina
ncial Statements, these assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually using valuation techniques to estimatefair value. These fair value
 estimates are sensitive to certain significant assumptions including revenue growth rates, discount rates,and royalty rates.
Auditing management’s annua
l indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests was complex and highly judgmental due to thesignificant measurement uncertaint
y in determining the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangibles. For example, the fair valueestimates are sensitive to si
gnificant assumptions identified above that are affected by future market or economic conditions.How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
Audit
 
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset 
impairment review process. Our procedures included testing controls over management’s review of thesignificant assumptions des
cribed above used to estimate the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets.To test the estimated 
fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others,assessing methodologies used to de
termine the fair value, testing the significant assumptions discussed above and testing thecompleteness and accur
acy of the underlying data used by the Company. For example, we evaluated management’s forecasted revenuegrowth rates used in the fai
r value estimates by comparing those assumptions to the historical results of the Company and currentindustry, market and econom
ic forecasts. We involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the valuation methodologies andthe significant assumpt
ions such as discount rates and royalty rates. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analyses of significantassumptions to evaluate
 the effect on the fair value estimates of the indefinite-lived intangible assets./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Di
rectors of Walmart Inc.Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Walmart Inc.'
s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control-IntegratedFramework issued by the Committe
e of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, WalmartInc. (the Company) mai
ntained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the accompanyingconsolidated balance sheet
s of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2020  and 2019 , the related consolida ted statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders'equity and cash flows for each o
f the three years in the period ended January 31, 2020 , and the related notes and ou r report dated March 20, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financia
l reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion onthe Company’s internal cont
rol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to beindependent with respect to 
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities andExchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether effective inter
nal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe design and operating ef
fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We be
lieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financia
l ReportingA company’s internal contro
l over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statement
s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes tho
se policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Walmart Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Walmart Inc. ("Wa
lmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity toshop in retail stores and th
rough eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striv ing to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlesslyintegrates eCommerc
e and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. Each week, the Company serves over 265 million  customers who visit approximately 
11,500  stores and numerous eCommerc e websites under 56  banners in 27  countries.The Company's operations comprise 
three  reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020  ("fiscal 2020 "), January 31, 2019
 ("fiscal 2019 ") and January 31, 2018  ("fiscal 2018 "). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. TheCompany consolidates variabl
e interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investmentsfor which the Company exercises s
ignificant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities andequity method investments 
are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company's Consolidated Financial Sta
tements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. TheCompany consolidates all othe
r operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during themonth of January 
2020  related to the opera tions consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Stat
ements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require managementto make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure ofcontingent assets and liab
ilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual resultsmay differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The
 Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronictransfer transact
ions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified ascash and cash equivalents to
taled $1.7 billion  and $1.4 billion  as of January 31, 2020  and 2019 , respectively. The Company's cash balances are h
eld in various locations around the world. Most of the Company's $9.5 billion  and $7.7 billion  of cash and cash equivalents as ofJanuary 31, 
2020  and January 31, 2019  were held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equ ivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidityneeds in the Company's non-U.S. operations.
The Company uses intercompany fin
ancing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimumcost possible.
As of 
January 31, 2020  and 2019 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.3 billion  and $2.8 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S.due to local laws or other r
estrictions. Of the $2.3 billion  as of January 31, 2020 , approximately $0.6 billion  can only be accessed through div idends orintercompany financing 
arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart") minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to beutilized to fund the oper
ations of Flipkart.Receivables
Receivables are stat
ed at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includesinsurance companies resu
lting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days toprocess; suppliers for ma
rketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. As of January 31, 2020  and January 31, 2019 , receivables from transactions 
with customers, net were $2.9 billion  and $2.5 billion , respectively. 55

InventoriesThe Company values inventories a
t the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out("LIFO") method for the Walm
art U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventorymethod of accounting, using the 
first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of costor market, since perm
anent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valuedusing the weighted-average 
cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2020  and January 31, 2019 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated thoseinventories as if they wer
e valued at FIFO.Assets Held for Sale
Assets held for sale repres
ent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset andliability amounts in th
e Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fairvalue, less costs to sell.  The Comp
any reviews all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts arefully recoverable in 
comparison to estimated fair values.  As of January 31, 2020  and January 31, 2019 , immaterial amoun ts for assets and liabilities held for salewere classified in prep
aid expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are 
initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements arecapitalized, while cos
ts of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipmentbalances and includes the 
estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: 
   As of January 31, (Amounts in millions)
 Estimated Useful Lives  2020  2019 Land
 N/A  $24,619  $24,526 Buildings and improvements
 3-40 years  105,674  101,006 Fixtures and equipment

   (89,820 )  (81,493 ) Property and equipment, net
   $105,208  $104,317 Leasehold improvements are
 depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Totaldepreciation and amor
tization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and financing obligations, property under capital leases andintangible assets for fiscal 
2020 , 2019 and 2018  was $11.0 billion , $10.7 billion and $10.5 billion , respectively. Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease asse ts and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet.  TheCompany adopted this ASU and related am
endments as of February 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach and elected certain practical expedientspermitted under the transitio
n guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts todetermine if they con
tain leases.  For leases subject to index or rate adjustments, the most current index or rate adjustments were included in the measurement ofoperating lease obliga
tions at adoption.The adoption of this ASU and related a
mendments resulted in a $14.8 billion  increase to total ass ets and a $15.1 billion  increase to total liabilities in  the firstquarter of fiscal 2020. In 
the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $16.8 billion  and $17.5 billion  of operating lease righ t-of-use assets andoperating lease obliga
tions, respectively, and removed $2.2 billion  and $1.7 billion , respectively, of asset s and liabilities related to financial obligations connectedwith the construction of le
ased stores. Several other asset and liability line items in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet were also impacted by immaterialamounts. Additionally, the adopt
ion resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $0.3 billion , net of tax, which primari lyconsisted of the recognit
ion of impairment. The Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows were immateriallyimpacted. Accounting polic
ies as a result of the adoption of this ASU are described below.  Refer to Note 7  for additional lease d isclosures.For any new or modified lease, th
e Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease obligat
ions for its finance and operating leases, which are56

initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easilydeterminable, the Company
’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments.Lease term is defined 
as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company willexercise the option. The Company h
as elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initialterm of 12 months or less.
For a majority of all c
lasses of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been 
combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Management reviews long-l
ived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not berecoverable. The evalu
ation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flowsexpected to be generat
ed by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carryingamount of the assets may not b
e recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by anappropriate market appraisal or
 other valuation technique.Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess o
f the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reportingunit when acquired. Other acqui
red intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intendeduse of the related asse
t. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever eventsor changes in circumstance
s indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortizedon a straight-line basis ov
er the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.Goodwill is assigned to the report
ing unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a singlereporting unit if the com
ponents have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020 , the Company's reporting units consis ted of Walmart U.S., WalmartInternational and Sam's Club. Goodwill 
is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units.Generally, a qualitative as
sessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, afterperforming an assessment b
ased on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fairvalue of the reporting uni
t substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. Thequantitative test fo
r goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discountedcash flow method an
d relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater thanthe carrying amount and, a
ccordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.The following table refl
ects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2020  and 2019 : (Amounts in millions)

 Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2019 for Walmart International relates to Flipkart.Intangible assets are 
included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $5.2 billion
 and $5.8 billion , respectively, in indef inite-lived intangible assets which is primarily made up of acquired trade names. Refer to Note 12  for additional information relat
ed to acquired intangible assets for the Flipkart acquisition. During fiscal 2020 , the Company incurred approxim ately $0.7 billion  in impairment charges related to its intan
gible assets. There were no  significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2019  and 2018 . Refer to Note 8  for additional information.

Fair Value MeasurementIn January 2016, the Financial Accoun
ting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-01, Financial Instruments– Overall (Topic 825)
, which updated certain aspe cts of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments ("ASU 2016-01"). TheCompany adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which primar
ily impacted the Company's accounting for its investment in JD.com, Inc. ("JD") and resulted in apositive adjustment to r
etained earnings of approximately $2.6 billion , net of tax, in fiscal 2019 bas ed on the market value of the Company's investment in JD as ofJanuary 31, 2018. The adoption required p
rospective changes in fair value of the Company's investment in JD to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement ofIncome, which the Company classi
fies in other gains and losses.The Company records and discloses c
ertain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the assetcould be sold in an orderly tr
ansaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is theamount that would be paid to tr
ansfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liabilitywith the creditor. Refer 
to Note 8  for more information. Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a numbe
r of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, genera l liability, auto liability, product liability and certainemployee-related healthcare benefits
. Standard actuarial proce dures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balancesheet date on an un
discounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-outexpenses related to the p
rocessing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reservevaluations. To limit exposur
e to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coveragefor workers' compensation, gene
ral liability and auto liability.Derivatives
The Company uses derivatives for h
edging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain anappropriate mix of fix
ed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. TheCompany may be exposed to credit
-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Credit risk is monitored through establishedapproval procedures, includ
ing setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty. The Companyenters into derivativ
es with counterparties rated only "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The Company is subject to master nettingarrangements which provides s
et-off and close out netting of exposures with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in itsConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Company
’s collateral arrangements requires the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds,after considering the effects 
of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received under these arrangements was not significant as of January31, 2020 and 2019. The Company was not required to provid
e any cash collateral to counterparties as of January 31, 2020 and 2019.In order to qualify for hedg
e accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategyfor undertaking the hedging t
ransaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of thehedge, derivative gains
 and losses are recorded through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensiveloss until the hedged item 
is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has notelected hedge account
ing, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in theCompany's Consolidated Balance Sheets as 
either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded aseither current or non-current
 liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 8  for the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities.Fair Value Hedges
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. All interest rateswaps designated as fair valu
e hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fairvalues of these interes
t rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. These derivatives will mature on datesranging from 
October 2020  to April 2024. Cash Flow Hedges
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecastedpayments of principal and 
interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated othercomprehensive loss which is subsequen
tly58

reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2022  to March 2034
. Net Investment Hedges
The Company is a party to rece
ive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investmentsof certain of its for
eign operations. The Company records changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Thesederivatives will matu
re on dates ranging from July 2020  to February 2030. The Company also designated cer tain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as ahedge of currency exposure asso
ciated with the net investment of these operations. The Company records foreign currency gain or loss associated with designatedlong-term debt in accu
mulated other comprehensive loss. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $3.9 billion , respectively, of outstand ing long-termdebt designated as net inves
tment hedges.These derivative and non-de
rivative gains or losses continue to defer in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the sale or substantial liquidation of theseforeign operations.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted f
or under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequencesattributable to differences bet
ween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporarydifferences"). Deferred tax a
ssets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to berecovered or settled. The
 effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.Deferred tax assets ar
e evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.Many factors are conside
red when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,expectations of future taxa
ble income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets isevaluated by assessin
g the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operatingearnings and available 
tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains a provision whi
ch subjects a U.S. parent of a foreign subsidiary to current U.S. tax on its global intangible low–taxed income(“GILTI”). The GILTI income is 
eligible for a deduction, which lowers the effective tax rate to 10.5%  for calendar years 2018 th rough 2025 and 13.125%  after 2025. The Company will report the tax 
impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basisdifferences expect
ed to reverse as GILTI.In determining the provis
ion for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and taxincome, and statutory inco
me tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.The Company records a liabil
ity for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Companyrecords interest and pen
alties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, inthe Company's Consolidated Statemen
ts of Income. Refer to Note 9  for additional income tax disclosures.Revenue Recognition
    Net Sales
The Company recognizes sales r
evenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer. eCommerce salesinclude shipping revenue and a
re recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membe
rship fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membershipfee revenue was 
$1.5 billion  for fiscal 2020 and $1.4 billion  for each of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership andother income in the Company's Consolid
ated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company'sConsolidated Balance Sheets.
Gift Cards
Customer purchases of gift c
ards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards inthe U.S. and some countries do not car
ry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members59

can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. Whilegift cards are gener
ally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Managementestimates unredeem
ed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Incomeover the expected rede
mption period.Financial and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue 
from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component ofnet sales in the Company's Consolidat
ed Statements of Income.Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actua
l product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost oftransportation from th
e Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and importdistribution centers. Cost of s
ales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consider
ation from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specificprograms such as markdowns, margin p
rotection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost ofsales, except in cert
ain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company'sConsolidated Statements of In
come when the related inventory is sold.Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, genera
l and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, themajority of the cost of wa
rehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating,selling, general and adm
inistrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments'distribution facili
ties in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may includeall costs related to their di
stribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed 
as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general andadministrative expens
es in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific,incremental and identifiable adverti
sing costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.Advertising costs were 
$3.7 billion , $3.5 billion and $3.1 billion  for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities
 of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balancesheet date. Related tr
anslation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements ofIncome of all intern
ational subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered bythe income statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Instruments
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measur ement of expected credit losses ofcertain financia
l instruments. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2020 with no material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per com
mon share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted netincome per common share 
attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutiveeffect of share-bas
ed awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation ofdiluted net income per comm
on share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 . 60

centive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan"), as amended and restated effective February 23, 2016, as amended further as of February 1, 2017, andas renamed on February 1, 2018, was estab
lished to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensationawards for which 
260 million  shares of Walmart co mmon stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, asamended. The Company believes th
at such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.The Plan's award types are summa
rized as follows:•
Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards ar e for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions relatedto employment. Performance
 share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0%  to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting p
eriods for these awards are generally between one and three years . Restricted stock and perfo rmance share units may besettled or deferred 
in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards isdetermined on the date o
f grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units is determined on the date of grantusing the Company's stock price discoun
ted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. Theweighted-average discount 
for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share units in fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018  was 5.1% , 6.2%and 
7.2%, respectively. •
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provid e rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2020, restricted stockunits generally vest at 
a rate of 25%  each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50%  of restricted stock units generallyvested 
three years  from the grant date and the remaining 50%  were vested five years  from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit isdetermined on the date o
f grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably overthe vesting period. The expec
ted dividend yield is based on the anticipated61

dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted infiscal 
2020 , 2019 and 2018  was 4.9% , 7.2% and 9.0% , respectively. In addition to the Plan, the Company's Uni
ted Kingdom subsidiary has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years . The stock option share-based compensa
tion expense is included in the Other line in the table above.Flipkart also maintains 
a stock option plan primarily for the benefit of employees and nonemployee directors under which options to acquire Flipkart commonshares may be issued. The grants h
ave no  exercise price and no  compensation expense was recognized during fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019 where a performancecondition was not deemed probabl

Assets and liabilities r
ecorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of thefair value hierarchy are:
•
Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and•
Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.The Company measures the fai
r value of equity investments (primarily its investment in JD) on a recurring basis and records them in other long-term assets in theaccompanying Consolidated Balan
ce Sheets. Measurement details about the Company's two portions of the investment in JD are as follows:•
The purchased portion of the investment in JD is measured using Level 1 inputs.•
The portion of the investment in JD received in exchange for selling certain assets related to Yihaodian, the Company's former eCommerce operation inChina, measured using Level 2 inputs. Fa
ir value is determined primarily using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets.The fair value of the Company's

DerivativesThe Company also has derivatives 
recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination ofthe related deriva
tive agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include therelevant interest 
rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2020  and January 31, 2019 , the notional amounts and fa ir values of these derivativeswere as follows:

abilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair valuemeasurements. General
ly, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.For the fiscal year ended 
January 31, 2020 , the Company recorded impai rment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis primarilyrelated to the following:
•
in the Walmart U.S. segment, $0.5 billion  in impairment charg es for impaired assets consisting primarily of trade names and acquired developed softwaredue to strategic decis
ions that resulted in the write-down of certain eCommerce assets; and•
in the Walmart International segment, $0.4 billion  in impairment charg es consisting primarily of the write-off of the carrying value of one of Flipkart'stwo fashion trade names, Jabong.co
m, as a result of a strategic decision to focus on the Myntra.com fashion platform.These impairment cha
rges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Otherimpairment charges 
for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2020  were immaterial. As discussed in 
Note 12 , the Company sold the majority s take in Walmart Brazil during fiscal 2019. The assets of the disposal group totaled $3.3 billion  and were comprised of 
$1.0 billion  in current assets, $1.6 billion  in property and equipment and p roperty under capital lease and financing obligations, net, and $0.7 billion of other long-term asse
ts. When measured as held for sale, these assets were fully impaired as the carrying value of the disposal group exceeded the fair value, lesscosts to sell and contribut
ed to a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion  in the Walmart Int ernational segment, which was recorded in other gains and losses in theCompany's Consolidated Statement of 
Income. Other impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2019 wereimmaterial.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equ
ivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fairvalue due to their short-
term maturities.The Company's long-term debt is a
lso recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing ratefor similar types of bor
rowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2020  and 2019 , are as follows:

 $4,915  $4,281  $4,600 In December 2017, the Tax Act was ena
cted and significantly changed U.S. income tax law. Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory taxrate and created new t
axes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new taxon global intangible low-tax
ed income ("GILTI"). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreignsubsidiary earnings not previous
ly subject to U.S. income tax.The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bull
etin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("SAB 118"), which allowed companies to record provis
ional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactmentand the complexity involved 
in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts inits financial stat
ements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance tocertain income tax 
effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.  Managementcompleted the Company's accoun
ting for Tax Reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additionalguidance issued by the IRS could impa
ct the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was$207 million
, and in fiscal 2019, the Company re corded $442 million  of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision forincome taxes.
One-time Transition Tax
The Tax Act required the Company to p
ay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of15.5%
 to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0%  on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, theCompany recorded a provisional 
amount of $1.9 billion  of additional income tax  expense for its one-time transitional tax liability. The Company calculated theTransition Tax liabili
ty and increased the provisional amount by $413 million , with the increase includ ed as a component of provision for income taxes in fiscal2019.
Deferred Tax Effects
The Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory 
tax rate from 35.0%  to 21.0%, beginning January 2018. Accordingly, the Comp any re-measured its deferred taxes as ofJanuary 31, 2018, to reflect th
e reduced rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized. In fiscal 2018, the Companyrecognized a deferr
ed tax benefit of $2.1 billion  to reflect the redu ced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act. In fiscal 2018, the Company made noprovisional adjustment with 
respect to the GILTI provision of the Tax Act. Upon finalizing the provisional accounting for the remeasurement of U.S. deferred taxassets and liabiliti
es in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded an additional tax benefit of $75 million , which is included as a component o f provision for income taxes.69

Effective Income Tax Rate ReconciliationIn the past, the Company's effe
ctive income tax rate was typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed globaloperations partially o
ffset by a valuation allowance. However, beginning January 2018, the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0%  generally falls below st atutory rates ininternational jurisdictions.
 A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax incomefrom continuing operations 
is as follows:

Unremitted EarningsPrior to the Tax Act, the Company asse
rted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TaxAct, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on 
the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally befree of U.S. federal tax, but 
may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.  As of January 31, 2020, the Company has not recorded approximately $3 billion of deferred t
ax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income andwithholding taxes would be due upon repat
riation.Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
As of 
January 31, 2020 , the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $37.8 billion . Of these carryforwards, approximately 
$25.2 billion  will expire, if not util ized, in various years through 2040 . The remaining carryfo rwards have no expiration.The recoverability of 
these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, includingtaxable income in prior carry
back years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To theextent the Company does not conside
r it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To theextent that a valuat
ion allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, thechange in the valuation a
llowance is recognized in the consolidated statements of income.The Company had valuation allowanc
es of $8.6 billion  and $2.4 billion  as of January 31, 2020  and 2019 , respectively, on defer red tax assets associated primarilywith net operating loss car
ryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to taxlaw changes in Luxembourg enact
ed in December 2019 the Company recognized additional deferred tax assets, and related valuation allowances, of $6.2 billion associated with existing ne
t operating loss carryforwards. Other activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2020 related to valuation allowance increases inother markets, as well as 
releases due to the expiration of underlying deferred tax assets.Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncerta
in tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probabilitythat the uncertain t
ax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.As of 
January 31, 2020  and 2019 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $1.8 billion  and $1.3 billion , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax b
enefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $1.6 billion  and $1.1 billion  as of January 31, 2020  and 2019 , respectively.
A reconciliation of unre
cognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: 
 Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)
 2020  2019  2018 Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year
 $1,305  $1,010  $1,050 Increases related to prior year tax positions
 516  620  130 Decreases related to prior year tax positions
 (15 ) (107 ) (254 )Increases related to current year tax positions
 66  203  122 Settlements during the period
 (29 ) (390 ) (23 )Lapse in statutes of limitations
 (26 ) (31 ) (15 )Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year
 $1,817  $1,305  $1,010 The Company classifies inte
rest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses,respectively. Interest expen
se and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 . During the next twelve months, it isreasonably possible that t
ax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained onaudit or because the Company ag
rees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible. As a result of theseefforts, unrecognized t
ax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months. The Company does not expect anychange to have a mater
ial impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company remains subject to 
income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2014 , and 2017 through 2020 . The Company also remains subject to income ta
x examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013  through 2020 , and for U.S. state and local inco me taxes generally for thefiscal years ended 
2013  through 2020 . With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by taxauthorities for years b
efore fiscal 2012.71

Other TaxesThe Company is subject to tax exa
minations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing invarious jurisdictions. In c
ertain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unlessotherwise indicated, the poss
ible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, ifdecided adversely to the Comp
any, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.Note 10. Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of 
legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflectedin the Company's Consolidated Financia
l Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore anaccrual has not been mad
e. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter intodiscussions regarding settl
ement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and itsshareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the m
atters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liabilitymaterial to the Company's 
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Asda Equal Value Claims
Asda Stores, Ltd. ("Asda"), a wholly-owned subsidiary o
f the Company, is a defendant in over 35,000  "equal value" claims th at began in 2008 and are proceedingbefore an Employment Tribun
al in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former Asda storeemployees, and further c
laims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value interms of, among other things, 
the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that thedifference in pay betwe
en these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses anddistribution facili
ties, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in thewarehouse and distribution fa
cilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.In October 2016, following a preli
minary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those ofemployees in Asda's warehouse and dist
ribution facilities. Asda appealed the ruling and the appeal is scheduled to be heard by the Supreme Court of the UnitedKingdom on July 14-15, 2020.
Notwithstanding the appeal, cl
aimants are now proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by theclaimants is of equal v
alue to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities.At present, the Company cannot pred
ict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise fromthese proceedings. Accordingly, 
the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business,financial position, resu
lts of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defensesto these claims, and int
ends to defend the claims vigorously.National Prescription Opiate Litigat
ion and Related MattersIn December 2017, the United Stat
es Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by variousplaintiffs, including coun
ties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning theimpacts of widespread opioid 
abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Lit igation (MDL No. 2804), and is pending in the U.S. District Court for th
e Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrictlitigation. Similar 
cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs.Plaintiffs are seeking 
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement.  The Company cannot predict the number of suchclaims that may be f
iled, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company hasalso been responding to subpoenas, info
rmation requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing anddistribution practic
es involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, theCompany can provide no assurance as 
to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results ofoperations or cash flows will not b
e materially adversely affected.72

FCPA Investigation and Related MattersAs previously disclosed, the Company was under 
investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"SEC") regarding possible violations o
f the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"). Throughout the investigative process, the Company cooperated withthe DOJ and the SEC, and on June 20, 2019, the Company announced the r
esolution of the investigations with the DOJ and the SEC and paid $283 million  in June 2019 consisting of a combination o
f penalties, disgorgement and interest as further described below (the "Settlement Amount"). The Company previously recordedthe Settlement Amount i
n the Company's fiscal 2018 consolidated financial statements in anticipated settlement of these matters.The resolution of the invest
igations with the DOJ and SEC included:1.
A non-prosecution agreement (the "NPA") between the DOJ and the Company for a three-year term. Pursuant to the NPA, the Company paid a $138 million
 penalty and agreed to ma intain the Company's anti-corruption compliance program for three years, certain reporting obligations for three years,and a limited monitorsh
ip with a third-party for two years regarding the Company's anti-corruption compliance program, with the possibility of a thirdyear pending the results of 
the monitorship during the initial two-year period. The DOJ agreed that it will not prosecute the Company for any conductdescribed in the NPA provided that th
e Company performs its obligations under the NPA for the three-year term.2.
A plea agreement (the "Plea Agreement") entered into for a three-year term by the DOJ and WMT Brasilia S.a.r.l., an indirect wholly-owned foreignsubsidiary of the Company ("WMT Brasi
lia") that previously owned a majority stake of the Company's Brazilian business. Through the Plea Agreement,entered in the United Stat
es District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, WMT Brasilia pled guilty to one count of causing a books and recordsviolation of the FCPA. The Company on behalf of WMT Br
asilia was assessed a $4 million  penalty, including forfe iture, that was deducted from theamount paid by the Company under the NPA.
3.
A Cease-and-Desist Order entered into by the SEC in a civil administrative proceeding (the "SEC Order"), the entry of which the Company consented towith respect to certa
in violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The Company paid $145 million  in disgorgement and interest, and agreed 
to make certain reports to the SEC on its anti-corruption compliance and remediation efforts for two years, and cease and desistany violations of the books and re
cords and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.On June 20, 2019, the Company also entered into 
an Administrative Agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") for a three-year term,which replaces the inte
rim administrative agreement between the Company and the EPA dated May 28, 2013. The May 28, 2013 agreement arose as part of asettlement by the Company r
egarding certain hazardous waste materials matters with several governmental authorities. The new EPA agreement, among otherthings, resolved any debarmen
t or suspension as to participation in federal government programs by the Company due to the NPA, the Plea Agreement, and theSEC Order, provided that the Company fulf
ills the terms and conditions of the new EPA agreement, which requires reporting by the Company to the EPAperiodically during the 
three-year term, and requires a new, limited two-year monitorship. The monitor referenced above that has been engaged by the Companyunder the NPA will also monitor compl
iance with the new EPA agreement. If the DOJ monitorship is extended as referenced above, the EPA monitorship may alsobe extended for an addition
al year.In addition, the Company expects 
to incur costs in implementing the settlement and may incur costs in responding to any new civil or regulatory actions. TheCompany does not presently believ
e that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Note 11. Retirement-Related Benefi
tsThe Company offers a 401(k) plan fo
r associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. TheCompany also offers a 401(k) type p
lan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Underthese plans, after one ye
ar of employment, the Company matches 100%  of participant contr ibutions up to 6%  of annual eligible earnings. The matchingcontributions immedia
tely vest at 100%  for each associate. Par ticipants can contribute up to 50%  of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits.Associates in internation
al countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans areadministered based upon the 
legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established.73

The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 :

 $1,361  $1,291  $1,250 Additionally, the Company's subsidiar
ies in the United Kingdom and Japan have sponsored defined benefit pension plans. In October 2019, Asda, Walmart and theTrustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (
the "Plan") entered into an agreement pursuant to which Asda made a cash contribution of $1.0 billion  to the Plan (the "Asda Pension Contribution") which enabled th
e Plan to purchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants. The agreement betweenAsda, Walmart and the Trust
ee of the Plan contemplates that subsequent to the purchase of the bulk annuity insurance contract by the Plan, each of the Planparticipants will be issu
ed an individual annuity contract. The issuer of the individual annuity insurance contracts will be solely responsible for paying eachparticipant’s benef
its in full and will release the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. The Company expects the issuance of individual annuity contracts tothe Plan participants to 
take place in late fiscal 2021 or early fiscal 2022, which will trigger a pension settlement that will result in all Plan balances, includingaccumulated pension compon
ents within other comprehensive income, being charged to expense.The defined benefit pension p
lan in Japan was underfunded by $140 million  and $175 million  as of January 31, 2020  and 2019 , respectively and reco rded as aliability in the Company's Consolid
ated Balance Sheets in deferred income taxes and other. Certain other international operations also have defined benefitarrangements that a
re not significant.Note 12. Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items
The following material di
sposals, acquisitions and other items impact the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have alsooccurred or been announced.
Walmart Brazil
In August 2018, the Company sold an 
80 percent  stake of Walmart Bra zil to Advent International ("Advent"). Under the terms of the sale, Advent agreed tocontribute additional capital t
o the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters.As a result, the Company recorded 
a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion  during fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement ofIncome
. Substantially all of this charge was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 upon meeting the held for sale criteria. In calculating the loss, the fairvalue of the disposal group was redu
ced by $0.8 billion  related to an indemni ty, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferredincome taxes and other in 
the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax andlegal contingencies and o
ther matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest b ased on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate.The Company deconsolidated the f
inancial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest using the equ
ity method of accounting. This equity method investment was determined to have no  fair value and continues to have no  carryingvalue.
Flipkart
In August 2018, the Company acquired 
81 percent  of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent  of the diluted shares, of Flipk art, an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace
, for cash consideration of approximately $16 billion . The acquisition increas es the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. In thesecond quarter of fisca
l 2020, the Company finalized the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Flipkart acquisition as follows:•
Assets of $24.1 billion , which comprise primari ly of $2.2 billion  in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion  in other current assets, $5.0 billion  in intangible assets and 
$13.5 billion  in goodwill. Of the intangible ass ets, $4.7 billion  represents the fair v alue of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which wereestimated using the inco
me approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $0.3 billion  of intangible assets primarily relate to acquiredtechnology with a life of 
3 years . The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarilyrelated to procurem
ent and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes;•
Liabilities of $3.7 billion , which comprise primari ly of $1.8 billion  of current liabilities and $1.7 billion  of deferred income t axes; and74

•Noncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion , for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The Company began consolidating the 
financial statements of Flipkart in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, using a one-month lag. To finance the acquisition, theCompany used a combination of cash p
rovided by long-term debt as discussed in Note 6  and cash on hand. The Flipkart resul ts of operations since acquisition andthe pro forma financial informati
on are immaterial.Note 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the opera
tion of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina,Canada, Central America, Chil
e, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company previously operated in Brazil prior to the sale of the majoritystake of Walmart Bra
zil in fiscal 2019 discussed in Note 12 . The Company's operations are conduc ted in three  reportable segments: Walmart U.S., WalmartInternational and Sam's Club. The Comp
any defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularlyreviews to analyze perfo

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosur
e controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, isaccumulated and commun
icated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls andprocedures, no matter how well d
esigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management isnecessarily required 
to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control ormanage those entities, ou
r controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to ourconsolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of busin
ess, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controlsand increase effic
iency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, moreefficient systems, upda
ting existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared servicesorganizations and incre
asing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company'sinternal control over 
financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internalcontrol environment re
mains effective.An evaluation of the effe
ctiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report wasperformed under the superv
ision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon thatevaluation, our Chief Execut
ive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonableassurance that inform
ation required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, isaccumulated and commun
icated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisionsregarding required disc
losure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within thetime periods specifi
ed by the SEC's rules and forms.Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

sibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is aprocess designed to
 provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reportingpurposes in accordance with a
ccounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financialreporting may not prevent o
r detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as ofJanuary 31, 2020
. In making its assessment, m anagement has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of theTreadway Commission in Interna
l Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control overfinancial reporting was 
effective as of January 31, 2020 . The Company's internal control ov er financial reporting as of January 31, 2020 , has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their r
eport which appears herein.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Common Stock
Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Shares; No Liability for Corporate Obligations
All
 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable. A share of Common Stock is fully paid and non-assessable
 if such share has been issued for consideration legally permissible under the DGCL with a value at least equal to the parvalue
 per share of Common Stock. Holders of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock will not be liable for anyobligations or liabilities of the Company that the Company may fail to discharge.

 any  amendments  to  our  Certificate,  any  merger  or  consolidation  to  which  we  are  a  party  (other  than  parent-subsidiarymergers),
 any sale of all or substantially all of our assets or our dissolution as a corporation. In addition, the DGCL requires theholders
 of a majority of the outstanding shares of our stock to approve any conversion of our corporation to another type of entity,such as a limited liability company. Our shareholders do not have cumulative voting rights as to the election of directors.

DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIESThe
 following description of the Notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete. This description is qualified in its entiretyby reference to the Indenture, dated as
 of July 19, 2005, as supplemented, between the Company and The Bank of New York MellonTrust Company, N.A. (“
BNYM ”), as trustee (the “ Indenture ”). The Notes
The
 Notes were issued under the Indenture, which provides that debt securities may be issued under the Indenture from time to timein
 one or more series. The Indenture and the Notes are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of NewYork.
 The  Indenture  does  not  limit  the  amount  of  debt  securities  that  we  may  issue  under  the  Indenture.  We  may,  without  theconsent
 of the holders of the debt securities of any series, issue additional debt securities ranking equally with, and otherwise similarin
 all respects to, the debt securities of the series (except for the public offering price and the issue date) so that those additional debtsecurities will be consolidated and form a single series with the debt securities of the series previously offered and sold.
The 2022 Notes
We
 issued €850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes on April 8, 2014. The maturity date of the 2022 Notes isApril
 8, 2022, and interest at a rate of 1.900% per annum is paid annually on April 8 of each year and on the maturity date. Asof January 31, 2020, €850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes was outstanding.
The 2026 Notes
We
 issued €650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes on April 8, 2014. The maturity date of the 2026 Notes isApril
 8, 2026, and interest at a rate of 2.550% per annum is paid annually on April 8 of each year and on the maturity date. Asof January 31, 2020, €650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes was outstanding.
Ranking
The
 Notes  are  our  senior  unsecured  debt  obligations  and  rank  equally  among  themselves  and  with  all  of  our  existing  and  futureunsecured
 and unsubordinated debt obligations. Consequently, the holders of the Notes have a right to payment equal to that of ourother
 unsecured  creditors.  None  of  our  subsidiaries  have  any  obligation  as  to  any  of  the  Notes  or  will  guarantee  the  payment  ofamounts owing with respect to any of the Notes. The Indenture does not restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness.
Payment on the Notes
All
 payments of principal of, including payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, and accrued interest on, and the paymentof
 any additional amounts payable with respect to, the Notes will be payable in euro; provided, however, if the euro is unavailable tous due
 to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by thethen
 member  states  of  the  European  Monetary  Union  that  have  adopted  the  euro  as  their  currency  or  for  the  settlement  oftransactions by public institutions of or within the
 international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will bemade in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. The amount payable on any date in euro will be converted
4

into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System as of the close of business onthe
 second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal ReserveSystem
 has not mandated a rate of conversion on such date, on the basis of the most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate publishedin 
The Wall Street Journal on  or most recently prior to the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date. Any payment inrespect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under such Notes or the Indenture.
“Business
 Day”  means  any  day,  other  than  a  Saturday  or  a  Sunday,  (1)  which  is  not  a  day  on  which  banking  institutions  areauthorized
 or  obligated  by  law  or  executive  order  to  close  in  New  York  City  or  London  and  (2)  on  which  the  Trans-EuropeanAutomated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, is open.
Payment of Additional Amounts
All
 payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholdingfor
 or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges of whatsoever nature required tobe
 deducted or withheld by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States, unless suchwithholding or deduction is required by law.
In
 the  event  any  withholding  or  deduction  on  payments  in  respect  of  the  Notes  for  or  on  account  of  any  present  or  future  tax,assessment
 or other governmental charge is required to be deducted or withheld by the United States or any taxing authority thereofor
 therein, we will pay such additional amounts on the Notes as will result in receipt by each beneficial owner of a Note that is not aU.S.
 Person (as defined below) of such amounts (after all such withholding or deduction, including on any additional amounts) aswould
 have been received by such beneficial owner had no such withholding or deduction been required. We will not be required,however, to make any payment of additional amounts for or on account of:
i.
any tax, assessment or other governmental  charge that would not have been imposed but for (A) the existence of anypresent
 or former connection (other than a connection arising solely from the ownership of those Notes or the receipt ofpayments
 in  respect  of  those  Notes)  between  that  beneficial  owner,  or  between  a  fiduciary,  settlor,  beneficiary  of,member
 or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, that beneficial owner, if that beneficial owner is an estate, trust,partnership
 or corporation, and the United States, including that beneficial owner, or that fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,member,

 or any holder of Notes to comply with our request to comply with certification, information, documentation orother
 reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connections with the United States of thebeneficial
 owner  or  any  holder  of  the  Notes,  if  such  compliance  is  required  by  statute  or  by  regulation  of  the  U.S.Treasury
 Department as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge,including,
 without  limitation,  any  withholding  required  pursuant  to  Sections  1471  through  1474  of  the  U.S.  InternalRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “
Code ”); vii.
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed on interest received by (A) a 10% shareholder (as defined inSection

any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii).In
 addition, we will not pay any additional amounts to any beneficial owner or holder of Notes who is a fiduciary or partnership tothe

Redemption for Tax Reasons
If, as a result of any change or amendment to the laws, treaties, regulations or rulings of the United States or any political subdivision
or taxing authority thereof, any proposed change in such laws,
6

treaties,  regulations  or  rulings,  or  any  change  in  the  official  application,  enforcement  or  interpretation  of  those  laws,  treaties,regulations
 or rulings, we become, or based upon a written opinion of independent counsel selected by us, will become obligated topay
 additional  amounts  as  described  above  under  the  heading  “Payments  of  Additional  Amounts”  with  respect  to  a  series  of  theNotes,
 then we may at our option redeem, in whole, but not in part, the Notes of such series on not more than 60 days’ and not lessthan
 30 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of such series, plus accrued butunpaid interest, if any, on the Notes of such series to the date fixed for redemption.
Optional Redemption
We
 may redeem the Notes of each series, in whole or in part, at our option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part. If theNotes are
 redeemed before January 8, 2022, in the case of the 2022 Notes, and before January 8, 2026, in the case of the 2026 Notes,the Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
•
100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; or•
the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not includingany
 portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on an annualbasis (Actual/Actual (ICMA)) at the applicable
 Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below), plus 12.5 basis points, in thecase of the 2022 Notes, or 15 basis points, in the case of the 2026 Notes,
plus,
 in  each  case,  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  on  the  principal  amount  being  redeemed  to,  but  excluding,  the  date  fixed  forredemption.
Any
 2022 Notes redeemed on or after January 8, 2022, and any 2026 Notes redeemed on or after January 8, 2026, will be redeemedat
 a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaidinterest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption.
Installments
 of  interest  on  Notes  being  redeemed  that  are  due  and  payable  on  interest  payment  dates  falling  on  or  prior  to  aredemption date
 shall be payable on the interest payment date to the holders as of the close of business on the relevant regular recorddate according to the Notes and the Indenture.
“Comparable
 Government  Bond”  means,  in  relation  to  any  Comparable  Government  Bond  Rate  calculation  for  the  Notes,  at  thediscretion of an independent investment bank selected by
 us, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity ofthe
 Notes,  or  if  such  independent  investment  bank  in  its  discretion  determines  that  such  similar  bond  is  not  in  issue,  such  otherGerman
 government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in,German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.
“Comparable
 Government  Bond Rate” means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005being
 rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the Notes being redeemed, if they were to be purchased at suchprice on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such Business
Day
 of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailingat 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Business Day as determined by
7

an independent investment bank selected by us. Such independent bank will calculate such gross redemption yield on the Notes to beredeemed
 and  the  Comparable  Government  Bond  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  market  practices  at  the  time  of  suchcalculations.
Covenants
The Indenture sets forth limited covenants that apply to the Notes. However, these covenants do not, among other things:
•
limit the amount of indebtedness or lease obligations that may be incurred by us and our subsidiaries;•
limit our ability or that of our subsidiaries to issue, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens; or•
restrict us from paying dividends or making distributions on our capital stock or purchasing or redeeming our capitalstock.
Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets
The
 Indenture provides that we may amalgamate, consolidate with, merge into or transfer our assets substantially as an entirety toany person; provided that the following conditions are satisfied:
•
any successor to us (a “Successor ”) assumes our obligations on the Notes and under the Indenture; •
any Successor be an entity incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States;•
after  giving  effect  to  such  transaction,  no  event  of  default,  as  described  below  under  “-Events  of  Default,”  hasoccurred and is continuing; and
•
certain other conditions under the Indenture are met.Upon
 any amalgamation, consolidation, merger, reorganization or arrangement or any conveyance or transfer of the properties andassets of the Company substantially as an entirety, the
 Successor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every rightand power of, the Company, as the case may
 be, under the Indenture with the same effect as if such Successor had been named as theCompany therein.
Any
 such amalgamation, consolidation, merger or transfer of assets substantially as an entirety that meets the conditions describedabove
 would not constitute a default or event of default that would entitle holders of the Notes or the trustee, on their behalf, to takeany of the actions described below under “-Events of Default.”
Events of Default
Each of the following events are defined in the Indenture as an “event of default” with respect to the debt securities of any series:
i.
we fail to pay interest on any outstanding debt securities of that series when that interest is due and payable and thatfailure continues for 30 days;
ii.
we fail to pay principal of or premium, if any, on any outstanding debt securities of that series when that principal orpremium, if any, is due and payable;
8

iii.we fail to perform or we breach any covenant or warranty in the Indenture with respect to any outstanding debt securitiesof that series and that failure continues for 90 days after we receive written notice of that default;
iv.
certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur with respect to us; orv.
any other event occurs that is designated as an event of default with respect to the particular series of debt securitieswhen that particular series of debt security is established.
An
 event of default with respect to a particular series of Notes issued under the Indenture does not necessarily constitute an event ofdefault with respect to any other series of Notes issued under the Indenture.
If
 an event of default with respect to any series of outstanding debt securities occurs and is continuing (other than an event of defaultrelating
 to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us), the trustee or the holders of not less than25%
 in  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  outstanding  debt  securities  of  that  series  may  declare  the  principal  amount  of  theoutstanding
 debt  securities  of  that  series  to  be  immediately  due  and  payable.  If  an  event  of  default  relating  to  certain  events  ofbankruptcy, insolvency or
 reorganization with respect to us occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid intereston
 the then outstanding debt securities of all series issued under the Indenture will become and be immediately  due and payablewithout any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders.
The
 holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may rescind adeclaration
 of acceleration and its consequences, if we have deposited certain sums with the trustee and all events of default withrespect
 to  the  debt  securities  of  such  series,  other  than  the  nonpayment  of  the  principal  which  have  become  due  solely  by  suchacceleration, have been cured or waived, as provided in the Indenture.
An
 event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series ofdebt securities issued under the Indenture.
We
 are  required  to  file  annually  with  the  trustee  a  written  statement  as  to  the  existence  or  non-existence  of  defaults  under  theIndenture or any series of Notes.
No holder of any debt securities of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the
Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy, unless:
i.
such holder has previously given written notice to the trustee of a continuing event of default with respect to the debtsecurities of such series;
ii.
the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have made a writtenrequest to the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such event of default in its own name as trustee;
iii.
such holder or holders have offered to the trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to beincurred in compliance with such request;
iv.
the  trustee  for  60  days  after  its  receipt  of  such  notice,  request  and  offer  of  indemnity  has  failed  to  institute  any  suchproceeding; and
9

v.no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the trustee during such 60-day period by the holdersof a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series;
it
 being  understood  and  intended  that  no  one  or  more  holders  of  the  debt  securities  of  such  series  has  any  right  in  any  mannerwhatever
 by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of the Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other holdersof
 the debt securities of such series or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other such holders or to enforceany right under the Indenture, except in the
 manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the holders of the debtsecurities of such series.
The
 holders  of  a  majority  in  aggregate  principal  amount  of  outstanding  debt  securities  of  a  series  will  have  the  right,  subject  tocertain
 limitations, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee withrespect
 to the debt securities of that series or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee, and to waive certain defaults.The
 Indenture provides that if an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will exercise such of its rights and powersunder
 the  Indenture,  and  use  the  same  degree  of  care  and  skill  in  their  exercise,  as  a  prudent  person  would  exercise  under  thecircumstances in the conduct of such person’s own affairs.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any
 debt security will have the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any paymentof
 principal of and premium, if any, and interest on that debt security or any redemption price or repurchase price when due and thatthat right will not be impaired without the consent of that holder.
Modification and Waivers
We
 and the trustee may execute a supplemental indenture to add provisions to or to eliminate or change provisions of the Indentureor
 to modify otherwise the rights of the holders of the Notes if we have the consent of the holders of not less than a majority inaggregate
 principal amount of the Notes affected by that supplemental indenture. However, we and the trustee may not execute asupplemental
 indenture without the consent of each holder of the Notes affected by that supplemental indenture if that supplementindenture would, among other things:
•
change the maturity of the principal of, or the stated maturity of any installment of interest or premium, if any, on,any
 Note, reduce the principal amount of or the premium, if any, or rate of interest on any Note, change any method for determiningthe
 rate of interest on any Note, change the obligation to pay any additional amounts with respect to any Note, reduce the amountdue
 and payable on a Note upon the acceleration of its maturity or upon its repurchase or redemption if the amount payable uponacceleration,
 repurchase  or  redemption  is  otherwise  less  than  the  stated  principal  amount  of  that  Note,  change  the  method  ofcalculating
 interest on a Note, change the currency in which the principal of or the premium, if any, or interest on a Note is payable,reduce
 the minimum rate of interest on any Note or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on orwith respect to any such holder’s Notes;
•
reduce the percentage in principal amount of outstanding Notes described above as being required to consent to entryinto a particular supplemental indenture or for the waiver of certain defaults under the Indenture and their consequences; or
10

•modify the provisions of the Indenture relating to modification of the Indenture, except in certain specified respects.The trustee and we, without the consent of any holders, may execute a supplemental indenture to, among other things:
•
evidence the succession of another corporation to us and the Successor’s assumption to our covenants with respect tothe Notes and the Indenture;
•
add to our covenants further restrictions or conditions for the benefit of holders of all or any series of the Notes;•
cure ambiguities or correct or supplement any provision contained in the Indenture or any supplemental indenturethat may be inconsistent with another provision;
•
add additional events of default with respect to all or any series of the Notes;•
add to, change or eliminate any provision of the Indenture, provided that the addition, change or elimination will notaffect any outstanding Notes;
•
establish  new  series  of  Notes  and  the  form  or  terms  of  such  series  of  Notes  and  to  provide  for  the  issuance  ofsecurities of any series so established;
•
evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment of a successor trustee with respect to one or more series ofNotes and to add or change any provision to or of the Indenture as necessary to have more than one trustee under the Indenture; and
•
comply with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in order to maintain the qualificationof the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
The
 holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of a series may waive an event of default resultingin
 acceleration of the Notes of that series and rescind and annul that acceleration, but only if all other events of default with respectto
 the Notes of that series have been remedied or waived and all payments due with respect to the Notes of that series, other thanthose
 becoming due as a result of acceleration, have been made. If an event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to theNotes
 of a series, the trustee may, in its discretion, and will, at the written request of holders of not less than a majority in aggregateprincipal
 amount of the outstanding Notes of that series and upon reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities tobe
 incurred in compliance with such request and subject to certain other conditions set forth in the Indenture, proceed to protect therights
 of the holders of the Notes of that series. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of that seriesmay
 waive any past default under the Indenture and its consequences except an uncured default in the payment of principal of andpremium,
 if any, or interest on those Notes or with respect to any covenant or provision of the Indenture that the Indenture or theNotes
 specifically  provide cannot be waived without the consent of each holder of Notes of that series. Upon such a waiver, thedefault and any event of default arising out of the default will be deemed cured for all purposes of the Notes of that series.
Discharge, Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
We may, at our option, elect to have all of the obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes of any series, except for:
11

•the rights of holders of the Notes to receive payments of principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts,if any, from the trust referred to below when those payments are due;
•
our obligations respecting the Notes concerning issuing temporary debt securities, registration  of transfers of debtsecurities,
 mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen debt securities, the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money forpayments with respect to the Notes being held in trust;
•
the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee and our obligations in connection therewith; and•
the provisions of the Indenture relating to such a discharge of obligations.We refer to a discharge of this type as “
legal defeasance .” In addition,
 other than our covenant to pay the amounts due and owing with respect to the Notes of each series, we may elect to haveour
 obligations  as  the  issuer  of  the  Notes  of  any  series  released  with  respect  to  covenants  relating  to  the  Notes  of  such  series.Thereafter,
 any failure to comply with those obligations will not constitute a default or event of default with respect to the Notes ofsuch
 series. If such a release of our covenants occurs, our failure to perform or our breach of the covenants or warranties defeasedwill
 no  longer  constitute  an  event  of  default  with  respect  to  the  Notes  of  such  series.  We  refer  to  a  discharge  of  this  type  as“
covenant defeasance.” To
 exercise either of the defeasance rights described above as to the outstanding Notes of a series, certain conditions must be met,including:
•
we must irrevocably deposit with the trustee, in trust for the benefit of the holders of the outstanding Notes of theseries,
 moneys in the currency in which the Notes of such series are denominated, securities issued by a government, governmentalagency
 or central bank of the country in whose currency the Notes of such series are denominated or a combination of cash and suchsecurities,
 in amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding Notes of suchseries to be affected by the defeasance at their stated maturity;
•
no default or event of default exists on the date of such deposit, subject to certain exceptions;•
the trustee must receive an opinion of counsel confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes of such series willnot
 recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of that legal defeasance or covenant defeasanceand
 will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have beenthe
 case if that defeasance had not occurred, which opinion, only in the case of the legal defeasance of the Notes of a series, will bebased
 on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a change in United States federal income tax law to that effect occurring afterthe date of the Indenture; and
•
the trustee must receive an opinion of counsel to the effect that, after the 91st day following the deposit, the trustfunds
 will not be part of any “estate” formed by the bankruptcy of the party depositing those funds with the trustee or subject to the“automatic
 stay” under the United States Bankruptcy Code or, in the case of covenant defeasance, will be subject to a first prioritylien in favor of the trustee for the benefit of the holders of the outstanding Notes of the series.
12

We may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option.Book-Entry and Settlement
The
 Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositaryon
 behalf of Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream ”)  and Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as the operator of the EuroclearSystem
 (“Euroclear ”),  and are registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the globalnotes
 will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global notes will be made only through, records maintained byEuroclear and Clearstream. Except as described below, certificated notes will
 not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in theglobal notes.
Certificated Notes
Subject
 to certain  conditions,  the Notes represented  by the global notes are exchangeable  for certificated  debt securities  with thesame terms in authorized denominations only if:
•
The Depository Trust Company, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, is unwilling or unable to continue asdepositary
 or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law, and a successor is not appointed by us within 90 days;or
•
we decide to discontinue the book-entry system; or•
an event of default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes.Any
 Note that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered insuch
 names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a global note is not exchangeable, except for a globalnote of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee.
The Trustee for the Notes
BNYM
 is the trustee under the Indenture. We have commercial deposits and custodial arrangements with BNYM and its affiliates.We
 may enter into similar or other banking relationships with BNYM in the future in the normal course of business. In addition,BNYM
 acts as trustee and as paying agent with respect to other debt securities issued by us, and may do so for future issuances ofdebt securities by us as well.

 related  to  your  participation  in  the  Plan  and  legally  applicable  to  you  (“Tax-Related  Items”),  is  and  remains  yourresponsibility

 or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard toall
 Tax-Related Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested Restricted Stock. In the event thatsuch
 withholding  in  Shares  is  problematic  under  applicable  tax  or  securities  law  or  has  materially  adverse  accountingconsequence
s, by your acceptance of the Restricted Stock and this Agreement, you authorize and direct: (a) Walmart and anybroker
 or  other  third  party  designated  by  Walmart  to  sell  on  your  behalf  a  whole  number  of  Shares  corresponding  to  thevested
 Restricted Stock that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient tosatisfy
 the obligation for Tax-Related Items; and (b) Walmart and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their solediscretion,
 to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding, including through withholding from yourwages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.

Depending  on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Itemsby
 considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximumapplicable
 rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, youare
 deemed  to  have  been  issued  the  full  number  of  Shares  subject  to  the  vested  Restricted  Stock,  notwithstanding  that  anumber
 of  the  Shares  are  withheld  solely  for  the  purpose  of  paying  the  Tax-Related  Items.  In  the  event  that  any  excessamounts
 are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.

 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied bythe
 means previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail tocomply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

Adjustment and Vesting of the PRSUs and Delivery of Shares . A.
Performance  Period and Achievement Rates.  The Committee establishes the Performance Goals and PerformanceMeasures applicable to your PRSUs. You will receive by separate writing a notification of the performance criteria applicable
to
 your PRSUs in respect of the Performance Period set forth above which reflects the fiscal year of Walmart or, if different,the
 Affiliate that employs you (the “Employer”). The Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof)and Performance Goals as set forth in such separate writing are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
The
 number of PRSUs that ultimately may vest and, accordingly, the Shares that ultimately may be delivered to you shalldepend
 upon the degree to which the Performance Goals have been achieved, as determined by the Committee in accordancewith
 the Plan, for each Performance Measure during the Performance Period. With respect to each applicable PerformanceMeasure during the Performance Period:
1.
“Threshold”  performance means the achievement of the lowest possible Performance Goal established by theCommittee;
2.
“Target” performance means the achievement of the Performance Goal established by the Committee; and 3.
“Maximum”  performance means the highest possible achievement of the Performance Goal established by theCommittee.
An
 achievement  rate  is  determined  for  each  Performance  Measure  applicable  to  your  Plan  Award  in  respect  of  thePerformance Period. The achievement rate value applied

to each weighted Performance Measure during the Performance Period is expressed as a percentage and may range from 0%(for
 achieving  less  than  Threshold  Performance),  50%  (for  achieving  at  least,  but  no  less  than,  Threshold  performance),100%
 (for achieving Target performance), or up to 150% (for achieving Maximum performance). A percentage of 0% shallbe applied to
 a Performance Measure during the Performance Period if Threshold performance is not achieved. The weightedaverage
 of  all  applicable  achievement  rates  during  the  Performance  Period  is  referred  to  herein  as  the  “PerformanceAchievement Rate.”
At the end of the Performance Period,
 the number of PRSUs that were granted to you shall be adjusted to reflect the degree towhich
 applicable Performance Goals have been attained by multiplying :  (x) the Performance Achievement Rate and  (y) thenumber
 of  PRSUs  granted  by  this  Agreement.  Subject  to  Paragraph  10  below,  and  provided  you  have  not  incurred  aForfeiture
 Condition before the Vesting Date, the adjusted number of PRSUs (the “Adjusted PRSUs”) represent the numberof Shares you shall receive, as described in Paragraph 5.C below.

A.
your  Continuous  Status  terminates  for  any  reason  (other  than  death  or  Disability,  to  the  extent  provided  inParagraph 8 below); or
B.

Accelerated  Vesting;  Vesting  Notwithstanding  Termination  of  Continuous  Status  by  Death  or  Disability.  If  yourContinuous
 Status  is  terminated  by  reason  of  your  death  or  Disability  prior  to  the  Vesting  Date  and  you  have  not  incurred  aForfeiture
 Condition,  any PRSUs  that are scheduled  to vest within  one year of the date your Continuous  Status is terminated  byreason
 of your death or Disability will become immediately vested and such earlier vesting date shall be considered a Vesting Datefor purposes
 of this Agreement; provided, however ,  that if, as of such date the determination of attainment of Performance Goals forany
 such  PRSUs  has  not  yet  been  determined  for  your  Plan  Award,  then  achievement  of  Target  performance  for  all  applicablePerformance Goals shall be assumed for purpose of this Paragraph 8.
For
 purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of your death or the dateon which your employment or other service relationship

has been legally terminated by reason of your Disability. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” shall mean that you wouldqualify

 or,  if  different,  the  Employer,  regardless  of  whether  you  are  covered  by  such  policy.   If  Walmart  or,  if  different,  theEmployer
 does not have a long-term disability policy, for purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” means that you are unable tocarry
 out the responsibilities and functions of the position held by you by reason of any medically determined physical or mentalimpairment
 for  a  period  of  not  less  than  one  hundred  and  eighty  (180)  consecutive  days.   You  shall  not  be  considered  to  haveincurred
 a  Disability  unless  you  furnish  proof  of  such  impairment  sufficient  to  satisfy  Walmart  in  its  sole  discretion.  If  yourContinuous
 Status is terminated due to a Disability, you agree to promptly notify the Walmart Global Equity team. Notwithstandingany
 provision  of  this  Agreement,  Walmart  will  not  accelerate  your  Plan  Award  if  Walmart  has  not  received  notification  of  yourtermination
 within such period of time that it determines, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to process the settlement of your PlanAward to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
9.
Permanent Transfers Between Walmart and Walmart Affiliates . A.
Permanent Transfers and Continuous Status . For  the avoidance of doubt, a permanent transfer of Continuous Statusfrom
 Walmart,  or  the  Employer  (if  different),  to  another  Affiliate  or  from  an  Affiliate  to  Walmart  does  not  constitute  atermination of your Continuous Status.
B.
Applicable  Performance  Measures  and  Goals  Upon  Permanent  Transfer.  If  you  permanently  transfer  yourContinuous Status
 during the Performance Period, then the performance criteria and the resulting adjustment will be proratedand/or
 adjusted  to  reflect  the  proportion  of  the  Performance  Period  during  which  you  provided  service  to  Walmart,  or,  ifdifferent,
 the  Affiliate  that  initially  employed  you  (the  “Initial  Employer”)  and  the  proportion  of  the  Performance  Periodduring
 which  you  provided  service  to  Walmart  or,  if  different,  the  Affiliate  to  which  you  permanently  transferred  (the“Subsequent Employer”).
C.
Permanent  Transfers  to  Affiliate  or  Position  where  Performance-Based  Awards  are  Not  Granted.  If  youpermanently
 transfer your Continuous Status to an Affiliate or into a position where performance-based Plan Awards are notgranted,
 the performance criteria applicable for the remaining portion of your Performance Period shall be communicated toyou, and your PRSUs will be prorated and adjusted using the methodology described in Paragraph 9.B above.
D.
Transfers  to New Position with Same Employer.  If you transfer to a position with the same Employer (as definedherein)
 but your new position is subject to different applicable Performance Measures (including any applicable weightingsthereof)
 and  Performance  Goals,  then  the  performance  criteria  applicable  for  the  remaining  portion  of  your  PerformancePeriod
 shall be communicated to you, and your PRSUs will be prorated and adjusted using the methodology described inParagraph 9.B above.

10.Taxes and Tax Withholding . A.
You  agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your PRSUs and acknowledgethat you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B.
You  acknowledge  that,  regardless  of  any  action  taken  by  Walmart  (or  if  different,  the  Employer),  the  ultimateliability
 for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-relateditems
 related  to  your  participation  in  the  Plan  and  legally  applicable  to  you  (“Tax-Related  Items”)  is  and  remains  yourresponsibility
 and  may  exceed  the  amount  actually  withheld  by  Walmart  or  the  Employer.  You  further  acknowledge  thatWalmart
 and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Itemsin
 connection with any aspect of the PRSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the PRSUs, thesubsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and
are
 under no obligation to structure the terms of the PRSUs or any aspect of the PRSUs to reduce or eliminate your liabilityfor
 Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than onejurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer, as applicable) may be required to
withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C.
Prior  to  any  relevant  taxable  or  tax  withholding  event,  as  applicable,  you  agree  to  make  adequate  arrangementssatisfactory
 to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart, to satisfyany
 applicable  withholding  obligations  with  regard  to  all  Tax-Related  Items  by  withholding  of  Shares  to  be  issued  uponsettlement
 of  the  Adjusted  PRSUs.  In  the  event  that  such  withholding  in  Shares  is  problematic  under  applicable  tax  orsecurities law or
 has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptance of the PRSUs and this Agreement, youauthorize
 and direct (a) Walmart and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a wholenumber
 of  Shares  corresponding  to  the  Adjusted  PRSUs  that  Walmart  or  the  Employer  determines  to  be  appropriate  togenerate
 cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items and (b) Walmart and/or the Employer, ortheir respective agent
s, at their sole discretion to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding, includingthrough withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D.
Depending  on  the  withholding  method,  Walmart  or  the  Employer  may  withhold  or  account  for  the  Tax-RelatedItems
 by  considering  applicable  minimum  statutory  withholding  rates  or  other  applicable  withholding  rates,  includingmaximum
 applicable  rates  in  the  relevant  jurisdictions.  Further,  if  the  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  is  satisfied  bywithholding
 in  Shares,  for  tax  purposes,  you  are  deemed  to  have  been  issued  the  full  number  of  Shares  subject  to  theAdjusted PRSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-

Related Items. In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may beentitled
 to  receive  a  refund  of  any  over  withheld  amount  in  the  form  of  cash  and  will  have  no  entitlement  to  the  Shareequivalent.
E.
Finally,  you  agree  to  pay  to  Walmart  or  the  Employer  any  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  that  Walmart  or  theEmployer
 may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied bythe
 means previously described. Walmart may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, ifyou fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
