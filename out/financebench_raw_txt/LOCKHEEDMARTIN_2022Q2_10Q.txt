Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)
NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION
We prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for
interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-
X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature
necessary for a fair presentation of our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these
estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting
for sales and cost recognition; postretirement benefit plans; environmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are
probable of future recovery; evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets for impairment; income taxes including
deferred tax assets; fair value measurements; and contingencies. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries
we control and variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in
consolidation.
We close our books and records on the last Sunday of the interim calendar quarter, which was on June 26 for the second quarter of
2022 and June 27 for the second quarter of 2021, to align our financial closing with our business processes. The consolidated financial
statements and tables of financial information included herein are labeled based on that convention. This practice only affects interim periods
as our fiscal year ends on December 31.
The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or
future periods. Unless otherwise noted, we present all per share amounts cited in these consolidated financial statements on a “per diluted
share” basis. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K).
NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
The weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were as follows (in millions):
 Quarters Ended Six Months Ended
June 26,
 2022June 27,
 2021June 26,
 2022June 27,
 2021
Weighted average common shares outstanding for
basic computations 265.8 277.4 267.0 278.1 
Weighted average dilutive effect of equity awards 0.9 1.0 0.9 1.0 
Weighted average common shares outstanding for
diluted computations 266.7 278.4 267.9 279.1 
We compute basic and diluted earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the respective weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share also includes the dilutive
effects for the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs) based on the treasury stock
method. There were no significant anti-dilutive equity awards during the quarters and six months ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021.
Basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding have decreased in 2022 and 2021 due to share repurchases. See “Note
9 - Stockholders’ Equity” for more information.

NOTE 3 - INFORMATION ON BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Overview
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space.
We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.
Selected Financial Data by Business Segment
Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are
eliminated in consolidation and not included in management’s evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit
includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely
aligned with the operations of our business segments.
Summary Operating Results
Summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions):

Unallocated Items
Business segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs
not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting
standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment
operating performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, changes
in the fair value of strategic investments in companies made by our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, stock-based compensation expense,
changes in the fair value of investments held in a trust for deferred compensation plans, retiree benefits, significant severance actions,
significant asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. Excluded items are included in
the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. See
“Note 10 - Other” for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business
segments.
FAS/CAS Pension Operating Adjustment
We recover CAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S.
Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS pension cost in each of our business segment’s net sales and cost of sales. Our
consolidated financial statements must present pension and other postretirement benefit plan income calculated in accordance with FAS
requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service
cost component of FAS pension (expense) income and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension (expense) income components
are included in non-service FAS pension (expense) income in our consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS
pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income, we have a favorable FAS/CAS pension operating
adjustment.
The total FAS/CAS pension adjustment for the quarters and six months ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021, including the service
and non-service cost components of FAS pension (expense) income for our qualified defined benefit pension plans, were as follows (in
millions):

Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment $ (906) $ 583 $ (340) $ 1,165 
The decrease in the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 as compared to 2021
was principally driven by a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax)
recognized in connection with the transfer of $4.3 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an
insurance company on June 24, 2022. See “Note 6 - Postretirement Benefit Plans”.

Our Aeronautics business segment includes our largest program, the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, an international multi-role,
multi-variant, stealth fighter aircraft. Net sales for the F-35 program represented approximately 23% and 26% of our total consolidated net
sales for the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 and 27% of our total consolidated net sales for both the quarter and six months
ended June 27, 2021.

NOTE 4 - CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost
method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Contract liabilities include
advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract assets and contract liabilities were as follows (in millions):
June 26,
 2022December 31,
 2021
Contract assets $ 11,753 $ 10,579 
Contract liabilities 8,077 8,107 
Contract assets increased $1.2 billion during the six months ended June 26, 2022, due to the recognition of revenue related to the
satisfaction or partial satisfaction of performance obligations during the six months ended June 26, 2022 for which we have not yet billed our
customers (primarily on the F-35 program at Aeronautics). There were no significant credit or impairment losses related to our contract
assets during the quarters and six months ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021.
Contract liabilities decreased $30 million during the six months ended June 26, 2022, primarily due to revenue recognized in excess of
payments received on these performance obligations. During the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022, we recognized $1.4 billion
and $3.5 billion of our contract liabilities at December 31, 2021 as revenue. During the quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021, we
recognized $900 million and $3.2 billion of our contract liabilities at December 31, 2020 as revenue.(a)

NOTE 5 - INVENTORIES
Inventories consisted of the following (in millions):

Materials, spares and supplies $ 614 $ 624 
Work-in-process 2,622 2,163 
Finished goods 195 194 
Total inventories $ 3,431 $ 2,981 
Costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of the contract being awarded are included in inventories as work-in-process if we
determine that those costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and contract award is
probable, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable
(referred to as pre-contract costs). Pre-contract costs that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of sales
consistent with the transfer of products and services to the customer upon the receipt of the anticipated contract. All other pre-contract costs,
including start-up costs, are expensed as incurred. As of June 26, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $1.1 billion and $634 million of pre-contract
costs were included in inventories. The increase in pre-contract costs as of June 26, 2022 is primarily driven by delays in receiving additional
contractual authorization and funding of the Lots 15-17 contract of the F-35 program.

We record the service cost component of FAS (expense) income for our qualified defined benefit plans and retiree medical and life
insurance plans in the cost of sales accounts; the non-service components of our FAS (expense) income for our qualified defined benefit
pension plans in the non-service FAS pension (expense) income account; and the non-service components of our FAS (expense) income for
our retiree medical and life insurance plans as part of the other non-operating (expense) income, net account on our consolidated statements
of earnings.
The recognized net actuarial losses or gains and amortization of prior service credits or costs in the table above, along with similar costs
related to our other postretirement benefit plans ($6 million and $11 million for the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 and
$3 million and $7 million for the quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021) were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss
(AOCL) and recorded as a component of FAS (expense) income for the periods presented. These costs totaled $62 million ($47 million, net
of tax) and $123 million ($95 million, net of tax) during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022, and $177 million ($140 million, net
of tax) and $355 million ($280 million, net of tax) during the quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021 and were recorded on our
consolidated statements of comprehensive income as an increase to other comprehensive income.
Purchase of Group Annuity Contracts and Pension Remeasurement
On June 24, 2022, we purchased group annuity contracts to transfer $4.3 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related
plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 13,600 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The group annuity contracts were purchased
using assets from Lockheed Martin’s master retirement trust and no additional funding contribution was required. This transaction had no
impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with
this transaction, we recognized a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax)
for the affected plans in the quarter ended June 26, 2022, which represents the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included
in the AOCL account within stockholders’ equity.
As a result of this transaction, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets for the affected defined benefit
pension plans as of the June 24, 2022 close date. The remeasurement reflects the use of an updated discount rate and actual return on plan
assets.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the benefit obligations, plan assets and net unfunded status related to all of our qualified
defined benefit pension plans, inclusive of the plans affected by the interim remeasurement and plans that were not affected, for the six
months ended June 26, 2022 (in millions):
Change in benefit obligation
Beginning balance at December 31, 2021 $ 43,447 
Service cost 48 
Interest cost 605 
Benefits paid (776)
Settlements (4,309)

Actuarial (gains) losses (7,928)
Ending balance at June 26, 2022 $ 31,117 
Change in plan assets
Beginning balance at December 31, 2021 $ 35,192 
Actual return on plan assets (4,734)
Benefits paid (776)
Settlements (4,309)
Ending balance at June 26, 2022 $ 25,373 
Net unfunded status of the plans $ (5,744)
Represents the transfer of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company pursuant to the group annuity contracts purchased
on June 24, 2022, as described above.
Primarily reflects an increase in the discount rate from 2.875% at December 31, 2021 to 4.75% at the remeasurement date.
The actual return on plan assets for the period January 1, 2022 through the June 24, 2022 remeasurement date for the affected plans was approximately (16%), or
$(4.7) billion which was approximately $5.7 billion lower (the incremental loss) than our expected return on plan assets of 3.25% for the period, or $1.0 billion (the
proportional effect, or approximately half of our expected 6.50% annual long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption), for the period.
For plans where the benefit obligation is in excess of plan assets, we report the net obligation (which was $5,808 million as of June 26, 2022) as part of accrued pension
liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Conversely, for plans where the assets exceed the benefit obligation, we include the net asset (which was $64 million as of
June 26, 2022) as part of other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet. The net unfunded status of the plans of $5,744 million in the table above represents
the net total of these two amounts.
The plan remeasurement resulted in a decrease of $2.2 billion to our net unfunded pension obligations (which includes the change in
benefit obligation due to remeasurement of $7.9 billion and the incremental loss on plan assets recognized in remeasurement of $5.7 billion)
with a corresponding increase of $1.7 billion after taxes in stockholders’ equity. The change in stockholders’ equity reflects the decrease in
deferred actuarial losses, which will be recognized as an increase in net FAS pension income (or a decrease in net FAS pension expense)
over the estimated remaining life expectancy of the covered employees beginning in the third quarter of 2022.
We now expect FAS pension expense of approximately $1.1 billion in 2022, inclusive of the noncash, non-operating pension settlement
charge of $1.5 billion (pretax) described above. Excluding the noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge, our expected FAS pension
income will be approximately $410 million in 2022, which is $50 million lower than our prior 2022 FAS pension income estimate of
$460 million.
Funding requirements
The required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, along with consideration of CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made no contributions to
our qualified defined benefit pension plans during the quarters and six months ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021.(a)

NOTE 7 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES
We are a party to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising under
provisions relating to the protection of the environment, and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned.
These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-
monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings
described below, will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any
matter may have a material effect on our net earnings and cash flows in any particular interim reporting period. Among the factors that we
consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if
estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in
similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the
proceeding or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.
Although we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that
a loss may have been incurred, GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a
statement that such an estimate cannot be made. We follow a thorough process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or
range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made.
Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated
with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.
Legal Proceedings
United States of America, ex rel. Patzer; Cimma v. Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., et al.
As a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky), we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two
civil False Claims Act lawsuits pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In October 2014, the U.S. Government
filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Mary Patzer, a former Derco Aerospace (Derco)
employee. In May 2017, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in a second suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Peter
Cimma, a former Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI) employee. In November 2017, the Court consolidated the cases into a single action
for discovery and trial.
The U.S. Government alleges that Sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco and SSSI, violated the civil False Claims
Act and the Truth in Negotiations Act in connection with a contract the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 to support the Navy’s T-34
and T-44 fixed-wing turboprop training aircraft. SSSI subcontracted with Derco, primarily to procure and manage spare parts for the training
aircraft. The U.S. Government contends that SSSI overbilled the Navy on the contract as the result of Derco’s use of prohibited cost-plus-
percentage-of-cost (CPPC) pricing to add profit and overhead costs as a percentage of the price of the spare parts that Derco procured and
then sold to SSSI. The U.S. Government also alleges that Derco’s claims to SSSI, SSSI’s claims to the Navy, and SSSI’s yearly Certificates
of Final Indirect Costs from 2006 through 2012 were false and that SSSI submitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the Truth in
Negotiations Act for a sole-sourced, follow-on “bridge” contract. The U.S. Government’s complaints assert common law claims for breach of
contract and unjust enrichment. On November 29, 2021, the District Court granted the U.S. Government’s motion for partial summary
judgment, finding that the Derco-SSSI agreement was a CPPC contract.
We believe that we have legal and factual defenses to the U.S. Government’s remaining claims. The U.S. Government seeks damages
of approximately $52 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory penalties. Although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure, we do
not currently believe that it is probable that we will incur a material loss. If, contrary to our expectations, the U.S. Government prevails on the
remaining issues in this matter and proves damages at or near $52 million and is successful in having such damages trebled, the outcome
could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability is recognized and on our cash flows for the period in
which any damages are paid.

Lockheed Martin v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority
On April 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its Capital
Construction Company (collectively, the MTA) asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to find that the MTA is in
material breach of our agreement based on the MTA’s failure to provide access to sites where work must be performed and the customer-
furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract. The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract
and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract
and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of
re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the
MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTA’s allegations and are defending against them. Additionally,
following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel,
concluded that the MTA’s termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include
claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District Court in
December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. We continue to await a decision from the
District Court. Although this matter relates to our former Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, we retained responsibility
for the litigation when we divested IS&GS in 2016.
Environmental Matters
We are involved in proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil, sediment, surface water, and groundwater contamination,
disposal of hazardous substances, and other environmental matters at several of our current or former facilities, facilities for which we may
have contractual responsibility, and at third-party sites where we have been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP). A
substantial portion of environmental costs will be included in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S. Government
regulations. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record assets for estimated future recovery considered
probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-
reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of
future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our
history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement. We
include the portions of those environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts, or determined not to be
recoverable under U.S. Government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established or adjusted.
At June 26, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of liabilities recorded relative to environmental matters was
$726 million and $742 million, most of which are recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We have
recorded assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery totaling $630 million and $645 million at June 26,
2022 and December 31, 2021, most of which are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating liabilities a matter of judgment because of
uncertainties with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination as well as such factors as changing remediation technologies and
changing regulatory environmental standards. We are monitoring or investigating a number of former and present operating facilities for
potential future remediation. We perform quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites and the related liabilities and
receivables. Additionally, in our quarterly reviews, we consider these and other factors in estimating the timing and amount of any future
costs that may be required for remediation activities, and we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has occurred or will occur for a
particular site and the loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred
for remediation for that site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or
cannot be reliably determined. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure in all cases as, although a loss may be
probable or reasonably possible, in some cases it is not possible at this time to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. We
project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)
We also pursue claims for recovery of costs incurred or for contribution to site remediation costs against other PRPs, including the U.S.
Government, and are conducting remediation activities under various consent decrees, orders, and agreements relating to soil, groundwater,
sediment, or surface water contamination at certain sites of former or current operations. Under agreements related to certain sites in
California, New York, United States Virgin Islands and Washington, the U.S. Government and/or a private party reimburses us an amount
equal to a percentage, specific to each site, of expenditures for certain remediation activities in their capacity as PRPs under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, potential new regulations of perchlorate and hexavalent
chromium at the federal and state level could adversely affect us. In particular, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is
considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium at the federal level and the California State Water Resources Control Board continues
to reevaluate its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate.
If substantially lower standards are adopted for perchlorate in California or for hexavalent chromium at the federal level, we expect a
material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable
of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S.
Government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a
material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.
We also are evaluating the potential impact of existing and contemplated legal requirements addressing a class of chemicals known
generally as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS have been used ubiquitously, such as in fire-fighting foams, manufacturing
processes, and stain- and stick-resistant products (e.g., Teflon, stain-resistant fabrics). Because we have used products and processes over
the years containing some of those compounds, they likely exist as contaminants at many of our environmental remediation
sites. Governmental authorities have announced plans, and in some instances have begun, to regulate certain of these compounds at
extremely low concentrations in drinking water, which could lead to increased cleanup costs at many of our environmental remediation sites.
Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Third-Party Guarantees
We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly
issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain
contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may
guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. We had total outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds
and third-party guarantees aggregating $3.6 billion at both June 26, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Third-party guarantees do not include
guarantees issued on behalf of subsidiaries and other consolidated entities.
At June 26, 2022 and December 31, 2021, third-party guarantees totaled $865 million and $838 million, of which approximately 70%
related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts
represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint
venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may
be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.
In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit
quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as
required by the FAR. At June 26, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related
to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.
Other
As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to various audits and investigations by the U.S. Government to determine whether our
operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. U.S. Government investigations of us, whether
relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including
repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, suspension, proposed debarment, debarment from eligibility for future U.S.
Government contracting, or suspension of export

privileges. Suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence on contracts with the U.S.
Government. U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. We also provide
products and services to customers outside of the U.S., which are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and foreign procurement
policies and practices. Our compliance with local regulations or applicable U.S. Government regulations also may be audited or investigated.
In the normal course of business, we provide warranties to our customers associated with certain product sales. We record estimated
warranty costs in the period in which the related products are delivered. The warranty liability is generally based on the number of months of
warranty coverage remaining for the products delivered and the average historical monthly warranty payments. Warranty obligations incurred
in connection with long-term production contracts are accounted for within the contract estimates at completion.
NOTE 8 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (in millions):

Assets measured at NAV 
Other commingled funds —   20   
Net Asset V alue (NA V) is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund’ s shares outstanding.
Substantially all assets measured at fair value, other than derivatives, represent investments held in a separate trust to fund certain of
our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair
values of mutual funds and certain other securities are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in active markets
multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. The fair values of U.S. Government and certain other
securities are determined using pricing models that use observable inputs (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly
quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. The fair values of derivative
instruments, which consist of foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts, including embedded derivatives, and interest rate swap
contracts, are primarily determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable
inputs such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates.
We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are
subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option
contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the
British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian kroner and the Polish zloty. These contracts hedge
forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to minimize fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate
changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting
fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair
value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate
borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also
may enter into(a)

Lockheed Martin Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)
derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain
economic exposures.
The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps was $1.3 billion and $500 million at June 26, 2022 and
December 31, 2021. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was $5.5 billion and $4.0 billion at June 26,
2022 and December 31, 2021. The fair values of our outstanding interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges at June 26, 2022 and
December 31, 2021 were not significant. Derivative instruments did not have a material impact on net earnings and comprehensive income
during the quarters and six months ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021. The impact of derivative instruments on our consolidated
statements of cash flows is included in net cash provided by operating activities. Substantially all of our derivatives are designated for hedge
accounting.
We also hold investments in public companies, primarily as a result of investments in early-stage companies through our Lockheed
Martin Ventures Fund. These investments have quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) and are recorded at fair value and reflected
in other securities in the table above. See “Note 10 - Other - Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund” for more information on Lockheed Martin
Ventures investments.
In addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and debt. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts
payable approximated their fair values. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $12.5 billion and $15.4 billion at June 26, 2022
and December 31, 2021. The outstanding principal amount of debt was $12.8 billion at both June 26, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
excluding $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of unamortized discounts and issuance costs at June 26, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The estimated
fair values of our outstanding debt were determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use
observable inputs such as interest rates and credit spreads (Level 2).
NOTE 9 - STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Repurchases of Common Stock
During the six months ended June 26, 2022, we repurchased 7.7 million shares of our common stock for $2.4 billion, including pursuant
to accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. As previously disclosed, in January 2022, we received 2.2 million shares of our common
stock for no additional consideration upon final settlement of the ASR we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, we
repurchased 4.7 million shares for $2.0 billion under an ASR agreement that we entered into in the first quarter of 2022 and that settled in the
second quarter of 2022. Some of the shares repurchased during the second quarter of 2022 were settled subsequent to the end of the
quarter.
The total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our share repurchase program was $1.6 billion as of
June 26, 2022. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the
excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we
record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings.
Dividends
We declared cash dividends totaling $2.2 billion ($8.40 per share) during the six months ended June 26, 2022. In June 2022, we
declared our 2022 third quarter dividend totaling approximately $743 million ($2.80 per share), which will be paid in September 2022. The
total amount declared may differ from the total amount of dividends paid during a period due to the timing of dividend-equivalents paid on
RSUs and PSUs. These dividend-equivalents are accrued during the vesting period and are paid upon the vesting of the RSUs and PSUs,
which primarily occurs in the first quarter each year.

Balance at June 27, 2021 $ (15,875)$ 38 $ (15,837)
Changes in AOCL before reclassifications related to our postretirement benefit plans represent the net actuarial gains from the interim remeasurement
of certain defined benefit pension plans required as a result of the purchase of group annuity contracts to transfer $4.3 billion of our gross defined
benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company on June 24, 2022. See “Note 6 - Postretirement Benefit Plans”. Also as a
result, during the quarter ended June 26, 2022, we recognized a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or
$4.33 per share, after-tax).
These amounts include $47 million and $140 million, net of tax, for the quarters ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021, which are comprised of the
recognition of net actuarial losses of $1 15 million and $204 million for the quarters ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021, and the amortization of net
prior service credits of $68 million and $64 million for the quarters ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021.
NOTE 10 - OTHER
Changes in Estimates
Significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of
a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as
variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider
the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number
and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial
cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The
initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in
the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we
successfully retire risks related to technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete
the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may
decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive
decrease. All of the estimates are(a)

Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)
subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred
on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded
in the period in which the loss is determined.
In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by
changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost
method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments,
usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular
contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, for example COVID-19 impacts or supply chain disruptions,
resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are
typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and
reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by
other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries
on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse
resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating
results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.
Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, increased
segment operating profit by approximately $455 million and $860 million during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 and
$385 million and $880 million during the quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021. These adjustments increased net earnings by
approximately $359 million ($1.35 per share) and $679 million ($2.53 per share) during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 and
$304 million ($1.09 per share) and $695 million ($2.49 per share) during the quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021. We recognized
net sales from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods of approximately $481 million and $897 million during the quarter and six
months ended June 26, 2022, and $492 million and $984 million during the quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021, which primarily
relate to changes in profit booking rates that impacted revenue.
We have experienced performance issues on a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract that involves highly complex design and
systems integration at our Aeronautics business segment. As of June 26, 2022, cumulative losses remained at approximately $225 million.
We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to
record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth, which could be
material to our operating results. In addition, we and our industry team will incur advanced procurement costs (also referred to as precontract
costs) in order to enhance our ability to achieve the revised schedule and certain milestones. We will monitor the recoverability of precontract
costs, which could be impacted by the customer’s decision regarding future phases of the program.
We are responsible for a program to design, develop and construct a ground-based radar at our RMS business segment. The program
has experienced performance issues for which we have periodically accrued reserves. As of June 26, 2022, cumulative losses remained at
approximately $280 million. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the
program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost
growth. However, based on the losses previously recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this
time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.
We have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers -
intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued
reserves at our RMS business segment. We last recorded a charge and accrued reserves for this program in 2017. During the second
quarter of 2022, the program was completed with a settlement of all claims between the parties and, as such, we determined that additional
losses will not be incurred. Total cumulative losses on this program were approximately $260 million at June 26, 2022.
Backlog
Backlog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and
services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. Our backlog includes both funded (firm
24
Table of Contents
Lockheed Martin Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)
orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded (firm
orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. We do not include unexercised options or potential orders under indefinite-
delivery, indefinite-quantity agreements in our backlog. For our cost-reimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated
consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. The estimated
consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. In determining the
estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate
of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such
contracts are successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in a reduction of backlog without a
corresponding recognition of sales. As of June 26, 2022, our ending backlog was $134.6 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 36%
of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 59% over the next 24 months as revenue with the remainder recognized
thereafter.
Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund
Through our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, we make strategic investments in companies that we believe are advancing or developing
new technologies applicable to our business. These investments may be in the form of common or preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt
securities or investments in funds. Most of the investments are in equity securities without readily determinable fair values (privately held
securities), which are measured initially at cost and are then adjusted to fair value only if there is an observable price change or reduced for
impairment, if applicable. Investments with quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) (publicly held securities) are recorded at fair
value. The carrying amounts of investments held in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund were $451 million and $465 million at June 26, 2022
and December 31, 2021. Due to changes in fair value and/or sales of investments, we recorded net losses of $143 million ($107 million, or
$0.40 per share, after-tax) and $40 million ($30 million, or $0.11 per share, after-tax) during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022;
and net gains of $14 million ($11 million, or $0.04 per share, after-tax) and $82 million ($62 million, or $0.22 per share, after-tax) during the
quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021. These gains and losses are reflected in the other non-operating (expense) income, net
account on our consolidated statements of earnings.
Income Taxes
Our effective income tax rates were 6.4% and 14.6% and 16.4% and 16.6% for the quarters and six months ended June 26, 2022 and
June 27, 2021. The rate for the second quarter of 2022 is lower than the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to lower earnings before
income taxes resulting from a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion, which reduced the tax expense by
approximately $314 million. The rates for all periods benefited from the research and development tax credit, tax deductions for foreign
derived intangible income and dividends paid to the corporation's defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature.
Severance and Restructuring Charges
During the first quarter of 2021, we recorded severance and restructuring charges of $36 million ($28 million, or $0.10 per share, after-
tax) related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs within our RMS business segment. These actions were taken to consolidate certain
operations in order to improve the efficiency of RMS’ manufacturing operations and affordability of its products and services. Employees
terminated as part of these actions were to receive lump-sum severance payments upon separation primarily based on years of service.
Debt Issuance and Redemption
On May 5, 2022, we issued a total of $2.3 billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $800 million aggregate principal amount of
3.90% Notes due June 15, 2032 (the “2032 Notes”), $850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.15% Notes due June 15, 2053 (the “2053
Notes”) and $650 million aggregate principal amount of 4.30% Notes due June 15, 2062 (the “2062 Notes” and, together with the 2032 Notes
and 2053 Notes, the “Notes”) in a registered public offering. Net proceeds received from the offering were after deducting pricing discounts
and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized and recorded as interest expense over the term of the Notes. We will pay interest on the
Notes semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year with the first payment made on June 15, 2022. We may, at our
option, redeem the Notes of any series in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of
100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or an applicable make-whole amount, plus accrued
25
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)
and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness.
On May 11, 2022, we used the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to redeem all of the outstanding $500 million in aggregate
principal amount of our 3.10% Notes due 2023, $750 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.90% Notes due 2025, and the remaining
balance of the net proceeds to redeem $1.0 billion of our outstanding $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 3.55% Notes due 2026
at their redemption price. We paid make-whole premiums of $13.9 million in connection with the early extinguishments of debt. We incurred
losses of $34 million ($26 million, or $0.10 per share, after tax) on these transactions related to early extinguishments of debt, additional
interest expense and other related charges, which was recorded in other non-operating (expense) income, net in our consolidated
statements of earnings.
NOTE 11 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit
the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which have been widely used as reference rates for various
securities and financial contracts, including loans, debt and derivatives. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the
current basis is not guaranteed after 2021. Subsequently in March 2021, the FCA announced some USD LIBOR tenors (overnight, 1 month,
3 month, 6 month and 12 month) will continue to be published until June 30, 2023. Regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions have been
working to replace these rates with alternative reference interest rates that are supported by transactions in liquid and observable markets,
such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for USD LIBOR. Currently, our credit facility and certain of our derivative instruments
reference LIBOR-based rates. Our credit facility contains provisions specifying alternative interest rate calculations to be employed when
LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark and we have adhered to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which will govern our
derivatives upon the final cessation of USD LIBOR. ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of
Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, as amended, limits the accounting impact from contract modifications, including hedging
relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates that are completed by December 31, 2022. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently working on a project to extend the date to December 31, 2024. We do not expect a
significant impact to our financial results, financial position or cash flows from the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates,
but we will continue to monitor the impact of this transition until it is completed.

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Lockheed Martin Corporation (the Corporation) as of June 26, 2022, the
related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and equity for the quarters and six months ended June 26, 2022 and
June 27, 2021, and consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material
modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),
the consolidated balance sheet of the Corporation as of December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings,
comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated
January 25, 2022, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
Basis for Review Results
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A
review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB,
the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express
such an opinion.

ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the
reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in
conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration
and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering,
technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products
and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government.
During the six months ended June 26, 2022, 73% of our $30.4 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime
contractor or as a subcontractor (including 64% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 26% were from international customers (including
foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main
areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.
The following discussion is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K).
COVID-19
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continued to cause business impacts in the first six months of 2022 primarily
driven by the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021 with a resulting increase in COVID cases in early 2022. During the first six
months of 2022, our performance was adversely affected by supply chain disruptions and delays, as well as labor challenges associated with
employee absences, travel restrictions, site access, quarantine restrictions, remote work, and adjusted work schedules. Attendance for
employees required to be onsite has fluctuated based on pandemic developments. We are actively engaging with our customers and are
continuing to take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees. In our on-going effort to mitigate supply chain risks, we
accelerated payments of $1.0 billion to our suppliers as of June 26, 2022, that are due according to contractual terms in future periods, while
consistently prioritizing small businesses, which make up over half of our active supply base, as well as at-risk businesses.
The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance in future periods, including our ability to execute our
programs in the expected timeframe, remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic-related developments, including the duration of
the pandemic, potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection or potential new variants, the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19
vaccines and therapeutics, supplier impacts and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread, including the
implementation of any federal, state, local or foreign vaccine mandates, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The long-term
impacts of COVID-19 on government budgets and other funding priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our
products and services are also difficult to predict, but could negatively affect our future results and performance.
For additional risks to the corporation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2021 Form 10-K.
Inflation
Heightened levels of inflation continue to present risk for Lockheed Martin and the broader industrial base. We have experienced
impacts to our labor rates and suppliers have signaled inflation related cost pressures, which will flow through to our costs and pricing.
Although we have not seen a significant impact from inflation to our financial results in the first half of 2022, if inflation remains at current
levels for an extended period, or increases, and we are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our costs could increase, resulting in
pressure on our profits and margins, particularly for existing fixed-price contracts. For new contract proposals, we are factoring into our
pricing heightened levels of inflation based on accepted DoD escalation indices and other assumptions, and in some cases seeking the
inclusion of economic price adjustment (EPA) clauses, which would permit, subject to the particular contractual terms, cost adjustments in
fixed price
28
Table of Contents
contracts for unexpected inflation. Overall, inflation and the potential worsening of macro-economic conditions are a risk to our operations,
suppliers and the stability of the defense industrial base. In addition, inflation and the increases in the cost of borrowing from rising interest
rates could constrain the overall purchasing power of our customers for our products and services. Rising interest rates also will increase our
borrowing costs on new debt and could affect the fair value of our investments. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the
efficiency of our operations and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services, which may, in part, offset
cost increases from inflation.
Conflict in Ukraine
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has elevated global geopolitical tensions and security concerns. As a result, we have received increased
interest for our products and services as countries seek to improve their security posture, particularly in Europe. We expect this interest will
result in new contracts, however, given the long-cycle nature of our business, it is hard to predict when any resulting sales would occur from
potential new contracts and we do not expect a significant increase in 2022 sales from new contracts in response to the conflict. We are
evaluating capacity at our operations and the supply chain to anticipate potential demand and enable us to deliver critical capabilities. In
addition, the U.S. Government and other nations have implemented broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting Russia, which,
combined with the conflict, have the potential to indirectly disrupt our supply chain and access to certain resources. We have not, however,
experienced significant adverse impacts to date and will continue to monitor for any impacts and seek to mitigate disruption that may arise.
The conflict also has increased the threat of malicious cyber activity from nation states and other actors. We have taken steps designed to
enhance our defensive posture against tactics and techniques associated with this increased threat.
INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS
U.S. Government Funding
On March 15, 2022, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, providing annual funding for the Department of
Defense (DoD) and other government departments and agencies. The appropriation provided $781 billion for national defense, which
includes the DoD, Department of Energy (DoE) nuclear weapons-related activities, and the national security activities of the Coast Guard,
Federal Bureau of Investigation, and others. The DoD portion was $742.3 billion, $25 billion more than the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2022
request. Additionally, the legislation included $13.6 billion in supplemental funding to support Ukraine, including $3.5 billion for defense
articles and $650 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Ukraine and other Eastern European allies. Our programs continued to be
well supported and funded through the FY 2022 budget process. On May 21, 2022, the President signed the Additional Ukraine
Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022, providing an additional $40 billion to support Ukraine. This included $6 billion in security assistance,
$9 billion to replenish U.S. stocks, and $4 billion for Foreign Military Financing (FMF).
On March 28, 2022, the Administration submitted to Congress the President’s FY 2023 budget request, which proposes $813 billion for
national defense. The DoD portion of this request is $773 billion, a 4% increase above the FY 2022 enacted amount. In June 2022, the
Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) and House Armed Services Committee (HASC) reported their versions of the FY 2023 National
Defense Authorizations Act (NDAA), and the House Appropriations Committee (HAC) reported their version of the FY 2023 Defense
Appropriations Act. As anticipated, the SASC and the HASC provided additional funds for DoD, $45 billion and $37 billion, respectively. The
HAC marked to the President’s budget request. On July 14, 2022, the full House passed the FY 2023 NDAA, maintaining the additional $37
billion provided by the HASC. The Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC) has not yet announced when it will consider its version of the FY
2023 Defense Appropriations Act. The continued expectation is that final FY 2023 DoD funding will be higher than requested. Final
legislation is not expected to be enacted until late in calendar year 2022 or, possibly, in early calendar year 2023.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our operating cycle is primarily long-term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of
products and related activities with varying delivery schedules. Consequently, the results of operations of a particular period, or period-to-
period comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results
among periods should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share”
basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data):

Certain amounts reported in other income, net, including our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in
the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in the discussion of our business segment results of
operations.
Net Sales
We generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows
(in millions):

Total net sales $ 15,446 $ 17,029 $ 30,410 $ 33,287 
Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Under the percentage-of-
completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular
contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net
sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment
results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the
nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Overall, our sales were negatively affected in the first six months of 2022
because of supply chain impacts.

Table of Contents
Product Sales
Product sales decreased $1.5 billion, or 10%, during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease is primarily attributable to lower product sales of approximately $780 million at Aeronautics mostly due to lower volume on F-35
contracts; about $370 million at Space primarily due to the previously announced renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment
(AWE) program on June 30, 2021, which was no longer included in our financial results beginning in the third quarter of 2021; approximately
$220 million at RMS mostly due to lower production volume on Black Hawk; and about $130 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on
air dominance weapon systems and close out activities in the second quarter of 2021 related to the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program
(Warrior).
Product sales decreased $2.8 billion, or 10%, during the six months ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease is primarily attributable to lower product sales of approximately $840 million at Aeronautics mostly due to lower volume on F-35
contracts; about $820 million at Space primarily due to the renationalization of AWE; approximately $730 million at RMS mostly due to lower
net sales for training and logistics solutions (TLS) programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of
2021 and lower production volume on Black Hawk; and about $365 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on Terminal High Altitude
Area Defense (THAAD) and air dominance weapon systems.
Service Sales
Service sales decreased $86 million, or 3%, during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease in service sales was primarily attributable to lower sales of approximately $70 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on
Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS).
Service sales decreased $121 million, or 2%, during the six months ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease in service sales was primarily due to lower sales of approximately $130 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on SOF
GLSS.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs
(overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as
offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and
amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of
sales were as follows (in millions):

The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with
the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. Except for potential
impacts to our programs resulting from COVID-19, supply chain disruptions and inflation, we have not identified any additional developing
trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.

Product Costs
Product costs decreased $1.5 billion, or 11%, during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower product costs of approximately $835 million at Aeronautics primarily due to lower volume on F-35
contracts; about $330 million at Space mostly due to the renationalization of AWE; approximately $175 million at RMS primarily due to lower
production volume on Black Hawk; and about $130 million at MFC mostly due to lower volume on air dominance weapon systems and close
out of the Warrior program in 2021.
Product costs decreased $2.6 billion, or 10%, during the six months ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower product costs of approximately $860 million at Aeronautics mostly due to lower volume on F-35
contracts; about $750 million at Space primarily due to the renationalization of AWE; approximately $625 million at RMS mostly due to the
delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021 and lower production volume on Black Hawk; and about
$355 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on THAAD and air dominance weapon systems.
Service Costs
Service costs decreased $76 million, or 3%, during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower service costs of approximately $65 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on SOF GLSS.
Service costs decreased $131 million, or 3%, during the six months ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower service costs of approximately $125 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on SOF GLSS.
Other Unallocated, Net
Other unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment (which represents the difference between CAS
pension cost recorded in our business segment’s results of operations and the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income),
stock-based compensation expense, changes in the fair value of investments held in a trust for deferred compensation plans and other
corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or
services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $267 million and $548 million during the quarter and six months ended June 26,
2022, compared to $426 million and $901 million during the quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021. Other unallocated, net during the
quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 was lower primarily due to declines in the fair value of investments held in a trust for deferred
compensation plans during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, a decrease in our
FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment due to lower CAS cost from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) legislation, and
fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant.
Severance and Restructuring Charges
During the first quarter of 2021, we recorded severance and restructuring charges of $36 million ($28 million, or $0.10 per share, after-
tax) associated with plans to close and consolidate certain facilities and reduce total workforce within our RMS business segment. See “Note
10 - Other” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net primarily includes earnings generated by equity method investees. Other income, net was $7 million and $31 million
during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022, compared to $41 million and $37 million during the quarter and six months ended
June 27, 2021. Other income, net during the quarter
ended June 26, 2022 included lower earnings generated by our equity method investment in ULA due to lower launch volume and launch
vehicle mix.
Interest Expense
Interest expense during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 was $141 million and $276 million, compared to $142 million
and $282 million during the quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021. See “Capital
32
Table of Contents
Resources” included within “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 - Other” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.
Non-Service FAS Pension (Expense) Income
Non-service FAS pension expense was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022, compared to
FAS pension income of $94 million and $187 million during the quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021. Non-service FAS pension
expense for the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 includes a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion
($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax), related to the transfer of $4.3 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related
plan assets to an insurance company. See “Note 6 - Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.
Other Non-operating (Expense) Income, Net
Other non-operating (expense) income, net primarily includes gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of strategic
investments in companies made by our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. During the quarter ended June 26, 2022, other non-operating
expense, net was $161 million compared to other non-operating income, net of $26 million during the quarter ended June 27, 2021. During
the six months ended June 26, 2022, other non-operating expense, net was $38 million compared to other non-operating income, net of
$102 million during the six months ended June 27, 2021. The decrease during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 was
primarily due to decreases in the fair value of investments held in this fund and losses related to early extinguishments of debt. See “Note
10 - Other” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Income Tax Expense
Our effective income tax rates were 6.4% and 14.6% for the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 and 16.4% and 16.6% for the
quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021. The rate for the second quarter of 2022 is lower than the second quarter of 2021 primarily due
to lower earnings before income taxes resulting from a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion, which reduced the
tax expense by approximately $314 million. The rates for all periods benefited from the research and development tax credit, tax deductions
for foreign derived intangible income and dividends paid to the corporation's defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership
plan feature.
Changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with
retroactive effect, including the amortization for research or experimental expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income
taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders’ equity. Proposals to increase the U.S.
corporate income tax rate would require us to increase our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a
corresponding material, one-time, noncash decrease in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would likely be
materially increased in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets were $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion at June 26, 2022 and December 31,
2021, based on a 21% federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plans. In addition to future changes
in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our
postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans and the reevaluation of uncertain tax
positions.
Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures
immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years. While it is possible that Congress
may defer, modify, or repeal this provision, potentially with retroactive effect, and we continue to have ongoing discussions with members of
Congress, both on our own and with other industries through coalitions, we have no assurance that this provision will be deferred, modified,
or repealed. Furthermore, in anticipation of the new provision taking effect, we analyzed the provision and worked with our advisors to
evaluate its application to our business. We anticipate our cash from operations in 2022 will be negatively impacted by approximately $500
million and our net deferred tax assets will increase by a similar amount provided this provision is not deferred, modified, or repealed. The
actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022
among other factors. While the largest impact of this provision will be to 2022 cash from operations, the impact would continue over the five-
year amortization period, but would decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six.
We are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (including in, amongst others, Australia,
Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, and the United Kingdom). The final determination of tax audits and
33
Table of Contents
any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.
Net Earnings
We reported net earnings of $309 million ($1.16 per share) and $2.0 billion ($7.62 per share) during the quarter and six months ended
June 26, 2022, compared to $1.8 billion ($6.52 per share) and $3.7 billion ($13.08 per share) during the quarter and six months ended
June 27, 2021. Net earnings and earnings per share for both the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 were affected by factors
mentioned above, including the noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax)
related to the transfer of $4.3 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company. Earnings
per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 11.7 million and 11.2 million weighted average common shares outstanding
during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021. The reduction in weighted average common
shares was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution
plans.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature
of products and services offered.
Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are
eliminated in consolidation and not included in management’s evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit
includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely
aligned with the operations of our business segments.
Business segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs
not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting
standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment
operating performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, changes
in the fair value of strategic investments in companies made by our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, stock-based compensation expense,
changes in the fair value of investments held in a trust for deferred compensation plans, retiree benefits, significant severance actions,
significant asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. Excluded items are included in
the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.

Table of Contents
Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under U.S. Government Cost Accounting
Standards (CAS), which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the
pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS pension cost in each of our business
segment’s net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present pension and other postretirement benefit plan
income calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment
represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income and total CAS pension cost. The non-
service FAS pension (expense) income components are included in non-service FAS pension (expense) income in our consolidated
statements of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension (expense)
income, we have a favorable FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment.
The total FAS/CAS pension adjustment for the quarters and six months ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021, including the service
and non-service cost components of FAS pension (expense) income for our qualified defined benefit pension plans, were as follows (in

Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment $ (906) $ 583 $ (340) $ 1,165 
The decrease in the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 as compared to 2021
was principally driven by a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax)
recognized in connection with the transfer of $4.3 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an
insurance company on June 24, 2022. See “Note 6 - Postretirement Benefit Plans”.
Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of
operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent
with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management
assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar
manner through their completion.
We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated
in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align
to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed
(such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our
contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to
provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of
our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to
coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.
Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and
monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our
estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the
36
Table of Contents
technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and
type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation
agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit
booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial
estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully
retire risks related to the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the
contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates
are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate.
We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government which cannot be specifically described. The
operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same
oversight and internal controls as our other programs.
Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS
contracted through the U.S. Government. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of
the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is
recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion
cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our
contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in
time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.
Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or
decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual
contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.
In addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by
changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost
method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments,
usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular
contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, for example COVID-19 impacts or supply chain disruptions,
resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are
typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and
reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by
other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries
on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse
resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating
results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.
Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters, increased
segment operating profit by approximately $455 million and $860 million during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022 and
$385 million and $880 million during the quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021.
We periodically experience performance issues and record losses for certain programs. For further discussion on the programs at
Aeronautics and RMS, see “Note 10 - Other” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating margin 10.4 % 8.6 % 10.5 % 9.7 %
Aeronautics’ net sales during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 decreased $804 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2021.
Net sales decreased by approximately $945 million for the F-35 program due to lower volume on production contracts as a result of supply
chain performance delays and delays in receiving additional contractual authorization and funding under the Lots 15-17 contract, and about
$50 million on the F-16 program due to lower volume on sustainment contracts and an unfavorable profit adjustment on a production contract
in the second quarter of 2022 as a result of manufacturing line ramp up delays, partially offset by higher volume on production contracts.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $210 million on classified contracts primarily due to higher volume.
Aeronautics’ operating profit during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 increased $40 million, or 7% compared to the same period in
2021. Operating profit increased approximately $220 million on classified contracts due to a $225 million loss in the second quarter of 2021
on a classified program; and approximately $40 million for the F-22 program due to higher net favorable profit adjustments. These increases
were partially offset by lower operating profit of approximately $145 million for the F-35 program due to lower volume on production contracts
as described above; and about $55 million for the F-16 program due to an unfavorable profit adjustment on a production contract in the
second quarter of 2022 as described above. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $120
million higher in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.
Aeronautics’ net sales during the six months ended June 26, 2022 decreased $790 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in
2021. Net sales decreased by approximately $1.0 billion for the F-35 program due to lower volume as described above and lower net
favorable profit adjustments on production contracts. This decrease was partially offset by increases of approximately $220 million on
classified contracts primarily due to higher volume; and about $30 million for the F-16 program due to higher volume on production contracts
that was partially offset by unfavorable profit adjustments on a production contract and a modernization contract.
Aeronautics’ operating profit during the six months ended June 26, 2022 increased $26 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in
2021. Operating profit increased approximately $240 million on classified contracts due to a $225 million loss in the second quarter of 2021
for a classified program for performance issues; and about $70 million for the F-22 program due to higher net favorable profit adjustments.
These increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of approximately $195 million for the F-35 program due to lower volume as
described above and lower net favorable profit adjustments on production contracts; and about $80 million for the F-16 program due to
unfavorable profit adjustments on a production contract and modernization contracts. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit
booking rate adjustments, were $95 million higher in the six months ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.

MFC’s net sales during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 decreased $197 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $155 million for sensors and global sustainment programs primarily
due to lower volume on SOF GLSS as a result of troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and lower net favorable profit adjustments due to close
out activities in the second quarter of 2021 related to the Warrior; and about $45 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to lower
volume (air dominance weapon systems).
MFC’s operating profit during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 increased $17 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2021.The
increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $40 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher
net favorable profit adjustments (Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), and
Hellfire); and about $10 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher net favorable profit adjustments (Patriot
Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3)). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $40 million for sensors and global sustainment
programs primarily due to lower net favorable profit adjustments as a result of the closeout of the Warrior program in 2021. In addition,
operating margin was positively impacted when compared to the second quarter of 2021 due to contract mix (lower SOF GLSS volume and
lower development volume for tactical and strike missiles). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments in
the second quarter of 2022 were comparable to the same period in 2021.
MFC’s net sales during the six months ended June 26, 2022 decreased $494 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $230 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to
lower volume on SOF GLSS as described above and lower volume and net favorable profit adjustments on Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod
(SNIPER®), partially offset by the net effect of favorable profit adjustments on an international program as a result of a requirements
modification in the first quarter of 2022 and the termination of the Warrior program in 2021; about $125 million for tactical and strike missile
programs due to lower volume (air dominance weapon systems and hypersonics); and approximately $105 million for integrated air and
missile defense programs due to lower volume (THAAD) and lower net favorable profit adjustments (PAC-3).
MFC’s operating profit during the six months ended June 26, 2022 was comparable to the same period in 2021. Operating profit
increased by approximately $30 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher net favorable profit adjustments (HIMARS,
GMLRS and JASSM); and about $10 million for sensors and global sustainment programs primarily due to the net effect of favorable profit
adjustments on an international program in the first quarter of 2022 and the termination of the Warrior program in 2021, partially offset by
lower net favorable profit adjustments (SNIPER). These increases were offset by approximately $35 million for integrated air and missile
defense programs due to volume (THAAD) and lower net favorable profit adjustments (PAC-3). In addition, operating margin was positively
impacted when compared to the six months ended June 27, 2021 due to contract mix (lower SOF GLSS volume and lower development
volume at tactical and strike missiles). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $20 million
higher in the six months ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.

RMS’ net sales during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 decreased $230 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $100 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower production
volume (Black Hawk); about $80 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs due to lower volume (Littoral Combat
Ship (LCS) and Advanced Hawkeye); and approximately $55 million for various C6ISR (command, control, communications, computers,
cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) programs due to lower volume.
RMS’ operating profit during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 decreased $55 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $20 million for IWSS programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments (Aegis and
ground-based radar), about $10 million for various C6ISR programs due to lower volume; and approximately $10 million for Sikorsky
helicopter programs due to lower production volume (Black Hawk). Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate
adjustments, were $25 million lower in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.
RMS’ net sales during the six months ended June 26, 2022 decreased $785 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $310 million for TLS programs primarily due to the delivery of an
international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021 that did not recur in 2022; about $230 million for IWSS programs due to lower
volume (LCS, TPQ-53 and Advanced Hawkeye); approximately $140 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower production volume
(Black Hawk); and about $105 million for various C6ISR programs due to lower volume.
RMS’ operating profit during the six months ended June 26, 2022 decreased $140 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2021.
The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $50 million for IWSS programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments (Aegis
and ground-based radar); $45 million for various C6ISR programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments and volume, and
approximately $25 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower production volume and net favorable profit adjustments (Black
Hawk), partially offset by higher net favorable profit adjustments and volume (CRH). Operating profit for TLS programs was comparable due
to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021 that did not recur in 2022, offset by higher net favorable
profit adjustments on various other programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $80

Space’s net sales during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 decreased $352 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2021. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $425 million due to the previously announced renationalization of the
AWE program on June 30, 2021, which was no longer included in our financial results beginning in the third quarter of 2021; and about $55
million for commercial civil space programs due to

lower volume (Orion). These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $130 million for strategic and missile defense
programs due to higher development volume (Next Generation Interceptor (NGI)).
Space’s operating profit during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 decreased $67 million, or 20%, compared to the same period in 2021.
The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $55 million for national security space programs primarily due to lower net favorable
profit adjustments (primarily Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and classified programs); and about $40 million of lower equity earnings
from our investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA). These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $30 million for
strategic and missile defense programs due to higher net favorable profit adjustments (primarily Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) programs).
Operating profit for the AWE program was comparable as its operating profit in the second quarter of 2021 was mostly offset by accelerated
amortization expense for intangible assets as a result of the renationalization. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking
rate adjustments, were $30 million lower in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.
Space’s net sales during the six months ended June 26, 2022 decreased $808 million, or 13%, compared to the same period in 2021.
The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $865 million due to the renationalization of the AWE program on
June 30, 2021, which was no longer included in our financial results beginning in the third quarter of 2021; and about $150 million for
commercial civil space programs due to lower volume (Orion and Human Lander System (HLS) programs). These decreases were partially
offset by higher net sales of about $230 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher development volume (NGI).
Space’s operating profit during the six months ended June 26, 2022 decreased $49 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2021.
The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $45 million for national security space programs primarily due to lower net favorable
profit adjustments (primarily SBIRS and classified programs); and about $35 million for commercial civil space programs due to lower net
favorable profit adjustments and lower volume (the Orion and HLS programs). These decreases were partially offset by an increase of
approximately $30 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher net favorable profit adjustments (primarily FBM
programs). Operating profit for the AWE program was comparable as its operating profit in the first six months of 2021 was mostly offset by
accelerated amortization expense for intangible assets as a result of the renationalization. Adjustments not related to volume, including net
profit booking rate adjustments, were $55 million lower in the six months ended June 26, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.
Total equity earnings (primarily ULA) represented approximately $5 million, or 2%, and $35 million, or 7%, of Space's operating profit
during the quarter and six months ended June 26, 2022, compared to approximately $45 million, or 13%, and $40 million, or 7% during the
quarter and six months ended June 27, 2021.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Cash Flows
At June 26, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operations.
However, we also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including our revolving credit facility
or the ability to issue commercial paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes
such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, our expected cash flow generated
from operations and our access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements and cash deployment plans over the next
twelve months and beyond based on our current business plans.
Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances from non-U.S. Government
customers in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash from operations. We generally do not begin work on contracts until
funding is appropriated by the customer. However, from time to time, we fund customer programs ourselves pending government
appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract or in advance of a contract award, this negatively affects our
cash flows and we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. For example, due to the prolonged negotiation of the F-35 Low
Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Lots 15-17 production contract, beginning in the second quarter our costs to continue production to meet our
customer’s desired aircraft delivery dates began to exceed the contract value and available funding which prevented us from invoicing and
41
Table of Contents
receiving cash of approximately $465 million for costs incurred in the second quarter of 2022. See “Other Matters” below and Item 1A, Risk
Factors, for additional information.
Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill
and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represented approximately 39% of the sales we recorded during
the six months ended June 26, 2022, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may
provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amount of performance-
based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ
from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.
The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-
price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment
provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly as
costs are incurred. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government changes its payment policies or decides to withhold payments on
our billings. While the impact of policy changes or withholding payments may delay the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash
collected during the life of the contract should not vary.
To date, the effects of COVID-19 have resulted in some negative impacts on our cash flows, partially due to supplier delays. The U.S.
Government has taken certain actions and enacted legislation to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on public health, the economy, state and
local governments, individuals, and businesses. Since the pandemic began, Lockheed Martin has remained committed to accelerating
payments to the supply chain with a focus on small and at risk businesses. As of June 26, 2022, we have accelerated $1.0 billion of
payments to our suppliers that are due by their terms in future periods. We will continue to monitor risk driven by the pandemic and, based on
our current assessment, we will continue to accelerate payments to our suppliers based on risk assessed need through the end of 2022.
In addition, we have a balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our customers with
enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise.
Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and technologies through capital expenditures, independent
research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments. We have returned cash to stockholders through dividends
and share repurchases. Our total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $1.6 billion at
June 26, 2022.
We also continue to actively manage our debt levels, including maturities and interest rates, as evidenced by the debt transaction in the
second quarter of 2022 and our pension obligations. We expect to continue to opportunistically manage our pension liabilities through the
purchase of group annuity contracts for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust as
we did on June 24, 2022. See “Note 6 - Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information. Future pension risk transfer transactions could also be significant and result in us making additional contributions to
the pension trust and/or require us to recognize noncash, non-operating pension settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting
period.
There were no material changes during the quarter or six months ended June 26, 2022 to our contractual commitments as presented in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our 2021 Form 10-K that were outside the
ordinary course of our business.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 26, 2022 decreased $275 million compared to the same
period in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to cash impacts for the lack of additional contractual authorization and funding from the U.S.
Government prior to the end of the second quarter of 2022 on the Lots 15-17 contract of the F-35 program.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Our capital
expenditures are comprised of equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the development or
purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized). We use free cash flow to evaluate our business performance and overall liquidity, as
well as a performance goal in our annual and long-term incentive plans. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because
it represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to
stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchase and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions. The entire amount of
free cash flow is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not account for certain mandatory
expenditures, such as the repayment of maturing debt. While management believes that free cash flow as a non-GAAP financial measure
may be useful in evaluating our financial performance, it should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information
prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities during the six months ended June 26, 2022 increased $194 million compared to the same period
in 2021. The increase in cash used for investing activities is due to the receipt of $231 million in the first six months of 2021 from the sale of
our ownership interest in the Advanced Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center (AMMROC) joint venture. Capital expenditures
totaled $572 million and $599 million during the six months ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021. The majority of our capital expenditures
were for equipment and
43

facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur
capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of
costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.
Financing Activities
Net cash used for financing activities was $4.0 billion during the six months ended June 26, 2022, compared to $3.0 billion during the
same period in 2021. 
During the six months ended June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021, we paid dividends totaling $1.5 billion ($5.60 per share) and $1.5 billion
($5.20 per share).
During the six months ended June 26, 2022, we paid $2.4 billion to repurchase 7.7 million shares of our common stock, some of which
were settled subsequent to the end of the second quarter. See “Note 9 - Stockholders’ Equity” included in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information. During the six months ended June 27, 2021, we paid $1.5 billion to repurchase 4.2 million
shares of our common stock.
During the quarter ended June 26, 2022, we received net proceeds of $2.3 billion from issuance of senior unsecured notes and used
the net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of the outstanding $500 million Notes due 2023, $750 million Notes due 2025 and used the
remaining balance of the net proceeds to redeem $1.0 billion of our outstanding $2.0 billion Notes due 2026. See “Note 10 - Other” included

At June 26, 2022, we held cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion that was generally available to fund ordinary business operations
without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.
At June 26, 2022, we had a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) with various banks with an expiration date
of August 24, 2026 that is available for general corporate purposes including supporting commercial paper borrowings. We may request and
the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of up to an additional
$500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at June 26, 2022.
We have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. The outstanding balance of
commercial paper can fluctuate daily and the amount outstanding during the period may be greater than or less than the amount reported at
the end of the period. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of June 26, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We may, as
conditions warrant, from time to time issue commercial paper backed by our Revolving Credit Facility to manage the timing of cash flows.
However, depending on market conditions, commercial paper may not be available on favorable terms or at all.
Our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs was $11.6 billion as of June 26, 2022 and is in the form of
publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. The outstanding debt at June 26, 2022 is inclusive of the second quarter 2022 issuance
of $2.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and redemption of outstanding $500 million in aggregate principal
amount of our 3.10% Notes due 2023, $750 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.90% Notes due 2025, and $1.0 billion of our
outstanding $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 3.55% Notes due 2026 at their redemption price.
For further discussion on the outstanding debt at June 26, 2022, see “Note 10 - Other” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. As of June 26, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.

OTHER MATTERS
Status of the F-35 Program
The F-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. Production of the
aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air
Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and seven Foreign Military Sales
(FMS) customers; as well as interest from other countries. During the first quarter of 2022, Finland became the seventh FMS customer to join
the program, and Germany announced its intention to purchase 35 F-35 aircraft. On March 28, 2022, the Government of Canada selected
the F-35 as the preferred bidder to move into the Finalization Phase of the competitive process to replace their fighter fleet. In the Finalization
Phase, they will collaborate with the F-35 team to deliver unique requirements and a delivery profile before moving forward with contracting
with the U.S. Government for the procurement of 88 aircraft.
We recently reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Government on the F-35 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Lots 15-17
production contract and we continue to engage with the U.S. Government to definitize the contract. We have been performing work on the
Lots 15-17 production under customer authorization and initial funding to begin work under an advance acquisition contract received in
December 2019. Our costs began to exceed the contract value and available funding on the Lots 15-17 advance acquisition contract in the
second quarter of 2022. As a result, this prevented the recognition of approximately $325 million of sales and associated operating profit in
the second quarter. Additionally, it prevented us from invoicing and receiving cash of approximately $465 million for costs incurred in the
second quarter of 2022. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, we also had approximately $1 billion in potential termination liability
exposure to third parties related to LRIP Lots 15-17. We expect to recover the unrecognized sales and resume invoicing costs incurred upon
receiving contractual authorization and funding on the production contract with the U.S. Government, which we expect to occur in the third
quarter of 2022. However, until a final agreement is reached or the U.S. Government otherwise provides additional contractual authorization
and funding, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition will continue to be negatively impacted and the impacts could be
material.
During the second quarter of 2022, we encountered supplier delays due to COVID-19 that negatively impacted F-35 net sales and
operating profit in the second quarter due to lower volume and we expect the timing of F-35 net sales and operating profit will continue to be
impacted in future periods. We are working closely with our supply base to develop plans that minimize the impacts to the F-35 partners and
FMS customers, however, as a result we now expect a flat delivery profile in 2023. Additionally, as part of the Lots 15-17 production contract,
the U.S. Government reduced the acquisition quantities based on budget availability. While we expect the LRIP Lots 15-17 contract to
support our long-term objective to produce 156 aircraft a year, COVID-19 and other impacts experienced by the F-35 enterprise have
required us to modify our near-term production plan. Deliveries are expected to remain in the range of 147-153 aircraft per year in 2023 and
2024, before we achieve our 156 aircraft delivery target in 2025. We continue to anticipate annual deliveries of 156 aircraft beyond 2025 for
the foreseeable future.
During the second quarter of 2022, we delivered 35 production aircraft to our U.S. and international partner countries, and FMS
customers, resulting in total deliveries of 814 production aircraft. We have 169 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our
international partner customers and countries.
We successfully negotiated a new four-year contract with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers covering
approximately 5,000 represented employees that primarily work on F-35 production in Fort Worth, Texas in the second quarter of 2022.
Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance,
program schedule, delivery schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international countries’ oversight, and
budgeting processes. In addition to the contract negotiation and funding challenges described above, current program challenges include
supplier, Lockheed Martin and partner performance (including COVID-19 performance-related challenges), software development, execution
of future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life cycle operations,
sustainment and potential contractual obligations, inflation-related cost pressures, and the ability to continue to reduce the unit production
costs and improve affordability.

Critical Accounting Policies
There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2021 Form 10-K, except for, as set forth below, updated defined benefit pension plan
disclosures to reflect the impact of the purchase of group annuity contracts on June 24, 2022.
Postretirement Benefit Plans
Overview
On June 24, 2022, we purchased group annuity contracts to transfer $4.3 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and
related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 13,600 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The group annuity contracts were
purchased using assets from Lockheed Martin’s master retirement trust and no additional funding contribution was required. In connection
with this transaction, we recognized a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share,
after-tax) for the affected defined benefit pension plans (the Affected Plans) in the quarter ended June 26, 2022, which represents the
accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss account within stockholders’
equity.
As a result of this transaction, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations and assets related to the Affected Plans as of the
June 24, 2022 close date (the Remeasurement Date). The remeasurement reflects the use of an updated discount rate and actual return on
plan assets described in further detail below. For more information on the transaction and remeasurement, see “Note 6 - Postretirement
Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Actuarial Assumptions
The benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon
the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured
using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets, participant longevity, and employee turnover. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the
measurement date and the calculation of FAS pension (expense) income in subsequent periods.
As described above, we remeasured the benefit obligations and assets related to the Affected Plans as of the June 24, 2022 close
date. When calculating the benefit obligations related to the Affected Plans, we utilized a discount rate of 4.75% as of the Remeasurement
Date, compared to 2.875% as of December 31, 2021. The increase in the discount rate resulted in a decrease of approximately $7.9 billion in
the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate we select is based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25
basis points in the 4.75% discount rate assumption used in the remeasurement for the Affected Plans would have decreased or increased
the amount of the benefit obligation we recorded by approximately $0.8 billion, with an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity
of approximately $0.6 billion.
The actual return on plan assets for the period January 1, 2022 through the June 24, 2022 remeasurement date for the Affected Plans
was approximately (16)%, or $(4.7) billion, which was approximately $5.7 billion lower (the incremental loss) than our expected return on plan
assets of approximately 3.25% for the period, or $1.0 billion (the proportional effect, or approximately half of our expected 6.50% annual
long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption), for the period. The incremental loss of $5.7 billion on plan assets was recognized in the
remeasurement of the assets related to the Affected Plans.
The plan remeasurements resulted in a decrease of $2.2 billion to our net unfunded pension obligations (which includes the change in
benefit obligation primarily related to the higher discount rate utilized in the remeasurement of $7.9 billion and the incremental loss on plan
assets recognized in remeasurement of $5.7 billion) with a corresponding increase of $1.7 billion after taxes in stockholders’ equity. The
change in stockholders’ equity reflects the decrease in deferred
46
Table of Contents
actuarial losses, which will be recognized as an increase in net FAS pension income (or a decrease in net FAS pension expense) over the
estimated remaining life expectancy of the covered employees beginning in the third quarter of 2022. However, deferred net actuarial gains
or losses in stockholders’ equity are adjusted annually when the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans are measured, which will
result in additional changes to our FAS pension income or expense in future periods.
Funding Considerations
The required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, along with consideration of CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules.
Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S.
Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our pension
costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur
in different periods from when pension contributions are made in accordance with ERISA.
We made no contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans during the quarters and six months ended June 26, 2022.
Trends
We now expect FAS pension expense of approximately $1.1 billion in 2022, inclusive of the noncash, non-operating pension settlement
charge of $1.5 billion (pretax) described above. Excluding the noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge, our expected FAS pension
income will be approximately $410 million in 2022, which is $50 million lower than our prior 2022 FAS pension income estimate of $460
million.
Our 2022 CAS cost was not impacted by the purchase of the group annuity contracts or the remeasurement of the benefit pension
obligations and related assets related to the Affected Plans described above. Therefore, we continue to expect our CAS pension cost will be
approximately $1.8 billion in 2022, which is consistent with our prior 2022 CAS pension cost estimate.
We now expect a total FAS/CAS pension adjustment of approximately $740 million in 2022, inclusive of the noncash, non-operating
pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion (pretax) described above, compared to our prior estimate of $2.3 billion in 2022. Excluding the
noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge, our expected total FAS/CAS pension adjustment will be approximately $2.2 billion in
2022, which is $50 million lower than our prior 2022 estimate.
We do not plan to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2022.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The carrying value of our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at June 26, 2022, including $2.7 billion of goodwill at our Sikorsky reporting
unit. The carrying value of our Sikorsky reporting unit also included an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset of $887 million as of June
26, 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset,
and the results of that test indicated no impairment existed. As of the date of our 2021 annual impairment test, we estimated that the fair
value of our Sikorsky reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for goodwill by a margin of approximately 30% and the fair value of the
intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 15%. We will perform our next annual goodwill and intangible asset
impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2022 and will perform a quantitative assessment of the fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit.
The fair values of our goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at our Sikorsky reporting unit can be significantly
impacted by its performance, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, contract terminations, changes in expected future orders,
general market pressures, including U.S. Government budgetary constraints, discount rates, long term growth rates, and changes in U.S.
(federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, along with
other significant judgments. Based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill and indefinite-lived
trademark intangible asset at

our Sikorsky reporting unit are at risk for impairment should there be a deterioration of projected cash flows of the reporting unit.
We do not currently anticipate any material impairments on our assets as a result of COVID-19 or inflation. See Item 1A, Risk Factors
of our 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on the fair value of our assets.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See “Note 11 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related
to new accounting standards.
ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
As disclosed in “Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our 2021 Form 10-K, we transact business
globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as
forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our exposures to market risk have not
changed materially since December 31, 2021. See “Note 8 - Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional discussion.
ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures
We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 26, 2022. The evaluation was
performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key corporate functions, under the supervision of the
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were operating and effective as of June 26, 2022.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 26, 2022 that materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings
We are a party to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising under
provisions relating to the protection of the environment, and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned.
These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-
monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters will have a material adverse
effect on the corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net
earnings and cash flows in any particular interim reporting period. We cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty.
These matters include the proceedings summarized in “Note 7 - Legal Proceedings and Contingencies” included in our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and “Note 15 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements for the protection of the environment, including those for discharge of
hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to the complexity and pervasiveness of these requirements, we are a
party to or have property subject to various lawsuits, proceedings and remediation obligations. The extent of our financial exposure cannot in
all cases be reasonably estimated at this time. For information regarding the matters discussed above, including current estimates of the
amounts that we believe are required for remediation or clean-up to the extent estimable, see “Note 7 - Legal Proceedings and
Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also “Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental Matters”
in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 15 – Legal Proceedings,
Commitments and Contingencies”, each in our 2021 Form 10-K, for a description of previously reported matters.
As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to various audits and investigations by the U.S. Government to determine whether our
operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. U.S. Government investigations of us, whether
relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including
repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, suspension, proposed debarment, debarment from eligibility for future U.S.
Government contracting or suspension of export privileges. Suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of
our dependence on contracts with the U.S. Government. U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no
adverse action against us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., which are subject to U.S. and foreign
laws and regulations and foreign procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with local regulations or applicable U.S. Government
regulations also may be audited or investigated.
ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
Except for the risk factors discussed below, we do not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in
“Item 1A, Risk Factors” of our 2021 Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties described in our risk factors have the potential to materially
affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, projected results and future prospects. These risks are not exclusive
and additional risks to which we are subject include the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” and the risks described in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The F-35 program comprises a material portion of our revenue and reductions or delays in funding for this program and risks
related to the development, production, sustainment, performance, schedule, cost, and requirements of the program could
adversely affect our performance.
The F-35 program, which consists of multiple development, production, and sustainment contracts, is our largest program and
represented 27% and 26% of our total consolidated net sales in 2021 and the first six months of 2022. A decision by the U.S. Government or
other governments to cut or delay spending on this program or reduce or delay planned orders would have an adverse impact on our
business and results of operations. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews
related to aircraft performance, program schedule, delivery schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and
international countries’ oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include supplier, Lockheed Martin and partner
performance (including COVID-19 performance-related challenges), software development, definitizing and receiving funding for contracts on
a
50

timely basis (as described below), execution of future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost
associated with life cycle operations, sustainment and potential contractual obligations, inflation related cost pressures, and the ability to
continue to reduce the unit production costs and improve affordability.
We recently reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Government on the F-35 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Lots 15-17
production contract and we continue to engage with the U.S. Government to definitize the contract. We have been performing work on the
Lots 15-17 production under customer authorization and initial funding to begin work under an advance acquisition contract received in
December 2019. Our costs began to exceed the contract value and available funding on the Lots 15-17 advance acquisition contract in the
second quarter of 2022. As a result, this prevented the recognition of approximately $325 million of sales and associated operating profit in
the second quarter. Additionally, it prevented us from invoicing and receiving cash of approximately $465 million for costs incurred in the
second quarter of 2022. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, we also had approximately $1 billion in potential termination liability
exposure to third parties related to LRIP Lots 15-17. We expect to recover the unrecognized sales and resume invoicing costs incurred upon
receiving contractual authorization and funding on the production contract with the U.S. Government, which we expect to occur in the third
quarter of 2022. However, there can be no assurance that the existing agreement in principle will be converted to a definitive contract in a
timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Until a final agreement is reached or the U.S. Government otherwise provides additional
contractual authorization and funding, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition will continue to be negatively impacted
and the impacts could be material.
Our planned production rates and deliveries have been affected and could continue to be affected by COVID-19 or supplier delays
which affect our results of operations. During the second quarter of 2022, we encountered supplier delays due to COVID-19 that negatively
impacted F-35 net sales and operating profit in the second quarter due to lower volume and we expect the timing of F-35 net sales and
operating profit will continue to be impacted in future periods. We are working closely with our supply base to develop plans that minimize the
impacts to the F-35 partners and FMS customers, however, as a result we now expect a flat delivery profile in 2023. Although we expect
deliveries to be in the range of 147-153 aircraft per year in 2023 and 2024 with a target of 156 deliveries in 2025 and beyond, this delivery
profile is subject to risks, including additional supplier delays or budget constraints. If we were unable to achieve our expected delivery
profile, our results of operations could be negatively affected.
We also may not be successful in making hardware and software upgrades and other modernization capabilities in a timely manner,
including as a result of dependencies on suppliers, which could increase costs and create schedule delays. Our ability to capture and retain
future F-35 growth in development, production and sustainment is dependent on the success of our efforts to achieve F-35 sustainment
performance, customer affordability, supply chain improvements, continued reliability improvements and other efficiencies, some of which are
outside our control.

In October 2010, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock
in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market at prices per share not exceeding the then-current market prices. From time to time, our
Board of Directors authorizes increases to our share repurchase program. The total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases
under our share repurchase program was $1.6 billion as of June 26, 2022. Under the program, management has discretion to determine the dollar
amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation. This includes purchases
pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, including accelerated share repurchases. The program does not have an expiration date.
During the first quarter of 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $2.0 billion of our common stock
that settled in the second quarter of 2022. Under the terms of the ASR agreement, we paid $2.0 billion and received an initial delivery of 4,130,738
shares of our common stock in February 2022. Upon final settlement of the ASR agreement in April 2022, we received an additional 550,270 shares of
our common stock for no additional consideration. The average price paid per share under the ASR agreement was $427.26, calculated with reference
to the volume-weighted average price (VW AP) of our common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. A verage Price Paid
Per Share in the table above does not include ASR shares.
During the quarter ended June 26, 2022, the total number of shares purchased included 1,508 shares that were transferred to us by employees in
satisfaction of tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of restricted stock units. These purchases were made pursuant to a separate
authorization by our Board of Directors and are not included within the program.(b)
