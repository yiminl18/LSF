Our
 principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is thelargest
 seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet websites (which we refer tocollective
ly as our “Direct to Consumer” or “DTC” operations), and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world. Virtually all of our products aremanufactured
 by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both inthe United States and abroad.
Products
 
We
 focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in nine key categories: Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Men’s Training, Women’s Training, ActionSports,
 Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products) and Golf. Men's Training includes our baseball and American football product offerings. We also market productsdesigned for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket, lacrosse, tennis, volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activities.
NIKE’s athletic footwea
r products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We placeconsiderable
 emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in our products. Sportswear, Running, the Jordan Brand and Football (Soccer) are currently our top-sellingfootwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales.
We
 also  sell  sports  apparel  covering  the  above-mentioned  categories,  which  feature  the  same  trademarks  and  are  sold  predominantly  through  the  same  marketing  anddistribution
 channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment toinnovation
 and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Men's Training, Running, Football (Soccer) and Women's Training are currently our top-selling apparel categories, andwe
 expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category. We also market apparelwith licensed college and professional team and league logos.
We
 sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves,protective
 equipment, golf clubs and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through ourwholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc.
Our Jordan
 Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark.Sales and operating results for the Jordan Brand are reported as a separate category and within the NIK
E Brand geographic operating segments, respectively.One
 of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel andaccessories
 under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley are included within the NIKE Brand Action Sports category and within the NIKE Brand's NorthAmerica geographic operating segment, respectively.
Another
 of  our  wholly-owned  subsidiary  brands,  Converse,  headquartered  in  Boston,  Massachusetts,  designs,  distributes  and  licenses  casual  sneakers,  apparel  andaccessories
 under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on astand-alone basis.
In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our DTC operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit
unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.

Financial
 information  about  geographic  and  segment  operations  appears  in Note  17  —  Operating  Segments  and  Related  Information of  the  accompanying  Notes  to  theConsolidated Financial Statements.
We experience
 moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in thesecond
 and  third  quarters.  However,  the  mix  of  product  sales  may  vary  considerably  as  a  result  of  changes  in  seasonal  and  geographic  demand  for  particular  types  offootwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors.
Because
 NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products.We
 must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categoriesand
 influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on oursales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We
 report  our  NIKE  Brand  operations  based  on  our  internal  geographic  organization.  Each  NIKE  Brand  geography  operates  predominantly  in  one  industry:  the  design,development,
 marketing  and  selling  of athletic  footwear,  apparel,  equipment,  accessories  and  services.  Our reportable  operating  segments  for the  NIKE  Brand  are:  NorthAmerica,
 Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within eachgeographic operating segment.
Converse is also a reportable segment and operates in
 one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse Directto Consumer operations, including e-commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results.
United States Market
For 
fiscal 2016 ,  NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 47% of  total revenues, compared to 46% for  both fiscal  2015 and fiscal2014 
.  We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sportinggoods
 stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicitsales
 as  well  as  independent  sales  representatives  to  sell  specialty  products  for  golf  and  skateboarding.  During fiscal  2016 ,  our  three  largest  customers  accounted  forapproximately 
25% of sales in the United States. We
 make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will bedelivered
 within a set time period at a fixed price. In fiscal  2016 , 84% of  our U.S. wholesale footwear shipments were made under the futures program, compared to 87% in fiscal 2015 
and 86% in fiscal 2014 . In fiscal 2016 , 66% of  our U.S. wholesale apparel shipments were made under the futures program, compared to 67% in fiscal 2015 and 71% 
in fiscal 2014 . Our Direct to
 Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse products to consumers through our e-commerce website, www.nike.com . In addition, our Direct to Consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States:
U.S. Retail Stores

196 NIKE Brand in-line stores, including employee-only stores
34 Converse stores (including factory stores)
103 Hurley stores (including factory and employee stores)
29 TOTAL
362 In
 the United States, NIKE has five significant distribution centers located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and three are leased. NIKE Brand apparel andequipment products are
 also shipped from our leased Foothill Ranch, California distribution center. Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from leased facilities inOntario, California. Smaller leased distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States.
International Markets
For 
fiscal 2016 , non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for 53% of total revenues, compared to 54% for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 . We sell our products to retail accounts, through ou
r own Direct to Consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell tothousands
 of retail accounts and ship products from 42 distribution centers outside of the United States. In many countries and regions, including Canada, Asia, some LatinAmerican
 countries and Europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above. During fiscal  2016 , NIKE’s three largest customers outside of the United States accounted
 for approximately 13% of total non-U.S. sales. In
 addition to NIKE and Converse owned e-commerce websites in over 40 countries, our Direct to Consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outsidethe United States:

Significant Customer
No 
customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net revenues during fiscal 2016 . Orders
Worldwide
 futures orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2016, were $14.9 billion compared with $13.8billion
 for the same period last year. NIKE Brand reported futures include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores ande-commerce
 operations  which  are  reflected  at  prices  that  are  comparable  to  prices  charged  to  external  wholesale  customers.  The  U.S.  Dollar  futures  orders  amount  iscalculated
 based upon our internal forecast of the actual currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Reported futures orders arenot
 necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment ofcertain
 of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels oforder
 cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is notderived
 from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail salesand internal orders from our Direct to Consumer in-line stores and e-commerce operations, and sales from our Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf businesses.
Product Research, Design and Development
We
 believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, appareland
 athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort whilereducing waste.
In
 addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we alsoutilize
 research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with usand
 review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employeeathletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate
 products during the design and development process.As
 we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our productcategories. Using market
 intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumerpreferences. The proliferati
on of NIKE Air, Lunar, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave and NIKE+ technologies through Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand,Football (Soccer), Men's Training, Women's Training and Sportswear, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.
Manufacturing
We
 are supplied by approximately 142 footwear factories located in 15 countries. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 7% of total fiscal 2016 NIKE Brand
 footwear  production.  Virtually  all  of  our  footwear  is  manufactured  outside  of  the  United  States  by  independent  contract  manufacturers  who  often  operate  multiplefactories.
 In fiscal  2016 ,  contract factories in Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 44%, 29% and 21% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. Wealso
 have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina, India, Brazil and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. Infiscal
 2016 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of  NIKEBrand footwear production.
We
 are supplied by approximately 394 apparel factories located in 39 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 12% of  total fiscal  2016 NIKE Brand
 apparel  production.  Virtually  all  of  our  apparel  is  manufactured  outside  of  the  United  States  by  independent  contract  manufacturers  which  often  operate  multiplefactories.
 In fiscal  2016 ,  contract factories in China, Vietnam and Indonesia produced approximately 26%, 23% and 9% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. In fiscal 2016 
, one apparel  contract  manufacturer  accounted  for  more  than  10%  of  apparel  production,  and  the  top  five  contract  manufacturers  in  aggregate  accounted  forapproximately 
39% of NIKE Brand apparel production. The
 principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon,polyester
 and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal  2016 ,  NIKE IHM, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary ofNIKE,
 Inc., with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam, were our largest suppliers of the Air-Sole
 cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled);specialized
 performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKE’sindependent
 contractors  and  suppliers  buy  raw  materials  for  the  manufacturing  of  our  footwear,  apparel  and  equipment  products.  Most  raw  materials  are  available  andpurchased
 by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contract manufacturers and suppliers havethus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products.

Table of ContentsSince
 1972,  Sojitz  Corporation  of  America  (“Sojitz  America”),  a  large  Japanese  trading  company  and  the  sole  owner  of  our  redeemable  preferred  stock,  has  performedsignificant
 import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2016 ,  Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKEmarkets including Argentina, Urug
uay, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 6% of NIKEBrand
 sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquireproducts
 from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales andprofitability.
 However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates.Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31, 2018 and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to May 31, 2019.
International Operations and Trade
Our
 international  operations  and  sources  of  supply  are  subject  to  the  usual  risks  of  doing  business  abroad,  such  as  possible  increases  in  import  duties,  anti-dumpingmeasures,
 quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not,to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot
 predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future.In
 recent years, uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world. These trendsare affecting
 many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing tradeprotectionism
 in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry,while
 observing  applicable  competition  laws.  Notwithstanding  our  efforts,  protectionist  measures  have  resulted  in  increases  in  the  cost  of  our  products,  and  additionalmeasures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.
We
 monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes tomitigate trade
 restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for andadvocating
 against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. Moreover, with respect to trade restrictionstargeting
 China,  which  represents  an  important  sourcing  country  and  consumer  market  for  us,  we  are  working  with  a  broad  coalition  of  global  businesses  and  tradeassociations
 representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistentwith international trade rules, and (iii) reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community.
Where
 trade  protection  measures  are  implemented,  we  believe  that  we  have  the  ability  to  develop,  over  a  period  of  time,  adequate  alternative  sources  of  supply  for  theproducts
 obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarilydisrupted
 and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supplywould, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be
 as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.NIKE
 advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), if ultimatelyratified, has the potential to reduce or
 eliminate high rates of customs duties for imports into the United States of NIKE products sourced from TPP countries (primarily footwearand
 apparel from Vietnam and apparel from Malaysia). Similarly, the European Union has concluded a free trade agreement with Vietnam that, if approved, could lead to dutyreduction or elimination for footwear and apparel.
Competition
The
 athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisurefootwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel
and
 equipment,  including  adidas,  ASICS,  Li  Ning,  lululemon  athletica,  Puma,  V.F.  Corporation  and  Under  Armour,  among  others.  The  intense  competition  and  the  rapidchanges
 in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in ouroperations.
NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment in the world. Important aspects o
f competition in this industry are:•
Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value. •
Consumer  connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction;  customer support and service;identification
 with  prominent  and  influential  athletes,  coaches,  teams,  colleges  and  sports  leagues  who  endorse  our  brands  and  use  our  products  and  activeengagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics.
•
Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and online. We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.
Trademarks and Patents
We
 utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, inidentifying
 our brands and the Company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among ourmost
 valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketingour products. We
 own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademarkregistrations.
We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. When appropriate, we have sought registrations for this content.
We own patents and have a patent license, facilitating our use of “Air” technologies.

Table of ContentsWe
 also file and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility patents, as well as many U.S. and foreign design patents protecting components, manufacturing techniques, featuresand
 industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, athletic equipment, digital devices and golf products. These patents expire at various times;patents issued for original applications filed this calendar year in the United States may last until 2031 for design patents and un
til 2036 for utility patents.We
 believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patentand
 trade  secret  positions.  However,  we  have  followed  a  policy  of  filing  patent  applications  for  the  United  States  and  select  foreign  countries  on  inventions,  designs  andimprovements that we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against third-party infringement.
Employees
As
 of May  31, 2016 ,  we had approximately 70,700 employees  worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management considers its relationship with employees tobe
 excellent. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography, where local law requires those employeesto
 be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitledto
 information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter intoand/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.

 “will  likely  result”  or  words  or  phrases  of  similar  meaning.  Forward-looking  statements  involve  risks  and  uncertainties  which  may  cause  actual  results  to  differmateriall
y from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms8-K,
 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overallathletic
 footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment forconsumers
 and  endorsers;  demographic  changes;  changes  in  consumer  preferences;  popularity  of  particular  designs,  categories  of  products  and  sports;  seasonal  andgeographic dem
and for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the various marketfactors
 described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKE’s increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, thesystems
 related to demand and supply planning  and inventory control;  interruptions  in data and information  technology  systems;  consumer  data security;  fluctuations  anddifficulty
 in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipmenttiming,
 the  changing  mix  of  futures  and  at-once  orders,  and  discounts,  order  cancellations  and  returns;  the  ability  of  NIKE  to  sustain,  manage  or  forecast  its  growth  andinventories;
 the  size,  timing  and  mix  of  purchases  of  NIKE’s  products;  increases  in  the  cost  of  materials,  labor  and  energy  used  to  manufacture  products;  new  productdevelopment and introduction; the
 ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adversepublicity;
 the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meetdelivery
 deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in NIKE's debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated withdoing
 business outside the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism;changes
 in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change, natural disasters, liability and other claims assertedagainst NIKE;
 the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the effects of NIKE's decision to invest in or divest of businesses and other factors referenced or incorporatedby reference in this report and other reports.
The risks included here ar
e not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE’s business and financial performance.Moreover, NIKE operates
 in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all suchrisks, nor can
 it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKE’s business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially fromthose
 contained  in  any  forward-looking  statements.  Given  these  risks  and  uncertainties,  investors  should  not  place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking  statements  as  aprediction of actual results.
Investors
 should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE’s policy to disclose to them any material non-public
 information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by anyanalyst
 irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others.Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts con
tain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.Our products face intense competition.
NIKE
 is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. Theathletic footwear, appar
el and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athleticand
 leisure  footwear  companies,  athletic  and leisure  apparel  companies,  sports  equipment  companies  and large companies  having  diversified  lines of  athletic  and leisurefootwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers tha
t produce our products.Product
 offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service and socialmedia
 presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwearand
 apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costsmay increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly.
Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business.
Our
 iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting andgrowing
 our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitmentto
 product  innovation  and  quality  and  our  continuing  investment  in  design  (including  materials)  and  marketing  may  not  have  the  desired  impact  on  our  brand  image  andreputation.
 We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negativepublicity.
 In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence inus and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations.
In
 addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including ourincreasing
 reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriouslydamage our
 reputation and brand image. If we do not maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations couldbe materially and adversely affected.

Table of ContentsIf
 we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenuesand profits.
Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate,
 gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner.However,
 lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of ourproducts
 are  subject  to  changing  consumer  preferences  that  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  Our  new  products  may  not  receive  consumer  acceptance  as  consumerpreferences could shift rapidly to
 different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our abilityto anticipate and respond
 to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing productofferings,
 developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lowersales,
 excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market ourproducts
 globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and online advertising. If we do not successfullymarket our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business,
 financial condition and results of operations.We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our
 products.Technical
 innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of ourproducts.
 Research  and  development  plays  a  key  role  in  technical  innovation.  We  rely  upon  specialists  in  the  fields  of  biomechanics,  chemistry,  exercise  physiology,engineering,
 industrial  design,  sustainability  and  related  fields,  as  well  as  research  committees  and  advisory  boards  made  up  of  athletes,  coaches,  trainers,  equipmentmanagers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts
 to develop and test cutting edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athleticperformance,
 reduce injury and maximize comfort,  if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products,  consumer demand for our products could decline, and if weexperience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems.
Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-qual
ity endorsers of our products could harm our business.We
 establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity withconsumers. 
However,  as  competition  in  our  industry  has  increased,  the  costs  associated  with  establishing  and  retaining  such  sponsorships  and  other  relationships  haveincreased.
 If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field
 authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues,expenses and profitability could be harmed.
Furthermore,
 if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actionstaken by athletes, teams or leagues assoc
iated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, could also seriously harm our brand image withconsumers and,
 as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctlyidentify promising athletes to
 use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizationscould adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.
A
 majority  of  our  products  are  manufactured  and  sold  outside  of  the  United  States.  As  a  result,  we  conduct  purchase  and  sale  transactions  in  various  currencies,  whichincreases
 our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange ratesas
 a result of the United Kingdom's June 23, 2016 referendum in which voters approved the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit.”Our
 international  revenues  and  expenses  generally  are  derived  from  sales  and  operations  in  foreign  currencies,  and  these  revenues  and  expenses  could  be  affected  bycurrency
 fluctuations,  specifically  amounts  recorded  in  foreign  currencies  and  translated  into  U.S.  Dollars  for  consolidated  financial  reporting,  as  weakening  of  foreigncurrencies
 relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange ratefluctuations could
 also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and moredifficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have
 an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We
 may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results.Since
 the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reducethe
 positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to theforeign curren
cies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.8

Table of ContentsGlobal economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
The
 uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economicand
 financial  market  conditions  do  not  improve  or  deteriorate,  the  following  factors  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  operating  results  and  financialcondition:
•
Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higherdiscounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins.
•
In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.•
We  conduct  transactions  in  various  currencies,  which  increases  our  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  relative  to  the  U.S.  Dollar.  Continuedvolatility in
 the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results andfinancial condition.
•
Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives)could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability.
•
If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this couldresult
 in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greaterexpense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.
•
If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of ourproducts to consumers.
•
If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase rawmaterials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.
Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.
We experience
 moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in thesecond
 and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand forparticular types
 of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, including without limitation the Olympics and the Europeanfootball
 championship. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, wemay
 not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, alongwith
 other  factors  that  are beyond  our  control,  including  general  economic  conditions,  changes  in consumer  preferences,  weather  conditions,  availability  of import  quotas,transportation
 disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating marginsare
 also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographicsales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of 
the results to be expected for any future period.Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues.
We
 make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will bedelivered wit
hin a set period of time at a fixed price. Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the timenecessary
 to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. Although we believe futures orders are animportant
 indicator of our future revenues, reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for any future period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside o
f the schedulenoted
 above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in thecomparisons
 between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKEBrand
 footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our Direct to Consumer in-line stores and e-commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley.
Our
 futures  ordering  program  does  not  prevent  excess  inventories  or  inventory  shortages,  which  could  result  in  decreased  operatingmargins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business.
We
 purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers.There is
 a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, andthe
 sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cashflows.
 Conversely,  if  we  underestimate  consumer  demand  for  our  products  or  if  our  manufacturers  fail  to  supply  products  we  require  at  the  time  we  need  them,  we  mayexperience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty.
The
 difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure toaccurately
 predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certaintyin advance.

Table of ContentsWe may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.
We
 extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of productionand
 the shipping of seasonal products, we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advanceorders
 may be canceled, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past,some
 customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivablesand
 our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect thefinancial
 health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent inpart
 on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experiencefinancial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.
Consolidation
 of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk andimpair our ability to sell products.
The
 athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with manystores.
 These retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additionalstores.
 These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, it wouldincrease
 the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular countryor region
 increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets forour products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues.
Our Direct
 to Consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources andare subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.
Our
 Direct to Consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We haveentered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness
and
 marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the highfixed-cost
 structure associated with our Direct to Consumer operations, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result insignificant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.
Many factors
 unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company’s control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud;mismanagement
 of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions inthe areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business.
If
 the  technology-based  systems  that  give  our  customers  the  ability  to  shop  with  us  online  do  not  function  effectively,  our  operatingresults, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Many
 of our customers shop with us through our e-commerce website and mobile commerce applications. Increasingly, customers are using tablets and smart phones to shoponline
 with  us  and  with  our  competitors  and  to  do  comparison  shopping.  We  are  increasingly  using  social  media  and  proprietary  mobile  applications  to  interact  with  ourcustomers
 and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offera
 wide  assortment  of  merchandise  with  rapid  delivery  options  and  that  continually  meet  the  changing  expectations  of  online  shoppers  could  place  us  at  a  competitivedisadvantage,
 result  in  the  loss  of  e-commerce  and  other  sales,  harm  our  reputation  with  customers,  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  growth  of  our  e-commercebusiness globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Risks
 specific to our e-commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experiencethrough
 direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our e-commerce business, as well asdamage our reputation and brands.
Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.
We
 believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We periodically discover products that are counterfeitreproductions
 of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property, continued sales of theseproducts could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products.
The
 actions we take to establish and protect  our intellectual  property  rights may not be adequate  to prevent  imitation  of our products  by others  or to prevent others  fromseeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights.
We
 may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also
 may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importationand/or sale of certain products.
We
 take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information. Such actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure
 and non-compete agreements and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure ofconfidential
 information might not always be effective. Confidential information that is related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublishedfinancial
 results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negativeimpact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions.

Table of ContentsIn
 addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may facesignificant
 expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfullyprotect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.
We are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.
We
 currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail tosuccessfully
 market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships,supplier
 relationships  or  credit  risks,  it  could  adversely  affect  our  revenues,  both  directly  from  reduced  royalties  received  and  indirectly  from  reduced  sales  of  our  otherproducts.
We
 also  rely  on  our  licensees  to  help  preserve  the  value  of  our  brands.  Although  we  attempt  to  protect  our  brands  through  approval  rights  over  the  design,  productionprocesses,
 quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands byour licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on 
that brand and on us. We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation.
In
 addition  to  our  own  sensitive  and  proprietary  business  information,  we  collect  transactional  and  personal  information  about  our  customers  and  users  of  our  digitalexperiences,
 which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticatedand
 operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers’,users'
 or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our consumers, customerrelationships
 and our reputation and result in lost sales, lost users, fines, or lawsuits. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/orredress problems caused by any breach.
In
 addition,  we  must  comply  with  increasingly  complex  and  rigorous  regulatory  standards  enacted  to  protect  business  and  personal  data.  Compliance  with  existing  andproposed
 laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure tosecure personal informat
ion could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage toour reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.
Failure
 of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harmour business.
We
 work  with  hundreds  of  contractors  outside  of  the  United  States  to  manufacture  our  products,  and  we  also  have  license  agreements  that  permit  unaffiliated  parties  tomanufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors tha
t directly manufacture our products and our licensees thatmake
 products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safetystandards
 for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations,from
 time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on theircontractors.
 Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as aresult, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition.
Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our
 business.Virtually
 all  of  our  athletic  footwear  and  apparel  is  manufactured  outside  of  the  United  States,  and  the  majority  of  our  products  are  sold  outside  of  the  United  States.Accordingly,
 we  are  subject  to  the  risks  generally  associated  with  global  trade  and  doing  business  abroad,  which  include  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  varying  consumerpreferences across geographic regions, political unrest,
 disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our productsare manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the
 uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit, including changes to the legal andregulatory
 framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union. In addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict haveincreased
 the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products,our
 ability  to  sell  products  in  international  markets  and  our  cost  of  doing  business.  If  any  of  these  or  other  factors  make  the  conduct  of  business  in  a  particular  countryundesirable
 or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost andquantity of
 various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or imposenew
 quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation,product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results o
f operations and financial condition.We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or additional 
tax liabilities.We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and
 numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including theUnited
 States, subject to significant change. There have been proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporationsare
 taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, couldhave
 an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of thosejurisdictions.
 If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective income taxrates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted.

Table of ContentsPortions
 of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. These taxholidays and
 rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if wefail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate,
 our future effective income tax rate would increase in the future.We
 are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood ofan
 adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, thefinal
 determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or relateddisputes
 could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, the IRS hasassessed
 additional tax liabilities for 2011 and 2012 related to a foreign tax credit matter. We are currently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk ofadditional
 tax for these years, if this litigation is adversely determined and the IRS was to seek similar adjustments in subsequent years, we could be subject to significantadditional
 tax liabilities. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe wehave clearly
 reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustmentsthat could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates.
If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions defaul
t on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.As
 part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, optioncontracts,
 collars  and  swaps  with  various  financial  institutions.  In  addition,  we  have  significant  amounts  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  other  investments  on  deposit  or  inaccounts
 with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financialinstitutions.
 The  risk  of  counterparty  default  or  failure  may  be  heightened  during  economic  downturns  and  periods  of  uncertainty  in  the  financial  markets.  If  one  of  ourcounterparties
 were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accountswith such counterpa
rty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failureof one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products.
NIKE is supplied by approximately 
142 footwear factories located in 15 countries. We do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend uponindependent
 contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 2016 , five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than10%
 of  fiscal 2016 footwear  production  and  in  aggregate  accounted  for  approximately 69% of  NIKE  Brand  footwear  production  in  fiscal 2016 .  Our  ability  to  meet  ourcustomers'
 needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers wereto
 sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have amaterial
 adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do notmeet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.
The
 principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture awayfrom
 the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principalmaterials
 used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and syntheticfabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon 
the abilityof
 our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wagerates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the coun
tries in which our products are manufactured.There
 could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not beable
 to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced andmay
 continue  to  experience  in  the  future,  unexpected  increases  in  work  wages,  whether  government  mandated  or  otherwise  and  increases  in  compliance  costs  due  togovernmental
 regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be ableto
 fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer,there can
 be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptableto us,
 or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existingor
 find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturersin
 our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply ofmaterials
 or  manufacture  of  our  products  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  ability  to  meet  retail  customer  and  consumer  demand  for  our  products  and  result  in  lowerrevenues and net income both in the short- and long-term.
Because
 independent  manufacturers  make  a  majority  of  our  products  outside  of  our  principal  sales  markets,  our  products  must  be  transported  by  third  parties  over  largegeographic distances. Dela
ys in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or otherfactors,
 and  costs  and  delays  associated  with  consolidating  or  transitioning  between  manufacturers,  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  performance.  In  addition,manufacturing
 delays  or  unexpected  demand  for  our  products  may  require  us  to  use  faster,  but  more  expensive,  transportation  methods  such  as  air  freight,  which  couldadversely
 affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products canadversely affect our profit margins.

Table of ContentsIn addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2016, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services
for
 NIKE  Brand  products  sold  in  certain  NIKE  markets  including  Argentina,  Uruguay,  Brazil,  Canada,  India,  South  Africa  and  Thailand  (collectively  the  “Sojitz  Markets”),excluding
 products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America’s banks could disrupt ourability
 to acquire  products  from our suppliers  and to deliver products  to our customers  in the  Sojitz  Markets.  Such a disruption  could result in canceled  orders that  wouldadversely affect sales and profitability.
Our success depends on our global distribution facilities.
We
 distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations,manage
 inventory,  complete  sales  and  achieve  objectives  for  operating  efficiencies  and  growth,  particularly  in  emerging  markets,  depends  on  the  proper  operation  of  ourdistribution
 facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved inshipping
 product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes orfires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilitie
s could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequatelyprotect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.
We rely significantly on
 information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure,inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to ef
fectively operate our business.We
 are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party hosted services (“information technology systems”), acrossour
 supply  chain,  including  product  design,  production,  forecasting,  ordering,  manufacturing,  transportation,  sales  and  distribution,  as  well  as  for  processing  financialinformation for external and internal reporting purposes, retai
l operations and other business activities. Our information technology systems are critical to many of our operatingactivities and our
 business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain ourinventory and to ship products to customers on
 a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Over a number of years, we haveimplemented
 information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and relatedprocesses
 in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result ofsecurity
 breaches, viruses, hackers or other causes, or our failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade our systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded orreplacement
 systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problemand may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and 
financial condition.We
 also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financialreporting,
 legal and tax requirements. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectivelyresolve
 the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputationaldamage. Furthermore, we
 depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement andthe
 marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among ouremployees
 as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in our information technology systems may impede ourability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of
 users.The market for prime real estate is competitive.
Our
 ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability ofreal
 estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew ourexisting
 real  estate  leases.  In  addition,  from  time  to  time,  we  seek  to  downsize,  consolidate,  reposition  or  close  some  of  our  real  estate  locations,  which  may  requiremodification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of
our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and 
financial condition.Additionally,
 the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This couldimpact the quality of our decisio
ns to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality ofthese
 decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, whichcould have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
Extreme
 weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operatingresults
 and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their relatedconsequences
 and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result ineconomic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.
From time
 to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses,such
 as our retail operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growthand
 profitability. However, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. Thefailure
 of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attentionfrom more profitable business operations.
13

Table of ContentsWe are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result 
in unexpected expense of time and resources.From
 time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation andregulatory
 proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business,financial
 condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management’s attention from our operationsand result in substantial legal fees.
We depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business.
Our future
 success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business.Our
 future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategicinitiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.
The sale of a
 large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock.As
 of June 30, 2016, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned more than 78% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2016, all of these shares were converted into Class BCommon
 Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to therequirements
 of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantialnumber
 of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to holdthe
 majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. On June 30, 2016, Mr. Knight sold his voting interest in Swoosh, LLC to a trust controlled by his son and NIKE director,Travis Knight.
Changes
 in  our  credit  ratings  or  macroeconomic  conditions  may  affect  our  liquidity,  increasing  borrowing  costs  and  limiting  ourfinancing options.
Our
 long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term
 debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subjectto
 restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, makeinvestments,
 loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenantscould
 result  in  a  default,  and  as  a  result,  the  commitments  of  our  lenders  under  our  credit  agreements  may  be  terminated  and  the  maturity  of  amounts  owed  may  beaccelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.
If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected.
Our
 internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements  because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  including  the  possibility  of  human  error,  thecircumvention
 or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation offinancial
 statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experiencedifficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
If
 our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adverselyaffected.
The
 preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make estimatesand
 assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and onvarious
 other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  as  provided  in  “Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  andResults
 of  Operations.”  The  results  of  these  estimates  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  the  carrying  values  of  assets,  liabilities  and  equity,  and  the  amount  ofrevenue and
 expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements includethose
 related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventories, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property,plant and
 equipment and definite-lived assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change orif
 actual  circumstances  differ  from  those  in  our  assumptions,  which  could  cause  our  operating  results  to  fall  below  the  expectations  of  securities  analysts  and  investors,resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock.
Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock.
There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to
 protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt todeny
 coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, afreeze-out statute, two classes of stock that
 vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directorsrounded
 down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of ourcompany that some sharehol
ders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing marketprice. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company.
14

Table of ContentsWe may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.
Our
 Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports includeinformation
 about our historical financial results as well as analysts’ estimates of our future performance. Analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are oftendifferent
 from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price coulddecline.
 In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stockprice
 is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention andresources that are needed to successfully run our business.

 designs,  develops,  markets  and  sells  athletic  footwear,  apparel,  equipment,  accessories  and  services  worldwide.  We  are  the  largest  seller  of  athletic  footwear  andapparel
 in  the  world.  We  sell  our  products  to  retail  accounts,  through  NIKE-owned  in-line  and  factory  retail  stores  and  NIKE-owned  internet  websites  (which  we  refer  tocollective
ly as our “Direct to Consumer” or “DTC” operations) and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries aroundthe
 world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Ourstrategy
 is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and deliveringcompelling consumer experiences at retail and online.
In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas:
•
Expanding gross margin by: - 
Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value equation for consumers;- 
Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation;- 
Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential toincrease both customization of our products and speed to market; and
- 
Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business, led by NIKE.com, as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our DTC and wholesaleoperations.
•
Optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on: - 
Investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit; - 
Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and- 
Investments in key areas of future growth, including our DTC business.•
Managing working capital efficiency; and •
Deploying capital effectively. Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2020, on average per year, are as follows:
•
High single-digit to low-double digit revenue growth; •
Mid-teens earnings per share growth; •
High-twenties to low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital; •
Free cash flow growing faster than net income; and •
Sustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Over
 the past ten years, we have achieved many of our financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of bothcontinuing
 and discontinued operations, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. We expanded gross margin by approximately 220 basispoints and our return on invested capital has increased from 22.6% to 29.7%.
On
 November 19, 2015, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stockdividend
 payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price onDecember 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split.
Our
 fiscal  2016  results  demonstrated  the  power  of  the  NIKE,  Inc.  portfolio  to  deliver  continued  growth  and  expanding  profitability.  Despite  significant  foreign  currencyheadwinds,
 we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2016. NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew  6% to $32.4 billion, gross margin expanded 20 basis points, Net income 
increased 15% and diluted ea rnings per common share grew 17% to $2.16. We also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for long-term growth.Earnings
 before interest and income taxes ("EBIT") increased 10% for fiscal 2016, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, while selling and administrativeexpense
 was flat as a percent of revenues. The increase in revenues was attributable to growth for nearly every NIKE Brand geography and across most key categories andproduct types. This broad-based growth was primarily fueled by:
•
Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri-Fit and Flyknit; •
Deep  brand  connections  with  consumers  through  our  category  offense,  reinforced  by  investments  in  endorsements  by  high-profile  athletes,  sports  teams  andleagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing; and
•
Strong category retail presentation online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. Converse
 revenues and EBIT decreased 1% and 6%, respectively, as growth in direct distribution markets was more than offset by the negative impact of changes in foreigncurrency exchange rates.
Gross
 margin increased primarily due to higher full-price average selling price and the favorable impact of growth in our higher-margin DTC businesses, partially offset byhigher
 product  costs,  primarily due  to shifts  in mix to  higher-cost  products  and  labor input  cost  inflation,  higher  off-price  mix and  unfavorable  changes  in  foreign  currencyexchange rates.

Table of ContentsFor
 fiscal 2016, the growth in Net  income was  positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 350 basis points primarily due to an increase in theproportion of earnings from operations outsid
e the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate thanNet income 
due to a 1% decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program. While
 foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing ourbusiness to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.

Compared to Fiscal 2015 On
 a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew  12% for fiscal 2016,  primarily driven  by higher revenues  for the  NIKE  Brand.  Every NIKE  Brand geography  grewrevenues
 for fiscal 2016 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers online andat
 NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving strong demand for NIKE Brand products. North America contributed approximately 4 percentage points of the increase inNIKE, Inc. revenues, while Greater China and Western Europe each contr
ibuted approximately 3 percentage points, Emerging Markets contributed approximately 2 percentagepoints and Central & Eastern Europe contributed approximately 1 percentage point.
Excluding
 the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 15% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, while NIKEBrand
 equipment revenues decreased 2%. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, including stronggrowth
 in  Sportswear,  the  Jordan  Brand  and  Running.  Footwear  unit  sales  for  fiscal  2016  increased  9%,  with  higher  average  selling  price  (ASP)  per  pair  contributingapproximately
 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of anincrease in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business.
The constant-currency increase in NIKE
 Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men's Training, Running,Women's
 Training  and  Football  (Soccer).  Apparel  unit  sales  for  fiscal  2016  increased  7%.  Higher  ASP  per  unit  contributed  approximately  4  percentage  points  of  apparelrevenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in our higher-priced DTC business.
While wholesale revenues remain the largest
 component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. NIKE BrandDTC
 operations  include  NIKE-owned  in-line  and  factory  stores,  as  well  as  online  sales  through  NIKE-owned  websites.  For  fiscal  2016,  DTC  revenues  representedapproximately
 26% of our total NIKE Brand revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 25% for fiscal 2016, driven by strong online sales growth, theaddition
 of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 10%. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three ofthe
 following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3)the store has not
 been permanently repositioned within the past year. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 51%in fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2016, online sales represented approximately 22% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues.
On a
 wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2016 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 11%, driven by growth inSportswear
 and the Jordan Brand, while Women's revenues increased 17%, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training. Revenues for our Young Athletes' businessincreased 11%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand.
Fiscal 2015 
Compared to Fiscal 2014 On a currency-neutral basis, revenues from NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 14% for fiscal 2015, driven by
 increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse.Every
 NIKE  Brand  geography  delivered  higher  revenues  for  fiscal  2015  as  our  category  offense  continued  to  deliver  innovative  products,  deep  brand  connections  andcompelling
 retail  experiences  to  consumers.  North  America  contributed  5  percentage  points  of  the  increase  in  NIKE,  Inc.  revenues,  while  Western  Europe  contributed  4percentage points, Greater China contributed 2 percentage points and Central & Eastern Europe, 
Emerging Markets and Converse each contributed 1 percentage point.Excluding
 the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 17% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipmentrevenues
 increased 1% during fiscal 2015. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by strong performance in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand,Running,
 NIKE  Basketball  and  Football  (Soccer).  Footwear  unit  sales  in  fiscal  2015  increased  9%.  Higher  ASP  per  pair  contributed  approximately  8  percentage  points  offootwear revenue growth, driven primarily by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business.
The
 constant-currency increase in NIKE  Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Women'sTraining,
 which were partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer) due largely to the comparison to significant sales of replica apparel in advance of the World Cup in 2014.Fiscal
 2015 unit sales of apparel increased 8% with higher ASP per unit contributing approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven primarily by growthin our higher-priced DTC business.
For
 fiscal 2015, DTC revenues represented approximately 23% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 20% in fiscal 2014. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenuesgrew
 29% for fiscal 2015, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 16%, significant online sales growth and the addition of new stores. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites grew 59% in fiscal 2015. Online sales represented approximately 18% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2015 compared to 15% for 
fiscal 2014.24

 calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Excluding the impact of currencychanges, futures orders increased 
11% , with unit orders increasing 4% and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 7 percentage points of growth.By geography, futures orders growth was as follows:

Reported  futures have been restated using prior year exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends, excluding theimpact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
The
 reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipmenttiming, changes in the mix of
 orders between futures and at-once orders, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition,exchange
 rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actualrevenues.
 Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKEBrand
 equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and e-commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf andHurley.

Compared to Fiscal 2015 For fiscal 2016, our consolidated gross margin was 20 basis points higher than fiscal 2015, primarily attributable to the following factors:
•
Higher  NIKE Brand full-price ASP (increasing gross margin approximately 190 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premium products withhigher prices and, to a lesser extent, due to price increases reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories;
•
Growth in our higher-margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points); •
Higher  NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) as shifts in mix to higher-cost products and labor input cost inflation wereonly partially offset by lower material input costs;
•
Higher off-price mix (decreasing gross margin approximately 30 basis points), primarily reflecting the impacts from clearing excess inventory in North America; •
Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedges (decreasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points); •
Higher other costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primarily due to higher product design and development costs; and •
Lower gross margin from Converse (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primari ly resulting from shifts in mix to lower-margin products.Fiscal 2015

Fiscal 2016 
Compared to Fiscal 2015 Demand
 creation expense increased  2% for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to investments in digital brand marketing, including for our DTC business, aswell
 as  support  for  key  brand  events  and  initiatives,  and  sports  marketing  investments,  partially  offset  by  lower  advertising  expense.  For  fiscal  2016,  changes  in  foreigncurrency exchange rates decreased growth in 
Demand creation expense by approximately 6 percentage points. Operating
 overhead expense increased  8% compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of continued investments in our DTC business, including new store openings andhigher

Our
 operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company’s internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operationsparticipating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each
 NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment.The
 Company’s  reportable  operating  segments  for  the  NIKE  Brand  are:  North  America,  Western  Europe,  Central  &  Eastern  Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  EmergingMarkets,
 and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company’s NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.Converse
 is  also  a  reportable  segment  for  the  Company  and  operates  in  one  industry:  the  design,  marketing,  licensing  and  selling  of  casual  sneakers,  apparel  andaccessories.
As
 part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in ourgeographic
 operating  segments  and  Converse.  These  rates  are  set  approximately  nine  and  twelve  months  in  advance  of  the  future  selling  seasons  to  which  they  relate(specifically,
 for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons)based
 on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for  geographic operating segments andConverse
 reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency. Differences between assigned standardforeign
 currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreignexchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

Compared to Fiscal 2015 Excluding
 changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  North  America  revenues  increased  8%  primarily  due  to  growth  in  our  Sportswear,  Jordan  Brand  and  Runningcategories. DTC revenues grew 17% for fiscal 2016, fueled by strong online sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 6%.
Currency-neutral
 footwear revenue growth was attributable to higher revenues in most key categories, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Running and Women's Training,partially
 offset by a slight decline in NIKE Basketball. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 8%. Higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 2percentage
 points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-pricedDTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix.
Apparel
 revenue growth for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by our Sportswear and Men's Training categories. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of apparel grew 7%. Higher ASP perunit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP.
Reported
 EBIT increased  3% for fiscal 2016 as higher revenues were largely offset  by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative  expense as a percent  ofrevenues.
 Gross margin declined 80 basis points as higher off-price mix, higher warehousing and inventory obsolescence costs, as well as higher product input costs morethan
 offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead to support our growing DTC operationsand
 bad debt expense related to customer bankruptcies was only partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. Demand creation also grew at a faster rate thanrevenues due to higher spending for sports marketing, DTC marketing and key brand events and initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising expense.
Fiscal 2015 
Compared to Fiscal 2014 North America revenues increased 12%, despite congestion at
 ports on the West Coast of the United States in the second half of the fiscal year, which affected the Company'ssupply
 chain and flow of product to customers. Revenue growth was driven by nearly all key categories for fiscal 2015, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Men's Training,NIKE
 Basketball and Women's Training. On a constant currency basis, DTC revenue grew 17% for fiscal 2015, fueled by comparable store sales growth of 8%, strong onlinesales growth and the addition of new stores.

 primarily Sportswear and Running. DTC revenues increased 48%, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 28%, the addition of new stores and onlinesales growth.
The
 constant currency growth in footwear revenue in fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear and Running. Fiscal 2015 unitsales
 of footwear increased 11%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 11 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP, primarilyreflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories.
The
 constant currency growth in apparel revenue in fiscal 2015 resulted from growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear and Running, partially offset by a decline inFootball (Soccer) due to comparison to
 strong sales related to the World Cup in fiscal 2014. Unit sales of apparel increased 1% for fiscal 2015. Higher ASP per unit contributedapproximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories.
On
 a reported basis, EBIT declined  11% for fiscal 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Reported revenue increases and slightselling
 and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased 340 basis points as higher product costs and unfavorablestandard
 foreign currency exchange rates were only partially offset by higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenue despiteincreases
 in both demand creation and operating overhead. Operating overhead increased primarily as a result of investments in our growing DTC business, while demandcreation increased as a result of higher sports marketing costs.

 and 26%, respectively. Revenues in our Mexico and Brazil territories decreased 21% and 3%, respectively. The decrease in Mexico was attributable to efforts to liquidateexcess
 inventory in the marketplace largely resulting from an inconsistent flow of product to customers following distribution center transition issues in fiscal 2014, while thedecrease
 in Brazil was primarily due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and comparison to strong sales related to the World Cup in fiscal 2014. On a category basis,revenues were higher in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Action Sports and the
 Jordan Brand, partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer). DTC revenuesincreased 51% compared to fiscal 2014, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 26%, the addition of new stores and online sales growth.
The
 constant currency growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2015 was attributable to increases in several key categories, most notably Sportswear, Action Sports, the JordanBrand
 and Running. Unit sales of footwear decreased 2% while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 11 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASPper

 fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of direct distributionmarket
 revenue growth. On a territory basis, growth in the United States and Asia Pacific was partially offset by declines in Europe, primarily the United Kingdom. Conversionof
 markets  from  licensed  to  direct  distribution  markets  had  an  insignificant  impact  on  total  Converse  revenue  growth  for  fiscal  2016.  Revenues  from  comparable  licensedmarkets decreased 15% for fiscal 2016, reducing total Converse revenue growth by
 approximately 1 percentage point. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenueswas primarily due to poor macroeconomic conditions in Latin America.

Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices
Overview
As
 a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchangerates.
 Our  primary  foreign  currency  exposures  arise  from  the  recording  of  transactions  denominated  in  non-functional  currencies  and  the  translation  of  foreign  currencydenominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.
Our
 foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations,financial posit
ion and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage theseexposures
 by  taking  advantage  of  natural  offsets  and  currency  correlations  that  exist  within  the  portfolio  and,  where  practical  and  material,  by  hedging  a  portion  of  theremaining
 exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company ("NTC") andour foreign currency adjustment program enhanced
 our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that existwithin
 our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying netexposures
 being  hedged.  Where  exposures  are  hedged,  our  program  has  the  effect  of  delaying  the  impact  of  exchange  rate  movements  on  our  Consolidated  FinancialStatements; the length of the delay is dependent
 upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Transactional Exposures
We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:
•
Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctua tions in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.
Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: a.
Certain  NIKE  entities  purchase  product  from  the  NTC,  a  wholly-owned  sourcing  hub  that  buys  NIKE  branded  products  from  third-party  factories,predominantly
 in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functionalcurrencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the
 result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.
Other  NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for thoseNIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.
35

Table of Contents2.
Factory  input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreigncurrency
 risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures.Under this program, our pay
ments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which thelabor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.
For
 the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting theproduct
 cost is recorded within Inventories and  is recognized in Cost  of sales when  the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices,excluding
 the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair valuethrough 
Other  (income)  expense,  net .  Refer  to Note  16  —  Risk  Management  and  Derivatives in  the  accompanying  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements for additional detail.
As
 an offset  to the impacts  of the fluctuating  U.S. Dollar on our non-functional  currency denominated  product  purchases described above, a strengthe ning U.S.
 Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakeningU.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.
•
Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our
 Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses theEuro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.
•
Other  Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certaincases, the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to
 foreign currencies and create embedded derivativecontracts that are recorded at fair value through 
  Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.
•
Non-Functional  Currency  Denominated  Monetary  Assets  and  Liabilities  —  Our  global  subsidiaries  have  various  assets  and  liabilities,  primarily  receivables  andpayables,
 including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subjectto re-measurement which may create fluctuations in 
Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. Managing Transactional Exposures
Transactional
 exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of naturaloffsets
 and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect ofexchange
 rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost purchase exposures, non-functional currency denominated external salesand
 other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except forhedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below.
Certain
 currency  forward  contracts  used  to  manage  the  foreign  exchange  exposure  of  non-functional  currency  denominated  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  subject  to  re-measurement and
 the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives andhedging.
 Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other  (income) expense, net and  are intended to offset the foreign currencyimpact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged.
Refer
 to Note  6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements foradditional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.
Translational Exposures
Many
 of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results aswe
 are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreignsubsidiaries’
 non-U.S.  Dollar  denominated  balance  sheets  into  U.S.  Dollars  for  consolidated  reporting  results  in  a  cumulative  translation  adjustment  to Accumulated  othercomprehensive
 income within  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Shareholders’  Equity.  In  the  translation  of  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income,  a  weaker  U.S.  Dollar  inrelation
 to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchangerate
 fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was  a detriment of approximately $1,985 million and $1,171 million for the years ended May 31, 2016 and2015,
 respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income  before income taxes was  a detriment of approximately $449 million and$221 million for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Managing Translational Exposures
To minimize the impact of translat
ing foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excesscash
 to  purchase  U.S.  Dollar  denominated  available-for-sale  investments.  The  variable  future  cash  flows  associated  with  the  purchase  and  subsequent  sale  of  theseU.S.
 Dollar  denominated  securities  at  non-U.S.  Dollar  functional  currency  subsidiaries  creates  a  foreign  currency  exposure  that  qualifies  for  hedge  accounting  under  theaccounting
 standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of theseU.S.
 Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year
 foreign  currency  translation  impact  on  net  earnings  in  the  period  the  investments  are  sold.  Hedges  of  available-for-sale  investments  are  accounted  for  as  cash  flowhedges.

 to Note  6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements foradditional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.
We estimate the combination of
 translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency relatedgains
 and losses included in Other  (income) expense, net had  an unfavorable impact of approximately $423 million and $73 million on our Income  before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Net Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries
We
 are  also  exposed  to  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  on  our  investments  in  wholly-owned  foreign  subsidiaries  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  theU.S.
 Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged andmay,
 in  the  future,  hedge  net  investment  positions  in  certain  foreign  subsidiaries  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  on  these  net  investments.  Thesehedges
 are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for net investment hedges. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2016 and2015. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31
, 2016 and 2015.Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Activity
Cash
 provided by operations was $3,096 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $4,680 million for fiscal 2015 .  Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2016 was Netincome 
of $3,760 million . Our fiscal 2016 change  in working capital was a net cash outflow of $1,580 million as  compared to a net cash inflow of $256 million for fiscal 2015 . The
 change in working capital was primarily due to a net decrease in the amount of cash collateral received as a result of hedging activities (refer to the Credit Risk section ofNote
 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives for  additional detail).  For fiscal 2016, cash collateral received  from counterparties  declined $863 million as compared to anincrease in collateral received from counterparties of $968 million for fiscal 2015.
Cash used by investing activities 
was $1,034 million for fiscal 2016 , compared to a $175 million use of cash for fiscal 2015 . The primary driver of the increase in Cash used by investing
 activities was  the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) from net sales/maturities to net purchases. In fiscal 2016, therewere 
$57  million of  net purchases of short-term investments compared to $935  million of  net sales/maturities of short-term investments in the same period of fiscal 2015.Additions
 to property, plant and equipment were $1,143  million for  fiscal 2016 as compared to $963  million for  fiscal 2015. The increase in Additions  to property, plant andequipment 
resulted  from continued investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, primarily relating to supply chain and corporate initiatives, as well asexpansion of our DTC operations.
In fiscal 2017, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, as
 well as expand our digital capabilities. We anticipate investing approximately 4% ofrevenue, a portion of which will be used for the continued expansion of our corporate facilities, new DTC stores and digital capabilities.
Cash used
 by financing activities was $2,671 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $2,790 million for fiscal 2015 ,  a decrease of $119 million, as increases in share repurchasesand dividends were more than offset by the receipt of $981 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in Oc
tober 2015.In 
fiscal 2016 , we purchased 55.4 million shares of  NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $3,238 million (an average  price of $ 58.44 ). During the  third quarter of fiscal 2016, weconcluded the
 Company's four-year, $8 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2012. Under this program the Company purchaseda
 total of 197.1 million shares at a cost of $8 billion (an average price of $40.58 per share). Following the completion of this program, the Company began purchases under afour-year,
 $12 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in November 2015. Of the total 55.4  million shares  repurchased in fiscal 2016, 20.1  million shares  werepurchased
 under this new program at a cost of approximately $1,189  million (an  average price of $59.21 per  share). We continue to expect funding of share repurchases willcome from operating cash flow, excess cash and/or debt. The timing and the amount of
 shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.Capital Resources
On
 April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the "Shelf") with the SEC which permitted us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. On April 23, 2013, weissued
 $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a2.25% fixed,
 annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed,annual
 interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted ingross
 proceeds before expenses of $998 million. On October 29, 2015, we issued an additional $1.0 billion of senior notes at a 3.875% fixed, annual interest rate that willmature
 on  November  1,  2045.  Interest  on  the  senior  notes  is  payable  semi-annually  on  May  1  and  November  1  of  each  year.  The  issuance  resulted  in  proceeds  beforeexpenses of $991 million. The Shelf expired on April 23, 2016. We plan to file a new shelf registration statement
 with the SEC in July 2016.On
 August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility maturesAugust
 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. This facilityreplaces the prior $1 billion credit facility agreement entered into on November 1, 2011, which would have matured November 1, 2017. As of and for the periods ended 
May 31, 2016 
and 2015 , we had no amounts outstanding under either committed credit facility. 37

Table of ContentsWe
 currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings wereto
 decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee andinterest rate would decre
ase. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings underthe committed credit facil
ity. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets,the
 amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowingsoutstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable
 to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would becomeimmediately
 due  and  payable.  As  of May  31, 2016 ,  we  were  in  full  compliance  with  each  of  these  covenants  and  believe  it  is  unlikely  we  will  fail  to  meet  any  of  thesecovenants in the foreseeable future.
Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program, which increased $1 billion dur
ing the second quarter of fiscal 2016. During the year ended May 31, 2016 , we did not
 issue commercial paper, and as of May 31, 2016 , there  were no outstanding borrowings under this program. Any future issuance of commercial paper or other debtsecurities
 during fiscal 2017 will depend on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation andMoody's Investor Services, respectively.
As
 of May  31, 2016 ,  we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.5  billion ,  of which $4.6  billion was  held by our foreign subsidiaries. Included inCash
 and equivalents as  of May 31, 2016 was $105  million of  cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity. Cash  equivalents and Short-terminvestments 
consist primaril y of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsoredenterprise obligat
ions and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investmentsare
 investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May  31, 2016 ,  the weighted average remaining duration of our cashequivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 
91  days.To
 date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costsassociated
 with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-terminvestments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of 
funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capitalneeds in the foreseeable future.
We
 utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate aportion
 of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our currentplans
 do not demonstrate  a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States,  we may elect to repatriate  indefinitely  reinvestedforeign funds
 or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additionalU.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United 
States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In
 connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issuesthat
 arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and theestimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.

The  cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicablefixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of 
May 31, 2016 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. (2)
The  amounts  listed  for  endorsement  contracts  represent  approximate  amounts  of  base  compensation  and  minimum  guaranteed  royalty  fees  we  are  obligated  to  payathlete,
 sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide forbonuses
 to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts mayalso be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.
In
 addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on thisproduct
 on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to theendorsers
 will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regardingproduct and marketing initiatives. In
 addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of timeand are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.
(3)
We  generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from external wholesale customers and internalorders
 from our DTC in-line stores and e-commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchaseorders)
 to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices aresubject to change throughout the production process.
(4)
Other  purchase obligations primarily include service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in theordinary
 course  of  business.  The  amounts  represent  the  minimum  payments  required  by  legally  binding  contracts  and  agreements  that  specify  all  significant  terms,including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.
In
 addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate whencash
 payments will occur. Refer to Note  9 — Income Taxes and Note 13 — Benefit Plans in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for furtherinformation related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively.
We
 also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May  31, 2016 .  Refer to Note  7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in  the accompanyingNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the
 short-term debt obligations listed below.

New Accounting Pronouncements
Refer
 to Note  1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in  the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issuedaccounting standards.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our
 previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared inaccordance
 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates andjudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.39

Table of ContentsWe
 believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements,so
 we  consider  these  to  be  our  critical  accounting  policies.  Because  of  the  uncertainty  inherent  in  these  matters,  actual  results  could  differ  from  the  estimates  we  use  inapplying
 the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, theallowance
 for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates inthe
 preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generallyknown
 within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscalquarters.
Within
 the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially differentamounts being reported.
Revenue Recognition
We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of
 sale. Title passes generally uponshipment
 or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of saleand online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.
In
 some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Ourrevenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.
In
 certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the dateof
 receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests  of actual transactions, we have no indication that theseestimates have been materially inaccurate historically.
As
 part  of  our  revenue  recognition  policy,  we  record  estimated  sales  returns,  discounts  and  miscellaneous  claims  from  customers  as  reductions  to  revenues  at  the  timerevenues
 are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted tocertain
 customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims andoutstanding
 returns  not  yet  received  from  customers  and  (3)  estimated  returns,  discounts  and  claims  expected  but  not  yet  finalized  with  our  customers.  Actual  returns,discounts
 and  claims  in  any  future  period  are  inherently  uncertain  and  thus  may  differ  from  our  estimates.  If  actual  or  expected  future  returns,  discounts  and  claims  aresignificantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination.
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable
We make ongoing estimates re
lating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customersto
 make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness ofsignificant
 customers  based  on  ongoing  credit  evaluations.  Since  we  cannot  predict  future  changes  in  the  financial  stability  of  our  customers,  actual  future  losses  fromuncollectible
 accounts  may  differ  from  our  estimates.  If  the  financial  condition  of  our  customers  were  to  deteriorate,  resulting  in  their  inability  to  make  payments,  a  largerallowance might
 be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.
Inventory Reserves
We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
If we estimate thatthe
 net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of theinventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to 
Cost of sales . If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizabl
e value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales 
. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts
A
 significant portion of our Demand  creation expense relates  to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over theterm of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently,
 based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain
 contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creationexpense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.
Certain
 contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining aspecified
 ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in Demand  creation expense ratably  over the contract periodbased on our
 best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in theendorser’s performance, increased or decreased 
Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. Certain
 contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as
 the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteedamount
 of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed  payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand  creationexpense 
uniformly over the contract term. 40

Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Live
d AssetsProperty,
 plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor)and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in
 circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differencesbetween
 the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciationexpense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value.
We
 review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount ofthe
 assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an assetis used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect
 the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of anasset,
 among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset groupexceeds
 the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of theprimary
 asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the assetgroup
 using  appropriate  valuation  methodologies  that  would  typically  include  an  estimate  of  discounted  cash  flows.  Any  impairment  would  be  measured  as  the  differencebetween the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangi
ble AssetsWe
 perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstanceschange
 that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes incircumstanc
es that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planneddivestitures
 or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikely
 than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is morelikely than
 not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires usto
 estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and weproceed
 to  step  two  of  the  impairment  analysis.  In  step  two  of  the  analysis,  we  measure  and  record  an  impairment  loss  equal  to  the  excess  of  the  carrying  value  of  thereporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.
We
 generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuationapproach.
 The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit togenerate
 in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability ofthe
 reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit tocomparable
 publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies withcomparable business factors
 such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimatingthe fair value of the reporting unit.
Indefinite-l
ived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likelythan
 not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that theindefinite-lived
 intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for theseintangible
 assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of theobligation
 to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate andthe weighted average cost of capital.
Fair Value Measurements
For
 financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderlytransaction
 with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities todetermine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.
In
 the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quotedprices
 for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodologyapplies to our Level 2 investments such as time deposits, commercial paper and bonds, U.S. Agency securities and money market funds. 
Level
 3  investments  are  valued  using  internally  developed  models  with  unobservable  inputs.  Assets  and  liabilities  measured  using  unobservable  inputs  are  an  immaterialportion of our portfolio.
A
 majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted marketprice
 in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yieldcurves
 observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values arerecorded. These controls include a comparison to another independent pricing vendor.

 use  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  certain  anticipated  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  transactions  as  well  as  certain  non-functional  currency  monetary  assets  andliabilities.

 hedge derivatives being released from Other  comprehensive income into Net income sometime  after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accountingtreatment
 is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates ofanticipated
 transactions  may  fluctuate  over  time  and  may  ultimately  vary  from  actual  transactions.  When  anticipated  transaction  estimates  or  actual  transaction  amountsdecline
 below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month
 period  of  time  thereafter,  we  are  required  to  reclassify  the  cumulative  change  in  fair  value  of  the  over-hedged  portion  of  the  related  hedge  contract  from Other comprehensive income 
to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. We have used in the past, and may use in the future, forward contracts or opt
ions to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreigncurrency
 translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported inthe
 cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated  other comprehensive income within Total  shareholders’ equity ,  to the extent effective, to offset the foreigncurrency
 translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedgeis
 placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less thanthat
 of  other  types  of  hedge  transactions  and  we  do  not  expect  any  material  ineffectiveness.  We  consider,  on  a  quarterly  basis,  the  need  to  redesignate  existing  hedgerelationships
 based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value ofthe over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as 
Other (income) expense, net during the period in which changes occur. Stock-based Compensation
We
 account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. TheBlack-Scholes
 option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in markettraded
 options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of activelytraded options
 on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change andwe
 use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future fromthat recorded in the current period.
Income Taxes
We
 record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependenton
 future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxableincome.
 To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income  tax expense in the period when such determination is made.
In
 addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducingour overall 
Income  tax expense .  The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshoreassets and our
 expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earningsto be indefinitely reinvested offshore.
We
 carefully  review  all  factors  that  drive  the  ultimate  disposition  of  foreign  earnings  determined  to  be  reinvested  offshore  and  apply  stringent  standards  to  overcome  thepresumption
 of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amountsdeclared
 as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or theactual cash needs of
 our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were
 no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxeshave been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our 
Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On
 an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before
 income taxes excluding  infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income  tax expense .  The income tax effects of infrequent or unusualitems
 are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings byjurisdiction
 during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjustthe income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.
On
 a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positionsbased
 on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in therecognition
 of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment  changes.  We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxmatters in 
Income tax expense . 42

Table of ContentsOther Contingencies
In
 the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and avariety
 of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amountof the
 loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments aboutthe
 potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period areinherently uncertai
n. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional chargesduring
 the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilitieswhen
 there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters withcertainty,
 we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations,financial position or cash flows.

Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosur
es about Market RiskIn
 the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations inthe
 value  of  foreign  currencies  and  interest  rates.  It  is  our  policy  to  utilize  these  financial  instruments  only  where  necessary  to  finance  our  business  and  manage  suchexposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.
We are
 exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk managementprogram is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctua
tions on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We useforward
 and  option  contracts  to  hedge  certain  anticipated  but  not  yet  firmly  committed  transactions  as  well  as  certain  firm  commitments  and  the  related  receivables  andpayables, inclu
ding third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in thenet
 assets  of  certain  international  subsidiaries  to  offset  foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  related  to  our  net  investment  in  those  subsidiaries.  Where  exposures  arehedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate
 movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The
 timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon thenature
 of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecastedtransaction and may place incremental hedges up to 
100% of the exposure by the time the  forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2016 
are  designated as  foreign  currency  cash  flow  hedges,  primarily  for  Euro/U.S.  Dollar,  British  Pound/Euro  and  Japanese  Yen/U.S.  Dollar  currency  pairs. See  section“Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices” under Item 7 for additional detail.
Our
 earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates.  Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact ofinterest
 rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans,fixed-rate
 debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed-rate debt, as well as pay-fixed, receive-variable forward-starting interest rate swaps for cash outflows of interest payments on future debt.
Market Risk Measurement
We
 monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk
 (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts,  interest rate swaps,intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.
We
 use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximumpotential
 one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95%confidence
 level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies andinterest
 rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over thepreceding
 one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potentialloss
 in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currencyrate
 fluctuations  on  the  derivative  instruments  only  and  does  not  include  the  impact  of  such  rate  fluctuations  on  non-functional  currency  transactions  (such  as  anticipatedtransactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.
The
 VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent  actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential  effect  of favorablechanges in
 market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because ofchanges or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
The
 estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $109 million and $117million
 at May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The VaR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivativeportfolio at May 31, 2016. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of
 our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. Theaverage
 monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $209 million and $205 million during fiscal 2016and fiscal 2015, respectively.
The
 instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interestrate
 U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functionalcurrency
 intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above.Therefore, we
 consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidatedfinancial position, results from operations and cash flows.
During
 the year ended May 31, 2016, we entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. A forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement thateffectively
 hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. We entered intothese forward-starting interest rate
 swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt. These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges ofthe variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt
 due to changes in benchmark interest rates.Details
 of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates byexpected maturity dates.

portingManagement
 is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) -15(f)
 of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  Internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  thereliability
 of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the UnitedStates
 of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only inaccordance
 with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect
 on the financial statements.While
 “reasonable assurance” is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reportingmay not
 prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two ormore
 people,  including  our  senior  management.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  becomeinadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
 Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of ourinternal control
 over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control  — Integrated Framework (2013) issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ofthe
 Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as ofMay 31, 2016

 based on our integrated  audits. We conducted  our audits  in accordance  with the standards  of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight  Board (United States).Those
 standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement andwhether
 effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,evidence
 supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management andevaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting,
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our
 audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for ouropinions.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliabil

Description of Business
NIKE, Inc. is
 a worldwide leader in the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE, Inc.portfolio
 brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse. The  NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessoriesand
 services  across  a  wide  range  of  sport  categories,  amplified  with  sport-inspired  sportswear  products  carrying  the  Swoosh  trademark  as  well  as  other  NIKE  Brandtrademarks. 
The  Jordan  Brand  is  focused  on  athletic  and  casual  footwear,  apparel  and  accessories,  using  the  Jumpman  trademark.  Sales  of  Jordan  Brand  products  arereported
 as a separate category within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. The Hurley brand is focused on surf and action sports and youth lifestylefootwear, apparel and accessories, using the
 Hurley trademark. Sales of Hurley brand products are included within the NIKE Brand Action Sports category and within the NIKEBrand's
 North America geographic  operating segment,  respectively.  Converse  designs, distributes,  markets and sells casual sneakers,  apparel and accessories  under theConverse,
 Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties whodesign, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.
Basis of Consolidation
The
 Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All significant intercompany transactions and balances havebeen eliminated.
On November 19,
 2015, the Company announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stockdividend
 payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price onDecember 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to 
fiscal 2016 presentation. Revenue Recognition
Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and
 the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment orupon
 receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and onlinestore
 revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated andrecorded
 as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that areexpected
 to be granted to certain customers at a later date. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identificationof
 outstanding  claims  and  outstanding  returns  not  yet  received  from  customers  and  (3)  estimated  discounts,  returns  and  claims  expected,  but  not  yet  finalized  withcustomers.
 As of May  31, 2016 and 2015 ,  the Company’s reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $789  million and $724million 
, respectively. Cost of Sales
Cost
 of sales consists  primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedgegains and losses and research, design and development costs. Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in 
Cost of sales . Operating Overhead Expense
Operating overhead expense 
consists primarily of payroll and benefit related costs, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and meetings and travel. Demand Creation Expense
Demand
 creation expense consists  of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events andretail
 brand  presentation.  Advertising  production  costs  are  expensed  the  first  time  an  advertisement  is  run.  Advertising  communication  costs  are  expensed  when  theadvertisement
 appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation iscompleted and delivered.
A
 significant  amount  of  the  Company’s  promotional  expenses  result  from  payments  under  endorsement  contracts.  Accounting  for  endorsement  payments  is  based  uponspecific
 contract  provisions.  Generally,  endorsement  payments  are  expensed  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  contract  after  giving  recognition  to  periodicperformance
 compliance provisions of the contracts. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid  expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxesand other assets 
depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Certain
 contracts  provide  for  contingent  payments  to  endorsers  based  upon  specific  achievements  in  their  sports  (e.g.,  winning  a  championship).  The  Company  recordsdemand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.
Certain
 contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining aspecified
 ranking  in  a  sport  for  a  year).  When  the  Company  determines  payments  are  probable,  the  amounts  are  reported  in Demand  creation expense ratably  over  thecontract
 period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from the Company'sestimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance, increased or decreased demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.
54

Table of ContentsCertain
 contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments inCost of sales 
as  the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which the Company estimates it willnot
 meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earnedthrough sales of product in 
Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term. Through
 cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses retail customers for certain costs of advertising the Company’s products. The Company records thesecosts in 
Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs . This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run.Total
 advertising and promotion expenses were $3,278  million , $3,213 million and $3,031 million for  the years ended May  31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,  respectively. Prepaidadvertising and
 promotion expenses totaled $540 million and $455 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively, and were recorded in Prepaid  expenses and other currentassets 
and Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies. Cash and Equivalents
Cash
 and equivalents represent  cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market funds, time depositsand corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term
 investments consist  of  highly  liquid  investments,  including  commercial  paper,  U.S.  Treasury,  U.S.  Agency,  time  deposits  and  corporate  debt  securities,  withmaturities ove
r 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2016 
and 2015 , the Company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity. At 
May 31, 2016 and 2015 , Short-term investments consisted  of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains andlosses
 reported, net of tax, in Accumulated  other comprehensive income ,  unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses onthe
 sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months,as
 available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assetswithin 
Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to 
Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company’s short-term investments. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable, net 
consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and
 maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, theCompany
 considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accountsreceivable
 with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income
 taxes and other assets .  The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $43  million and $78 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015 ,  respectively, of which $17 million 
and $24 million , respectively, was classified as long-term and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets . Inventory Valuation
Inventories 
are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on either an avera ge or specific identification cost basis. For inventories in transit that represent direct shipments tocustomers,
 the  related  inventory  and  cost  of  sales  are  recognized  on  a  specific  identification  basis.  Inventory  costs  primarily  consist  of  product  cost  from  the  Company'ssuppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property,
 plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and formachinery and equipment over 
2 to 15 years.Depreciation
 and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost  of sales .  Depreciation and amortization of otherassets are recorded in 
Operating overhead expense . Software Development Costs
Internal
 Use Software :  Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 10 year period on astraight-line
 basis. The Company’s policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal usecomputer
 software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computersoftware
 projects.  The  amount  of  capitalizable  payroll  costs  with  respect  to  these  employees  is  limited  to  the  time  directly  spent  on  such  projects.  Costs  associated  withpreliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.
Computer
 Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed :  Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of aproduct
 are subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release tocustomers.
 In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurredsubsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

Table of ContentsImpairment of Long-Lived Assets
The
 Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carryingamount
 of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner inwhich
 an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observablemarket
 value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if thecarrying
 value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over theremaining
 economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Companywill
 estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairmentwould be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangi
ble AssetsThe
 Company  performs  annual  impairment  tests  on  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  lives  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year  or  when  events  occur  orcircumstances
 change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events orchanges
 in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reportingunit,
 planned  divestitures  or  an  expectation  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable,  among  other  factors.  The  Company  may  first  assess  qualitative  factors  todetermine whether it is
 more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, theCompany
 determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. Thetwo-step impairment
 test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill ofthat reporting unit is potentia
lly impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records animpairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.
The
 Company generally bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the marketvaluation
 approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that the Company expects thereporting
 unit to generate in the future. The Company's significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: its weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate ofgrowth
 and  profitability  of  the  reporting  unit's  business;  and  working  capital  effects.  The  market  valuation  approach  indicates  the  fair  value  of  the  business  based  on  acomparison
 of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model includeidentifying
 similar  companies  with  comparable  business  factors  such  as  size,  growth,  profitability,  risk  and  return  on  investment  and  assessing  comparable  revenue  andoperating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit.
Indefinite-l
ived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it ismore
 likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the C ompany determines that it is morelikely than
 not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculationis
 required for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extentthat
 their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for therelated brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.
Operating Leases
The
 Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating leaseagreements may contain rent esca
lation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating
 leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective leasecommencement
 date,  which  is  generally  the  date  in  which  the  Company  takes  possession  of  or  controls  the  physical  use  of  the  property.  Certain  leases  also  provide  forcontingent
 rent, which is determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expensewhen specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures certain
 financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price theCompany
 would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level
 hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the variousvaluation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach).
The levels of hierarchy are described below:
•
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. •
Level  2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets orliabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the
 fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset orliability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
56

Table of ContentsPricing
 vendors are utilized for certain Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputswithout
 applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals,volatilities
 and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricingcurves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties.
The
 Company’s fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include a comparison of fair values toanother independent pricing vendor.
Refer to 
Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactio
nsAdjustments
 resulting  from  translating  foreign  functional  currency  financial  statements  into  U.S.  Dollars  are  included  in  the  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment,  acomponent of 
Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders’ equity . The
 Company’s global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functionalcurrency.
 These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other  (income) expense, net ,  within the Consolidated Statements ofIncome.
Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities
The
 Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fairvalue
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated  other comprehensive income(a component of 
Total shareholders’ equity ), Long-term debt or Net income depending on  the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designatedas
 a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as thecash
 flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash  provided by operations component of the
 Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows.  For  designated  net  investment  hedges,  this  is  within  the Cash  used  by  investing  activities component  of  the  ConsolidatedStatements
 of Cash Flows. For the Company’s fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable tochanges
 in  interest  rates,  the  related  cash  flows  from  periodic  interest  payments  are  reflected  within  the Cash  provided  by  operations component  of  the  ConsolidatedStatements of Cash Flows. Refer to 
Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Company’s risk management program and derivatives. Stock-Based Compensation
The
 Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and employees’ purchase rights under theEmployee
 Stock Purchase Plans (“ESPPs”) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as Operating overhead expense 
in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Refer to 
Note 11 — Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for more information on the Company’s stock-based compensation programs. Income Taxes
The
 Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expectedfuture
 tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance toreduce deferred tax
 assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statementearnings of
 non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely inits non-U.S. operations.
The
 Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained uponexamination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in 
Income tax expense . Refer to 
Note 9 — Income Taxes for further discussion. Earnings Per Share
Basic
 earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by  the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings percommon share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.
Refer to Note 12 — Earnings Per Share for further discussion.
Management Estimates
The
 preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating toassumptions
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reportedamounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Table of ContentsRecently Adopted Accounting Standards
In
 November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income  Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to  simplify the presentation of deferredtaxes in the
 statement of financial position. The updated guidance requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. TheCompany
 elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 on a retrospective basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The adoption of this standard reduced Total  current assets by $389million 
, increased Deferred income taxes and other assets by $386 million and reduced Total current liabilities and Deferred income taxes and other liabilities by $2 million and $1 million 
, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2015. Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In
 May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updatedguidance requi
res companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration towhich
 the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount,timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Based on the FASB's decision in July 2015 to defer the effective date and to allowmore
 flexibility with implementation, the new standard will be effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018, with early application permitted. The new standard is requiredto
 be  applied  retrospectively  to  each  prior  reporting  period  presented  or  retrospectively  with  the  cumulative  effect  of  initially  applying  it  recognized  at  the  date  of  initialapplication. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect
 the guidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In
 January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial  Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and FinancialLiabilities 
.  The  updated  guidance  enhances  the  reporting  model  for  financial  instruments,  which  includes  amendments  to  address  aspects  of  recognition,  measurement,presentation
 and disclosure. The update to the standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a materialimpact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In
 February  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2016-02, Leases  (Topic  842) that  replaces  existing  lease  guidance.  The  new  standard  is  intended  to  provide  enhancedtransparency
 and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance will continue toclassify
 leases  as  either  finance  or  operating,  with  classification  affecting  the  pattern  of  expense  recognition  in  the  statement  of  income.  The  standard  is  effective  for  theCompany
 beginning June 1, 2019, with early application permitted. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reportingperiod presented with optional practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Weighted average interest rate includes non-interest bearing overdrafts. The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for 
Notes payable approximate fair value. The Company purchases thr
ough Sojitz America certain NIKE Brand products it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for products sold in certain countries inthe
 Company's Emerging Markets geographic operating segment and Canada, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Accounts payable to Sojitz Americaare
 generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60 -day London Interbank Offered Rate(“LIBOR”) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date,
 plus 0.75% . As of 
May 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company had no amounts outstanding under its $2 billion commercial paper program. On
 August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2  billion of  borrowings. The facilitymatures
 August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022.Based
 on the Company’s current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively,the
 interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.455% .  The facility fee is 0.045% of the  total commitment. Under this committedcredit
 facility, the Company must maintain certain financial ratios, among other things, with which the Company was in compliance at May  31, 2016 .  This facility replaces theprior 
$1  billion credit  facility  agreement  entered  into  on  November  1,  2011,  which  would  have  matured  November  1,  2017. No amounts  were  outstanding  under  eithercommitted credit facility as of

These senior unsecured obligations rank equally with the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. (2)
The  Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby the Company receives fixed interest payments at the same rate as the note and pays variableinterest payments based on the 
six -month LIBOR plus a spread. The swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding note. On October 15,2015,
 the Company repaid the long-term debt which had previously been hedged with these interest rate swaps. Accordingly, as of May  31, 2016 ,  the Company had nointerest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges.

The  bonds are redeemable at the Company's option prior to February 1, 2023 and November 1, 2042, respectively, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of  theaggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of 
the remaining scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaidinterest. Subsequent to February 1,
 2023 and November 1, 2042, respectively, the bonds also feature a par call provision, which allows for the bonds to be redeemed at aprice equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
(4)
The  bonds are redeemable at the Company's option prior to May 1, 2045, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of  the aggregate principal amount of the notes to beredeemed
 or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. Subsequent to May 1, 2045, thebonds
 also  feature  a  par  call  provision,  which  allows  for  the  bonds  to  be  redeemed  at  a  price  equal  to  100%  of  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  notes  beingredeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
(5)
The Company assumed a total of $59 million in bonds payable as  part of its agreement to purchase certain Corporate properties; this was treated as a non-cash financingtransaction. The property serves as collateral for the debt. The
 purchase of these properties was accounted for as a business combination where the total consideration of$85 million 
was allocated  to the land and buildings acquired; no other tangible or intangible assets or liabilities resulted from the purchase. The bonds mature in 2017 and2018
 and the Company does not have the ability to re-negotiate the terms of the debt agreements and would incur significant financial penalties if the notes were paid-offprior to maturity. During the year ended 
May 31, 2016 , the notes due January 1, 2018 were legally defeased and an insignificant loss on defeasance was recognized. (6)
NIKE  Logistics YK assumed a total of ¥13.0  billion in  loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution center in Japan, which serves as collateral for the loans.These loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period 
August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020 . The
 scheduled  maturity  of Long-term  debt in  each  of  the  years  ending  May  31, 2017 through 2021 are $44  million , $6  million , $6  million , $6  million and $3  million , respectively, at face value.
The Company's 
Long-term debt is recorded at  adjusted cost, net of unamortized premiums and discounts and interest rate swap fair value adjustments. The fair value of Long- term debt 
is estimated based upon quoted prices for similar instruments or quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets (Level 2). The fair  value of the Company’sLong-term debt 
, including the current portion, was approximately $2,125 million at May 31, 2016 and $1,160 million at May 31, 2015 . 62

The
 effective tax rate for the year ended May  31, 2015 was 180 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May  31, 2014 primarily  due to the favorableresolution of audits in several jurisdictions.

 $506  $438  $506 (1)
During  the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, the Company reached a resolution with the IRS on a U.S. Unilateral Advanced Pricing Agreement thatcovers
 intercompany transfer pricing for fiscal years 2011 through 2020. As a result, the Company recorded a gross increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to priorperiod
 tax positions, a gross decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior period tax positions and a settlement. The net impact of these items resulted in adecrease to unrecognized tax benefits.
As
 of May  31, 2016 ,  total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $506  million , $290 million of  which would affect the Company'seffective tax rate if recognized in future periods.
The
 Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income  tax expense .  The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased by $45 million 
during  the year ended May 31, 2016 , decreased by $3 million during  the year ended May 31, 2015 and increased by $55 million during  the year ended May 31, 2014 . As of 
May 31, 2016 and 2015 , accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $209 million and $164 million , respectively (excluding federal benefit). The
 Company incurs tax liabilities primarily in the United States, China and the Netherlands, as well as various state and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currentlyunder audit
 by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for fiscal years 2013 through 2015 .  The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2012,with
 the exception of the validation of foreign tax credits utilized. During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company received from the IRS a statutory notice of deficiency forfiscal
 2012, proposing an increase in tax of $223 million ,  subject to interest, related to the foreign tax credit matter. The Company intends to contest this deficiency notice. Aspreviously disc
losed, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency for fiscal 2011, proposing an increase in tax of $31 million , subject to interest, related to the foreign tax
 credit matter. This notice also reported a decrease in foreign tax credit carryovers for fiscal 2010 and 2011. The Company has contested this deficiency notice by filing apetition with
 the U.S Tax Court in April 2015. The Company does not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material impact on the financial statements. No payments onthe assessment would be required until the dispute is
 definitively resolved. Based on the information currently available, the Company does not anticipate a significant increaseor decrease to its unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within the next 12 months.

Table of ContentsThe
 Company’s  major  foreign  jurisdictions,  China  and  the  Netherlands,  have  concluded  substantially  all  income  tax  matters  through  calendar  2005  and  fiscal  2010,respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in 
the aggregate, along with the expiration ofapplicable
 statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $92  million within  the next 12months.
The
 Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.At 
May 31, 2016 ,  the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided were approximately $10.7 billion . If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States or
 if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, they would generateforeign
 tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. Assuming a full utilization of the foreigntax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings would be approximately 
$3.6 billion at May 31, 2016 . A
 portion of the Company's foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021 .  This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions aremet
 or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign taxes by $173 million , $174 million and $138 million for the fiscal years ended 
May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The benefit of the tax  holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.10 , $0.10 and $0.08 for the fiscal years ended 
May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Deferred
 tax assets at May  31, 2016 and 2015 were  reduced by a valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of certain subsidiaries with operating losses. There was a $43 million 
net increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended May 31, 2016 , compared to no net change and a net increase of $4 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 
2014 , respectively. The Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of 
$143 million at May 31, 2016 . Such losses will expire as follows:

NOTE 11 — Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation
The
 authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 400  million and 2,400 million ,  respectively. Each share
 of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting  rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances withrespect
 to  the  election  of  directors.  There  are  no  differences  in  the  dividend  and  liquidation  preferences  or  participation  rights  of  the  Class  A  and  Class  B  commonshareholders.
The

 stock options and other awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentivestock
 options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciationrights may
 not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan. Thecommittee
 has  the  authority  to  determine  the  employees  to  whom  awards  will  be  made,  the  amount  of  the  awards  and  the  other  terms  and  conditions  of  the  awards.Substantially
 all stock option grants outstanding under the Stock Incentive Plan are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant.

 weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May  31, 2016 was 6.0 years and 4.6 years, respectively. The aggregateintrinsic
 value for options outstanding and exercisable at May  31, 2016 was $2,806 million and $2,242 million ,  respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount bywhich
 the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2016 
, 2015 and 2014 was $946 million , $795 million and $474 million , respectively. In
 addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans(“ESPPs”).
 Employees  are  eligible  to  participate  through  payroll  deductions  of  up  to 10% of  their  compensation.  At  the  end  of  each 6 -month  offering  period,  shares  arepurchased by
 the participants at 85% of  the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 2.5 million , 2.7 million and 2.8 million 
shares during each of the three years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. From
 time to time, the Company grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to key employees under the Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares underlying suchawards granted to employees during the years ended 
May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were 1 million , 0.5 million and 0.6 million , respectively, with weighted average values per share
 of $54.87 , $39.69 and $31.94 ,  respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period ofrestriction.
 Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stockunits
 was established  by the market price on the date of grant.  During the years ended May  31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,  the aggregate fair value of restricted stock andrestricted
 stock units vested was $49  million , $20 million and $28 million ,  respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. As of May  31, 2016 ,  the Company had $62 million 
of unrecognized compensation costs  from restricted stock and restricted stock units to be recognized in Operating overhead expense over a weighted average period of 2.8 
years.66

Table of ContentsIn
 connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage forlegal
 issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on theCompany’s
 historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to theCompany’s financial position or results of operations.
In
 the  ordinary  course  of  its  business,  the  Company  is  involved  in  various  legal  proceedings  involving  contractual  and  employment  relationships,  product  liability  claims,trademark
 rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe anycurrently
 identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position orcash flows.
NOTE 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives
The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect
 of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financialexposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
The
 Company  may  elect  to  designate  certain  derivatives  as  hedging  instruments  under  the  accounting  standards  for  derivatives  and  hedging.  The  Company  formallydocuments
 all  relationships  between  designated  hedging  instruments  and  hedged  items  as  well  as  its  risk  management  objectives  and  strategies  for  undertaking  hedgetransactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions.
The
 majority  of  derivatives  outstanding  as  of May  31,  2016 are  designated as  foreign  currency  cash  flow  hedges,  primarily  for  Euro/U.S.  Dollar,  British  Pound/Euro  andJapanese
 Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs . All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instrument’s maturitydate.

All  interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly,changes
 in the fair values of the interest  rate swaps are considered  to exactly  offset  changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term  debt.  Refer to “Fair ValueHedges” in this note for additional detail.

Accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 
2015 and 2014 . Cash Flow Hedges
The
 purpose  of the Company's  foreign exchange risk management  program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects  of currency fluctuations  on the Company'sconsolidated
 results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures that the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costexposures, non-functional
 currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.
Product
 cost  exposures  are  primarily  generated  through  non-functional  currency  denominated  product  purchases  and  the  foreign  currency  adjustment  program  describedbelow.
 NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase  product from the NIKE Trading Company (“NTC”), a wholly owned sourcinghub
 that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product toNIKE
 entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for theNTC. (2)
 Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entitieswith a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.
The
 Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assumingcertain
 of  the  factories’  foreign  currency  exposures,  some  of  which  are  natural  offsets  to  the  Company's  existing  foreign  currency  exposures.  Under  this  program,  theCompany’s
 payments  to these factories  are adjusted for rate fluctuations  in the basket of currencies (“factory currency  exposure index”) in which the labor, materials andoverhead
 costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in thelocal or functiona
l currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollarand
 the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory’s acceptance of NIKE’s purchase order. Embedded derivativecontracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.
The
 Company’s policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed.Typically, the
 Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of
 the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The  total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $11.5 billion 
 as of May 31, 2016 . 70

Table of ContentsAs of 
May  31, 2016 ,  the Company had a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total outstanding notional amount of $1.5 billion . These instruments were
 designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates. Duringthe
 second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company terminated certain forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1 billion in  connection with the October29,
 2015 debt issuance (refer to Note  8 — Long-Term Debt ).  Upon termination of these forward-starting swaps, the Company received a cash payment from the relatedcounterparties
 of $34  million ,  which  was  recorded  in Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income and  will  be  released  through Interest  expense  (income),  net as  interestpayments are made over the term of the issued debt.
All changes in fair
 value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive income  until  Net income 
 is  affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases, amounts recorded in  Accumulated  other comprehensive income  will  be releasedto
  Net income  in  periods following the maturity of the related derivative, rather than at maturity. Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements ofIncome
 in  the  same  manner  as  the  underlying  exposure.  The  results  of  hedges  of  non-functional  currency  denominated  revenues  and  product  cost  exposures,  excludingembedded
 derivatives, are recorded in Revenues or Cost of sales when  the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated Net income .  Results of hedges of selling andadministrat
ive expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. Amounts recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive income  related to
 forward-starting interest rate swaps will be released through  Interest  expense (income), net  as  interest payments are made over the term of the issued debt. Results ofhedges
 of anticipated purchases and sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in Other  (income) expense, net when  the securities are sold.Results
 of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in  Other  (income) expense, net when  the transaction occurs. The Company classifies thecash
 flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the Cash provided by operations 
component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Premiums paid or rece
ived on options are initially recorded as deferred charges or deferred credits, respectively. The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based onthe total cash flows method and records total changes in the options’ fair value to 
Accumulated other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective. The
 Company formally assesses, both at a hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highlyeffective
 in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Effectiveness forcash flow hedges is assessed based on changes in forward rates 
. Ineffectiveness was 0 billion for the years ended May 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . The
 Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (1) it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of ahedged
 item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; (3) it is no longerprobable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.
When the
 Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expectedto
 occur within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in Accumulated  other comprehensive income and  is reclassified toNet income 
when  the forecasted transaction affects consolidated Net income .  However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originallyspecified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately
 in Other  (income) expense, net .  In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry thederivative at its
 fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recognizing future changes in the fair value in Other (income) expense, net . For the years ended May 31, 2016 , 
2015 and 2014 ,  the amounts recorded in Other  (income) expense, net as  a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was nolonger probable of occurring were 
immaterial . As of 
May  31, 2016 , $460 million of  deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated  other comprehensive income are expected to be
 reclassified to Net  income during  the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net  income .  Actual amounts ultimatelyreclassified
 to Net  income are  dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of May  31, 2016 ,  the maximumterm over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 
24 months.Fair Value Hedges
The
 Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company tohedge
 this risk are receive-fixed,  pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated  as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcutmethod
 requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactlyoffset
 changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The cash flows associated with the Company’s fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while theswaps
 are outstanding, which are reflected within the Cash  provided by operations component  of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The  Company recorded no ineffectiveness
 from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May  31, 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .  On October 15, 2015, the Company repaid thelong-term
 debt which had previously been hedged with these interest rate swaps. Accordingly, a s  of May 31, 2016 ,  the Company had  no interest rate swaps designated asfair value hedges.
Net Investment Hedges
The
 Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned internationaloperations.
 All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in Accumulated  other comprehensiveincome 
along  with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges withinthe 
Cash used by investing activities component  of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forwardrates.
 The  Company  recorded no ineffectiveness  from  net  investment  hedges  for  the  years  ended May  31, 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . The Company had no outstanding netinvestment hedges as of 
May 31, 2016 . 71

Table of ContentsUndesignated Derivative Instruments
The Company may elect
 to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and/or the embeddedderivative
 contracts. These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, these undesignatedinstruments
 are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in  Other (income)
 expense, net ,  together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract. The Company classifies thecash
 flows  at  settlement  from  undesignated  instruments  in  the  same  category  as  the  cash  flows  from  the  related  hedged  items,  primarily  within  the Cash  provided  byoperations 
component  of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was  $7.1  billion  as  of May 31, 2016 
. Embedded Derivatives
As
 part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory’s acceptance of NIKE’s purchase order forcurrencies
 within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. Embedded derivative contracts aretreated as
 foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets
 with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in  Other (income) expense, net ,  from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through thedate the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations.
In
 addition, the Company has entered into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency ofeither
 substantial party to the contracts. These payment terms expose NIKE to variability in foreign exchange rates and create embedded derivative contracts that must bebifurcated
 from the related contract and recorded at fair value as derivative  assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding changes in fairvalue recognized in  
Other (income) expense, net until each payment is settled. At 
May 31, 2016 , the notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $282 million . Credit Risk
The Company is exposed to
 credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions aremajor financial institutions with investment grade credit
 ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Company’s exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk islimited
 to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strictcounterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
The
 Company’s derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties’ creditworthiness andtheir
 ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company’s bilateral credit related contingent features generally require theowing
 entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50  million should  the fair value of outstandingderivatives
 per counterparty be greater than $50  million . Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also triggercollateral
 requirements. As of  May  31, 2016 ,  the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and had derivative instruments with credit risk-related
 contingent features in a net liability position of $3  million . Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features.Further,
 as of  May  31, 2016 ,  the Company had received  $105 million  of  cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to  Note  6 — Fair ValueMeasurements 
). Given the considerations described above, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default  to be immaterial . NOTE 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information
The
 Company’s operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions foroperations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each
 NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment.The
 Company’s  reportable  operating  segments  for  the  NIKE  Brand  are:  North  America,  Western  Europe,  Central  &  Eastern  Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  EmergingMarkets,
 and  include  results  for  the  NIKE,  Jordan  and  Hurley  brands.  The  Company’s  NIKE  Brand  Direct  to  Consumer  operations  are  managed  within  each  geographicoperating
 segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers,apparel and accessories.
Global
 Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarilyrepresent
 NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and designexpenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand.
Corporate
 consists  largely  of  unallocated  general  and  administrative  expenses,  including  expenses  associated  with  centrally  managed  departments;  depreciation  andamortization
 related to the Company’s headquarters;  unallocated  insurance,  benefit  and compensation  programs, including stock-based  compensation;  and certain foreigncurrency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.
72

Table of ContentsThe
 primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as“EBIT”), which represents 
Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As
 part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brandentity
 in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasonsto
 which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summerselling
 seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for  geographic operatingsegments
 and  Converse  reflect  use  of  these  standard  rates  to  record  non-functional  currency  product  purchases  in  the  entity’s  functional  currency.  Differences  betweenassigned
 standard  foreign  currency  rates  and  actual  market  rates  are  included  in  Corporate,  together  with  foreign  currency  hedge  gains  and  losses  generated  from  theCompany's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.
Accounts receivable, net 
, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to 
fiscal 2016 presentation. 73

Exhibit 10.17COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE
PARTIES;
Andrew Campion ("EMPLOYEE")
and
NIKE, Inc. and its parent, divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns. ("NIKE")
RECITALS:
A.
This  Covenant Not to Compete ("Agreement") is executed upon initial employment with NIKE and is a condition ofsuch
 employment or is executed upon the EMPLOYEE's bona fide advancement with NIKE and is a condition ofsuch
 advancement  and continued  employment. Employee  acknowledges that he/she  was informed  in a  written joboffer
 at least two weeks before starting work in his/her new position that he/she must enter into this Agreement as acondition of employment.
B.
Over the  course of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE, EMPLOYEE will be or has been exposed to and/or is in aposition
 to develop "Confidential Information" (as that term is defined in Nike's standard "Employee Invention andSecrecy
 Agreement")  peculiar  to NIKE's  business  and not generally  known  to the public.  EMPLOYEE  and NIKEfurther
 agree  and  anticipate  that  EMPLOYEE  will  continue  to  be  exposed  to  Protected  Information  of  greatersensitivity
 as EMPLOYEE's responsibilities change over time, including changes to EMPLOYEE's job, transfers intoother
 jobs that require exposure to Protected Information, or advancement in the company. This Agreement and itsenforceability
 shall continue to apply notwithstanding any changes in EMPLOYEE'S duties, responsibilities, positionor title at NIKE, and may only be superseded by a new written agreement executed by the parties.
C.
The  nature  of  NIKE's  business  is  both  global  and  highly  competitive,  and  disclosure  or  unauthorized  use  of  anyConfidential
 Information would result in severe damage to NIKE that would be difficult to measure. Accordingly,EMPLOYEE
 has  executed,  or  will  execute  together  with  this  Covenant  Not  to  Compete,  a  copy  of  the  EmployeeInvention
 and  Secrecy  Agreement,  which  sets  forth  EMPLOYEE's  obligations  to  protect  such  ConfidentialInformation, as well as other terms relating to protection of Nike's inventions.
AGREEMENT:
In consideration of the foregoing, and the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows:
1.
Covenant Not to Compete . (a)
Competition  Restriction . During EMPLOYEE's employment by NIKE, under the terms of any employment contract orotherwise,
 and  for  one  (1)  year  thereafter  (the  "Restriction  Period"),  EMPLOYEE  will  not  directly  or  indirectly  own,manage, control or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be employed

by, consult for or be connected in any manner with, any business engaged anywhere in the world in the athletic footwear,athletic
 apparel or sports equipment, sports electronics/technology and sports accessories business or any other business thatdirectly
 competes with the then-current existing or reasonably anticipated business of NIKE or any of its parent, subsidiariesor
 affiliated  corporations  (a  "Competitor").  This  provision  is  subject  to  NIKE's  option  to  waive  all  or  any  portion  of  theRestriction Period as more specifically provided below.
(b)
Extension  of  Time . In  the  event  EMPLOYEE  breaches  this  covenant  not  to  compete,  the  Restriction  Period  shallautomatically
 toll from the date of the first breach, and all subsequent breaches, until the resolution of the breach throughprivate
 settlement, judicial or other action, including all appeals. The Restriction Period shall continue upon the effectivedate
 of  any  such  settlement,  judicial  or  other  resolution.  NIKE  shall  not  be  obligated  to  pay  EMPLOYEE  the  additionalcompensation
 described  in  paragraph  1  (d)  below  during  any  period  of  time  in  which  this  Agreement  is  tolled  due  toEMPLOYEE's
 breach. In the event EMPLOYEE receives such additional compensation after any such breach, EMPLOYEEmust immediately reimburse NIKE in the amount of all such compensation upon the receipt of a written request by NIKE.
(c)
Waiver  of Non-Compete . NIKE has the option, in its sole discretion, to elect to waive all or a portion of the RestrictionPeriod
 or to limit the definition of Competitor, by giving EMPLOYEE seven (7) days' prior notice of such election. In theevent
 all  or  a  portion  of  the  Restriction  Period  is  waived  or  the  definition  of  Competitor  is  limited,  NIKE  shall  not  beobligated to pay EMPLOYEE for any period of time as to which the covenant not to compete has been waived. 
     ·(d)
Additional  Consideration . As  additional  consideration  for  the  covenant  not  to  compete  described  above,  should  NIKEterminate
 EMPLOYEE's employment without cause (as defined below) and elect to enforce the non-competition agreement,while
 the  Restriction  Period  is  in  effect  NIKE  shall  pay  EMPLOYEE  a  monthly  payment  equal  to  one  hundred  percent(100%)
 of  EMPLOYEE's  last  monthly  base  salary,  less  applicable  tax  withholdings.  Except  where  prohibited  by  law,  ifNIKE
 terminates EMPLOYEE for cause, no additional consideration will be owed to EMPLOYEE under this Agreement,and
 the  covenant  not  to  compete  will  remain  enforceable.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement  only,  "cause"  shall  mean  (i)insubordination;
 (ii)  acts  of  dishonesty;  (iii)  involvement  in  illegal  activities  where  such  involvement  in  illegal  activitiesviolates NIKE
 policies, places NIKE at risk or has or could damage NIKE's reputation in the community or any of its relatedor
 subsidiary  companies;  (iv)  violation  of  NIKE's  anti-harassment  or  anti-discrimination  policy;  or  (v)  gross  neglect  ofEMPLOYEE's
 duties  or  willful  misconduct  that,  in  either  case,  results  in  economic  harm  to  NIKE  or  harm  to  NIKE'sreputation.
 Nothing  in  this  paragraph  or  Agreement  alters  the  employment-at-will  relationship  between  NIKE  andEMPLOYEE.
If
 EMPLOYEE  voluntarily  terminates  employment  and  NIKE  elects  to  enforce  the  non-competitionagreement,
 while the Restriction Period is in effect NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to the greater offifty
 percent (50%) of EMPLOYEE's last monthly base salary or the equivalent of one-twelfth (1/12) of fifty percent of themedian
 family income for a four-person family in the state where EMPLOYEE resides, as determined by the United StatesCensus
 Bureau for the most recent year available at the time of EMPLOYEE's termination, less applicable tax withholdings.The first payment to
 EMPLOYEE of additional consideration shall follow on the last business day of the month after NIKE'selection to enforce the non-

competition agreement. Subsequent payments during the Restriction Period shall be payable monthly on the last businessday of the month in accordance with NIKE's payroll practices.
(e)
Withholding  and Offset . NIKE reserves the right to withhold from Additional Consideration payable to EMPLOYEE allfederal, state and
 local taxes as shall be required, as well as any other amounts authorized or required by NIKE policy. NIKEreserves
 the  right,  exercisable  in  its  sole  discretion,  to  reduce  the  amount  of  Additional  Consideration  by  amounts  thatEMPLOYEE
 owes  NIKE,  including  but  not  limited  to  any  payments  due  to  NIKE  in  accordance  with  the  NIKE  TaxEqualization
 Policy if EMPLOYEE is employed as a transferee during his or her employment with NIKE, and EMPLOYEEhereby
 authorizes such a reduction. EMPLOYEE agrees that notwithstanding the amount of any withholding and/or offset,even
 in an amount that reduces payments of Additional Consideration to zero dollars ($0.00), the covenant not to competewill
 remain enforceable. To the extent withholding or offset does not extinguish amounts that EMPLOYEE owes to NIKE,Employee remains obligated for the balance of the amounts owed.
2.
Subsequent Employer . EMPLOYEE agrees to notify NIKE at the time of separation of employment of the name of EMPLOYEE'snew
 employer,  if  known.  EMPLOYEE  further  agrees  to  disclose  to  NIKE  the  name  of  any  subsequent  employer  during  theRestriction Period, wherever located and regardless of whether such employer is a Competitor.
3.
Accounting of Profits . EMPLOYEE agrees that, if EMPLOYEE should violate any term of this Agreement, NIKE shall be entitledto
 an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, commissions, remuneration or benefits that EMPLOYEE directly orindirectly
 has  realized  and/or  may  realize  as  a  result  of  or  in  connection  with  any  such  violation  (including  the  return  of  anyadditional
 consideration paid by NIKE pursuant to paragraph l (d) above). Such remedy shall be in addition to and not in limitationof any injunctive relief or other rights or remedies to which NIKE may be entitled at law or in equity.
4.
General Provisions . (a)
Survival . This Agreement shall continue in effect after the termination of EMPLOYEE's employment, regardless of thereason for termination.
(b)
Waiver . No waiver, amendment, modification or cancellation of any term or condition of this Agreement will be effectiveunless
 executed in writing by both parties. No written waiver will excuse the performance of any act other than the act oracts specifically referred to therein.
(c)
Severability . Each provision herein will be treated as a separate and independent clause, and unenforceability of any oneclause will in no way impact the enforceability of any other clause. Should any of the provisions in this Agreement be found
to be unreasonable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be enforceable to the maximum extent
enforceable by the law of that jurisdiction.
(d)
Applicable Law/Jurisdiction . This Agreement, and EMPLOYEE's employment hereunder, shall be construed according tothe
 laws  of  the  state  of  Oregon.  EMPLOYEE  further  hereby  submits  to  the  jurisdiction  of,  and  agrees  that  exclusivejurisdiction
 over and venue for any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall lie in the state andfederal courts located in Oregon.
