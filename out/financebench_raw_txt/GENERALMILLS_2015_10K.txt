COMPANY OVERVIEW

branded and unbranded food products to the North Am erican foodservice and commercial baking industries . We manufacture our products in 
16 countries and market them in more than 100 count ries. In addition to our consolidated operations, w e have 50 percent interests in two 
strategic joint ventures that manufacture and marke t food products sold in more than 130 countries wor ldwide.  
We offer a variety of food products that provide gr eat taste, nutrition, convenience and value for con sumers around the world, with a focus on 
five large global categories:  
   
   
   
   
   
Other significant product categories include:

Customers. Our primary customers are grocery stores, mass merc handisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount 
chains, commercial and noncommercial foodservice di stributors and operators, restaurants, and convenie nce stores. We generally sell to these 
customers through our direct sales force. We use br oker and distribution arrangements for certain prod ucts or to serve certain types of 
customers. For further information on our customer credit and product return practices, please refer t o Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this report.  
During fiscal 2015, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its a ffiliates (Wal-Mart) accounted for 21 percent of ou r consolidated net sales and 30 percent of 
our net sales in the U.S. Retail segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our co nsolidated net sales. Wal-Mart also 
represented 7 percent of our net sales in the Inter national segment and 9 percent of our net sales in the Convenience Stores and Foodservice 
segment. As of May 31, 2015, Wal- Mart accounted for 29 percent of our U.S. Retail re ceivables, 6 percent of our International receivabl es, and 
9 percent of our Convenience Stores and Foodservice  receivables. The five largest customers in our U.S . Retail segment accounted for 54 
percent of its fiscal 2015 net sales, the five larg est customers in our International segment accounte d for 24 percent of its fiscal 2015 net sales, 
and the five largest customers in our Convenience S tores and Foodservice segment accounted for 44 perc ent of its fiscal 2015 net sales.  
Competition. The consumer foods industry is highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the  United States and 
throughout the world. The food categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our princ ipal competitors in these categories all 
have substantial financial, marketing, and other re sources. Competition in our product categories is b ased on product innovation, product 
quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effe ctiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and t he ability to identify and satisfy consumer 
preferences. Our principal strategies for competing  in each of our segments include unique consumer in sights, effective customer relationships, 
superior product quality, innovative advertising, p roduct promotion, product innovation aligned with c onsumers’ needs, an efficient supply 
chain, and price. In most product categories, we co mpete not only with other widely advertised, brande d products, but also with regional brands 
and with generic and private label products that ar e generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and 
local manufacturers, and each country includes a un ique group of competitors.  
Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging. The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), sugar, dairy products, 
vegetables, fruits, meats, vegetable oils, and othe r agricultural products. We also use substantial qu antities of carton board, corrugated, plastic 
and metal packaging materials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic a nd Canadian operations are purchased 
from suppliers in the United States. In our interna tional operations, inputs that are not locally avai lable in adequate supply may be imported 
from other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as  weather, product scarcity, limited sources 
of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultu ral and energy policies and regulations. 
We have some long- term fixed price contracts, but the majority of our  inputs are purchased on the open market. We believ e that we will be able 
to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occa sionally and where possible, we make advance purcha ses of items significant to our 
business in order to ensure continuity of operation s. Our objective is to procure materials meeting bo th our quality standards and our production 
needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our 
products, to the extent possible, we often manage t he risk associated with adverse price movements for  some inputs using a variety of risk 
management strategies. We also have a grain merchan dising operation that provides us efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of, 
various commodity markets, principally wheat and oa ts. This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at fair market value and uses 
derivatives to manage its net inventory position an d minimize its market exposures.  
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  
Our research and development resources are focused on new product development, product improvement, pr ocess design and improvement, 
packaging, and exploratory research in new business  and technology areas. Research and development exp enditures were $229 million in fiscal 
2015, $244 million in fiscal 2014, and $238 million  in fiscal 2013.

to its franchisees. The Liberté trademark and other related trademarks are owned by  Liberté Marques Sàrl, an entity in which we own a 50 
percent interest.  
We continue our focus on developing and marketing i nnovative, proprietary products. We consider the co llective rights under our various 
patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable  asset, but we do not believe that our businesses a re materially dependent upon any single 
patent or group of related patents.  
SEASONALITY  
In general, demand for our products is evenly balan ced throughout the year. However, within our U.S. R etail segment demand for refrigerated 
dough, frozen baked goods, and baking products is s tronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for Progresso soup and Green Giant 
canned and frozen vegetables is higher during the f all and winter months. Internationally, demand for Häagen-Dazs ice cream is higher during 
the summer months and demand for baking mix and dou gh products increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these 
demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our Internat ional segment net sales are generally 
evenly balanced throughout the year.  
BACKLOG  
Orders are generally filled within a few days of re ceipt and are subject to cancellation at any time p rior to shipment. The backlog of any 
unfilled orders as of May 31, 2015, was not materia l.

described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial S tatements in Item 8 of this report.  
EMPLOYEES  
As of May 31, 2015, we had approximately 42,000 ful l- and part-time employees.  
FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION  
The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our acti vities are subject to regulation by various 
federal government agencies, including the Food and  Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Fe deral Trade Commission, 
Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protectio n Agency, as well as various state and local agenci es. Our business is also regulated by 
similar agencies outside of the United States.  
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  
As of May 31, 2015, we were involved with two activ e cleanup sites associated with the alleged or thre atened release of hazardous substances 
or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moo nachie, New Jersey. These matters involve several d ifferent actions, including 
administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies and private parties.  
Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Cl ean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery A ct, Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act , and all similar state, local, and 
foreign environmental laws and regulations applicab le to the jurisdictions in which we operate.  
Based on current facts and circumstances, we believ e that neither the results of our environmental pro ceedings nor our compliance in general

Our business is subject to various risks and uncert ainties. Any of the risks described below could mat erially, adversely affect our business, 
financial condition, and results of operations.  
The food categories in which we participate are ver y competitive, and if we are not able to compete ef fectively, our results of operations 
could be adversely affected.  
The food categories in which we participate are ver y competitive. Our principal competitors in these c ategories all have substantial financial, 
marketing, and other resources. In most product cat egories, we compete not only with other widely adve rtised branded products, but also with 
regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. C ompetition in our product categories is 
based on product innovation, product quality, price , brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of m arketing, promotional activity, and the 
ability to identify and satisfy consumer preference s. If our large competitors were to seek an advanta ge through pricing or promotional changes, 
we could choose to do the same, which could adverse ly affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market 
share could be adversely affected. Our market share  and revenue growth could also be adversely impacte d if we are not successful in 
introducing innovative products in response to chan ging consumer demands or by new product introductio ns of our competitors. If we are 
unable to build and sustain brand equity by offerin g recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over 
generic and private label products.  
We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.  
There has been significant consolidation in the gro cery industry, resulting in customers with increase d purchasing power. In addition, large 
retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved effici ency, lower pricing, increased reliance on 
their own brand name products, increased emphasis o n generic and other economy brands, and increased p romotional programs. If we are 
unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, produ ct innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and c ategory leadership positions to respond 
to these demands, our profitability and volume grow th could be negatively impacted. In addition, the l oss of any large customer for an extended 
length of time could adversely affect our sales and  profits. For more information on significant custo mers, please see Company Overview in 
Item 1 of this report.  
Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability.  
The principal raw materials that we use are commodi ties that experience price volatility caused by ext ernal conditions such as weather, product 
scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity mark et fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes  in governmental agricultural and energy 
policies and regulations. Commodity price changes m ay result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are 
unable to increase productivity to offset these inc reased costs or increase our prices, we may experie nce reduced margins and profitability. We 
do not fully hedge against changes in commodity pri ces, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we 
intend.

Volatility in the market value of derivatives we us e to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our 
gross margins and net earnings.  
We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for som e of our principal ingredient and energy costs, inc luding grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils 
(principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas,  and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these de rivatives are recorded in earnings currently, 
resulting in volatility in both gross margin and ne t earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements 
of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items in o ur segment operating results until we utilize the u nderlying input in our manufacturing 
process, at which time the gains and losses are rec lassified to segment operating profit. We also reco rd our grain inventories at fair value. We 
may experience volatile earnings as a result of the se accounting treatments.  
If we are not efficient in our production, our prof itability could suffer as a result of the highly co mpetitive environment in which we 
operate.  
Our future success and earnings growth depend in pa rt on our ability to be efficient in the production  and manufacture of our products in highly 
competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencie s may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity 
gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting f rom acquisitions or divestitures could adversely af fect our profitability and weaken our 
competitive position. Many productivity initiatives  involve complex reorganization of manufacturing fa cilities and production lines. Such 
manufacturing realignment may result in the interru ption of production, which may negatively impact pr oduct volume and margins. We are 
currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring  and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we 
are unable to execute those initiatives as planned,  we may not realize all or any of the anticipated b enefits, which could adversely affect our 
business and results of operations.  
Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affe ct our business.  
Our ability to make, move, and sell products is cri tical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw m aterial supplies or our manufacturing or 
distribution capabilities due to weather, including  any potential effects of climate change, natural d isaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, 
pandemic, strikes, import restrictions, or other fa ctors could impair our ability to manufacture or se ll our products. Failure to take adequate 
steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impac t of such events, or to effectively manage such eve nts if they occur, particularly when a 
product is sourced from a single supplier or locati on, could adversely affect our business and results  of operations, as well as require additional 
resources to restore our supply chain.  
Concerns with the safety and quality of food produc ts could cause consumers to avoid certain food prod ucts or ingredients.  
We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and  quality of certain food products or 
ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of  concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage con sumers from buying our products or 
cause production and delivery disruptions.  
If our food products become adulterated, misbranded , or mislabeled, we might need to recall those item s and may experience product 
liability claims if consumers are injured.  
We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A wi despread product recall could result in 
significant losses due to the costs of a recall, th e destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period 
of time. We could also suffer losses from a signifi cant product liability judgment against us. A signi ficant product recall or product liability 
case could also result in adverse publicity, damage  to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confiden ce in our food products, which could have 
an adverse effect on our business results and the v alue of our brands.  
We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in decreas ed demand for our products.  
Our success depends in part on our ability to antic ipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and  to offer products that appeal to their 
preferences. Consumer preferences and category-leve l consumption may change from

time to time and can be affected by a number of dif ferent trends and other factors. If we fail to anti cipate, identify or react to these changes and 
trends, or to introduce new and improved products o n a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn 
cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Sim ilarly, demand for our products could be affected b y consumer concerns regarding the health 
effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wh eat, or other product ingredients or 
attributes.  
We may be unable to grow our market share or add pr oducts that are in faster growing and more profitab le categories.  
The food industry’s growth potential is constrained  by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business 
faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to  enhance our portfolio by adding 
innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also  depend on our ability to increase market 
share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for n ew and existing categories, our growth 
may slow, which could adversely affect our profitab ility.  
Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.  
The willingness of consumers to purchase our produc ts depends in part on local economic conditions. In  periods of economic uncertainty, 
consumers may purchase more generic, private label,  and other economy brands and may forego certain pu rchases altogether. In those 
circumstances, we could experience a reduction in s ales of higher margin products or a shift in our pr oduct mix to lower margin offerings. In 
addition, as a result of economic conditions or com petitive actions, we may be unable to raise our pri ces sufficiently to protect margins. 
Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that t hey consume away from home at customers that purcha se products from our Convenience 
Stores and Foodservice segment. Any of these events  could have an adverse effect on our results of ope rations.  
Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers  do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.  
Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success o f our business. The value of our brands is 
based in large part on the degree to which consumer s react and respond positively to these brands. Bra nd value could diminish significantly due 
to a number of factors, including consumer percepti on that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, a dverse publicity about our products, our 
failure to maintain the quality of our products, th e failure of our products to deliver consistently p ositive consumer experiences, concerns about 
food safety, or our products becoming unavailable t o consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third 
parties increases the speed and extent that informa tion or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our 
brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. I f we do not maintain the favorable 
perception of our brands, our business results coul d be negatively impacted.  
Our international operations are subject to politic al and economic risks.  
In fiscal 2015, 29 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of 
risks relating to doing business internationally, a ny of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:  
   
   
10  •   political and economic instability;  
•   exchange controls and currency exchange rates;  
•   nationalization of operations;  
•   compliance with anti -corruption regulations;  
•   foreign tax treaties and policies; and  
•   restriction on the transfer of funds to and from fo reign countries, including potentially negative tax  consequences.

Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denomina ted basis is subject to fluctuations in currency ex change rates. These fluctuations could 
cause material variations in our results of operati ons. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, 
Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese y en, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to tim e, we enter into agreements that are 
intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to c urrency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our 
exposure.  
New regulations or regulatory-based claims could ad versely affect our business.  
Our facilities and products are subject to many law s and regulations administered by the United States  Department of Agriculture, the Federal 
Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safe ty and Health Administration, and other federal, st ate, local, and foreign governmental 
agencies relating to the production, packaging, sto rage, distribution, quality, and safety of food pro ducts and the health and safety of our 
employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and  regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administ rative penalties, and civil remedies, 
including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our pr oducts. We advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or 
deceptive advertising under federal, state, and for eign laws and regulations. We may also be subject t o new laws or regulations restricting our 
right to advertise our products, including proposal s to limit advertising to children. Changes in laws  or regulations that impose additional 
regulatory requirements on us could increase our co st of doing business or restrict our actions, causi ng our results of operations to be adversely 
affected.  
We are subject to various federal, state, local, an d foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our f ailure to comply with environmental laws 
and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, admin istrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are cur rently party to a variety of environmental 
remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexi ties, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the  risk of unidentified contaminants on 
current and former properties of ours, the potentia l exists for remediation, liability, indemnificatio n, and compliance costs to differ from our 
estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in re lation to these matters, or compliance with environ mental laws in general, will not exceed 
our established liabilities or otherwise have an ad verse effect on our business and results of operati ons.  
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which  could limit financing and other options and in som e cases adversely affect our 
ability to pay dividends.  
As of May 31, 2015, we had total debt, redeemable i nterests, and noncontrolling interests of $10.4 bil lion. The agreements under which we 
have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from inc urring additional unsecured indebtedness in the fut ure. Our level of indebtedness may limit 
our:  
   
There are various financial covenants and other res trictions in our debt instruments and noncontrollin g interests. If we fail to comply with any 
of these requirements, the related indebtedness (an d other unrelated indebtedness) could become due an d payable prior to its stated maturity 
and our ability to obtain additional or alternative  financing may also be adversely affected.  
Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to ref inance our debt and other obligations will depend o n our operating and financial 
performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing  economic conditions and to financial, business, an d other factors beyond our control.  
   
11  •   ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate  purposes, particularly if the ratings 
assigned to our debt securities by rating organizat ions were revised downward; and  
•   flexibility to adjust to changing business and mark et conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic 
conditions.

Global capital and credit market issues could negat ively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of b orrowing, and disrupt the 
operations of our suppliers and customers.  
We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning c apital and credit markets to fund our operations. A lthough we believe that our operating 
cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and  credit markets, and revolving credit agreements wi ll permit us to meet our financing needs for 
the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance t hat future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity 
or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize  interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility  of our financing costs. If we are not effective 
in hedging this volatility, we may experience an in crease in our costs of borrowing. Our business coul d also be negatively impacted if our 
suppliers or customers experience disruptions resul ting from tighter capital and credit markets or a s lowdown in the general economy.  
Volatility in the securities markets, interest rate s, and other factors could substantially increase o ur defined benefit pension, other 
postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.  
We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for em ployees in the United States, Canada, and various f oreign locations, including defined 
benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severa nce, and other postemployment plans. Our major defi ned benefit pension plans are funded 
with trust assets invested in a globally diversifie d portfolio of securities and other investments. Ch anges in interest rates, mortality rates, health 
care costs, early retirement rates, investment retu rns, and the market value of plan assets can affect  the funded status of our defined benefit 
plans and cause volatility in the net periodic bene fit cost and future funding requirements of the pla ns. A significant increase in our obligations 
or future funding requirements could have a negativ e impact on our results of operations and cash flow s from operations.  
Our business operations could be disrupted if our i nformation technology systems fail to perform adequ ately or are breached.  
Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our busine ss. We rely on information technology 
networks and systems, including the internet, to pr ocess, transmit, and store electronic information t o manage a variety of business processes 
and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requi rements. Our information technology systems and inf rastructure are critical to effectively 
manage our key business processes including digital  marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply cha in management, finance, administration, 
and other business processes. These technologies en able internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, 
customers, and others and include the receipt and s torage of personal information about our employees and proprietary business information. 
Our information technology systems, some of which a re dependent on services provided by third parties,  may be vulnerable to damage, 
interruption, or shutdown due to any number of caus es such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, 
telecommunications failures, security breaches, com puter viruses, hackers, and other causes. Increased  cyber-security threats pose a potential 
risk to the security and viability of our informati on technology systems, as well as the confidentiali ty, integrity, and availability of the data 
stored on those systems. The failure of our informa tion technology systems to perform as we anticipate  could disrupt our business and result in 
transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data  loss, and the loss of sales and customers. Any int erruption of our information technology 
systems could have operational, reputational, legal , and financial impacts that may have a material ad verse effect on our business.  
A change in the assumptions regarding the future pe rformance of our businesses or a different weighted -average cost of capital used to 
value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived i ntangible assets could negatively affect our consol idated results of operations and net 
worth.  
As of May 31, 2015, we had $13.1 billion of goodwil l and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested 
for impairment annually and whenever events or chan ges in circumstances indicate that impairment may h ave occurred. We compare the 
carrying value of the net assets of a reporting uni t, including goodwill, to the fair value of the uni t. If the fair value of the net assets of the 
reporting unit is less than the net assets includin g goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a 
discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our lo ng-range planning process. We also 
make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth  assumptions, market comparables, and other factors .

While we currently believe that our goodwill is not  impaired, different assumptions regarding the futu re performance of our businesses could 
result in significant impairment losses.  
We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible asse ts, primarily intangible assets associated with the  Pillsbury , Totino’s , Progresso , Green 
Giant , Yoplait , Old El Paso , Yoki , Häagen-Dazs , and Annie’s brands, to determine if they are finite or indefini te-lived. Reaching a 
determination on useful life requires significant j udgments and assumptions regarding the future effec ts of obsolescence, demand, competition, 
other economic factors (such as the stability of th e industry, known technological advances, legislati ve action that results in an uncertain or 
changing regulatory environment, and expected chang es in distribution channels), the level of required  maintenance expenditures, and the 
expected lives of other related groups of assets.  
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tes ted for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our es timate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs 
including projected revenues from our long-range pl an, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if  we did not own the brands, and a 
discount rate. Our Green Giant , Uncle Toby’s , and Mountain High brands have experienced declining business performa nce, and we will 
continue to monitor these businesses. For further i nformation on goodwill and intangible assets, pleas e refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.  
Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect  our financial results.  
From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitio ns or joint ventures that would further our strateg ic objectives. Our success depends, in part, 
upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing  operations. If we are unable to successfully integ rate acquisitions, our financial results could 
suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the 
acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabil ities, the inherent risk associated with entering a  geographic area or line of business in 
which we have no or limited prior experience, failu re to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impair ment of goodwill or other acquisition-
related intangible assets.

We own our principal executive offices and main res earch facilities, which are located in the Minneapo lis, Minnesota metropolitan area. We 
operate numerous manufacturing facilities and maint ain many sales and administrative offices, warehous es, and distribution centers around the 
world.  
As of May 31, 2015, we operated 66 facilities for t he production of a wide variety of food products. O f these facilities, 34 are located in the 
United States (1 of which is leased), 7 in the Asia /Pacific region (2 of which are leased), 5 in Canad a (3 of which are leased), 11 in 
Europe/Australia (2 of which are leased), and 9 in Latin America and Mexico. The following is a list o f the locations of our principal

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  
We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market th em under unique brand names. We 
work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolvin g needs and preferences. In addition, 
we build the equity of our brands over time with st rong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new pr oducts, and effective merchandising. 
We believe our brand-building strategy is the key t o winning and sustaining leading share positions in  markets around the globe.  
Our fundamental financial goal is to generate super ior returns for our stockholders over the long term . We believe that increases in net sales, 
segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS),  and return on average total capital are the key dr ivers of financial performance for our 
business.  
Our long-term growth objectives are to consistently  deliver:  
   
   
   
   
We believe that this financial performance, coupled  with an attractive dividend yield, should result i n long-term value creation for stockholders. 
We return a substantial amount of cash to stockhold ers through dividends and share repurchases.  
Our fiscal 2015 performance was mixed. Our two smal ler operating segments delivered growth. Operating profit for the Convenience Stores 
and Foodservice segment increased 15 percent to an all-time high of $353 million. Operating results fo r the International segment were muted 
by a significant negative impact from foreign curre ncy exchange and slowing economic growth in key eme rging markets, but the segment 
achieved good margin expansion and profit growth in  constant currency. Results for our U.S. Retail seg ment were disappointing, as both net 
sales and segment operating profit declined. Our br ands achieved share gains in categories representin g 65 percent of our products’ sales in 
measured U.S. retail channels, but overall sales tr ends in many categories were weak, reflecting the i mpact of changing consumer food 
preferences.  
Our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ende d May 31, 2015, declined 2 percent to $17.6 billion , as unfavorable foreign exchange offset 
the benefits of a 53 week and six months of increme ntal contribution from the Annie’s Inc. (Annie’s) n atural and organic foods business 
acquired in October 2014. On a constant-currency ba sis, net sales increased 1 percent. Total segment o perating profit of $3.0 billion declined 4 
percent and 2 percent in constant currency. Diluted  EPS declined 30 percent to $1.97 per share. Adjust ed diluted EPS, which excludes certain 
items affecting comparability of results, rose 1 pe rcent to $2.86 per share and increased 4 percent on  a constant-currency basis. These results 
were in line with our expectations which were revis ed in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our return  on average total capital declined 40 basis 
points to 11.2 percent. (See the “Non-GAAP Measures ” section below for discussion of total segment ope rating profit, adjusted diluted EPS, 
constant-currency nets sales growth rates, constant -currency total segment operating profit growth rat e, constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS 
growth rate, and return on average total capital, w hich are not defined by generally accepted accounti ng principles (GAAP)).  
Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.5 billio n in fiscal 2015. This cash generation supported ca pital investments totaling $712 million in 
fiscal 2015. We also returned significant cash to s tockholders through an 8 percent dividend increase,  and share repurchases totaling $1.2 
billion.  
We recorded the following achievements related to o ur other key operating objectives for fiscal 2015:  
   
   
17  ITEM 7 Management ’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition an d Results of Operations 
•   low single -digit annual growth in net sales;  
•   mid single -digit annual growth in total segment operating prof it;  
•   high single -digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certai n items affecting comparability; and  
•   improvement in return on average total capital.  
•   Product improvements on established brands and new- product introductions designed to respond to evolvi ng consumer food preferences 
generated good growth for a variety of our product lines. Examples included renewed sales growth for o ur U.S. Yogurt operating unit; 
strong sales contributions from protein -enriched  rd

cereal varieties; robust consumer demand across int ernational markets for new Old El Paso Mexican food  items; and double-digit growth 
for our U.S. portfolio of natural and organic food products.  
   
   
   
   
   
A detailed review of our fiscal 2015 performance ap pears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2015 Cons olidated Results of Operations.”  
Our sales and earnings growth targets for fiscal 20 16 reflect the impact of one less week compared to fiscal 2015. The Annie’s business will 
contribute 6 months of incremental results. We expe ct foreign currency exchange will continue to have a negative impact on reported results 
for our international operations, and we expect the  operating environment in our large developing mark ets (China and Brazil) to remain 
uncertain. We estimate our input cost inflation for  fiscal 2016 at 2 percent. With these assumptions i n mind:  
   
   
   
   
Certain terms used throughout this report are defin ed in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.  
   
18  •   The acquisition of Annie’s in October 2014 signific antly expanded our scale and participation in the a ttractive U.S. natural and organic 
food category. Combined net sales in the U.S. for o ur portfolio of natural and organic brands exceeded  $570 million in fiscal 2015.  
•   We increased our share of U.S. cereal category meas ured dollar sales.  
•   We increased our share of U.S. yogurt category meas ured dollar sales, including strong gains in the Gr eek yogurt segment, and renewed 
sales growth in the regular and child yogurt segmen ts. Our international yogurt operations expanded to  China with first production and 
order shipments to the Shanghai market commencing n ear the end of the fiscal year.  
•   We generated strong levels of supply chain producti vity savings in 2015 through our ongoing Holistic M argin Management (HMM) 
efforts. Beyond this program, we began several new cost savings initiatives during the fiscal year. Pr oject Century is our effort to simplify 
our North American supply chain. Project Catalyst i s focused on increasing the agility and effectivene ss of our U.S. Retail and corporate 
organizations, and we are making changes to various  corporate policies and practices to reduce overhea d expense. Together, these three 
initiatives generated more than $75 million in cost  savings during fiscal 2015, and they are expected to produce a cumulative $260 to 
$280 million in savings in fiscal 2016.  
•   We delivered strong cash returns to stockholders th rough dividends of $1.67 per share and share repurc hases totaling $1.2 billion. Share 
repurchase activity in fiscal 2015 and 2014 reduced  the average number of diluted shares outstanding i n fiscal 2015 by 4 percent from 
fiscal 2014.  
•   We expect fiscal 2016 net sales to essentially matc h 2015 levels in constant currency, reflecting the impact of one less week of business.  
•   We expect fiscal 2016 total segment operating profi t to increase at a low-single-digit rate in constan t currency, as HMM and our more 
recent cost -saving initiatives increase our efficiency and impr ove margins.  
•   We expect fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted EPS to incre ase at a mid -single -digit rate in constant currency.  
•   Our fiscal 2016 plans call for continued strong cas h returns to stockholders. The current annualized d ividend rate of $1.76 per share is up 
5 percent from the annual dividend paid in 2015. Sh are repurchases in fiscal 2016 are expected to resu lt in a net reduction in average 
diluted shares outstanding of approximately 1 perce nt.

FISCAL 2015 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
Fiscal 2015 had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fi scal 2014.  
Fiscal 2015 net sales declined 2 percent to $17,630  million and increased 1 percent on a constant-curr ency basis. In fiscal 2015, net earnings 
attributable to General Mills were $1,221 million, down 33 percent from $1,824 mi llion in fiscal 2014, and we reported diluted EPS of 
$1.97 in fiscal 2015, down 30 percent from $2.83 in  fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 results include restructu ring-related charges, an indefinite-lived 
intangible asset impairment charge, tax impact of t he repatriation of foreign earnings, losses from th e mark-to-market valuation of certain 
commodity positions and grain inventories, integrat ion costs resulting from the acquisition of Annie’s , and the impact of Venezuela currency 
devaluation. Fiscal 2014 results include the impact  of Venezuela currency devaluation, a gain on the d ivestiture of certain grain elevators, 
losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain  commodity positions and grain inventories, and res tructuring charges related to our fiscal 
2012 productivity and cost savings plan. Diluted EP S excluding these items affecting comparability tot aled $2.86 in fiscal 2015, up 1 percent 
from $2.82 in fiscal 2014. Diluted EPS excluding ce rtain items affecting comparability on a constant-c urrency basis increased 4 percent 
compared to fiscal 2014 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures ” section below for a description of our use of the se measures not defined by GAAP).  
Net sales declined 2 percent to $17,630 million in fiscal 201 5 from $17,910 in fiscal 2014. The components of ne t sales growth are shown in 
the following table:  
   
The 53 week in fiscal 2015 contributed approximatel y 1 percentage point of net sales growth, reflectin g 1 percentage point of growth from 
volume.  
Cost of sales increased $141 million in fiscal 2015 to $11,681 mi llion. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $90 million ne t increase in cost of sales 
related to mark-to-market valuation of certain comm odity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of $49 million in fiscal 2014. In fisc al 2015, we recorded $60 million of 
restructuring charges in cost of sales. Product mix  drove a $17 million increase in cost of sales. We also recorded a $3 million foreign exchange 
loss in fiscal 2015 related to Venezuela currency d evaluation compared to a $23 million loss in fiscal  2014. Lower volume drove a $68 million 
decrease in cost of sales.  
We also expect to incur approximately $65 million o f restructuring initiative project-related cash cos ts and recorded $13 million of these costs 
in cost of sales in fiscal 2015 (please refer to No te 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in It em 8 of this report).  
Gross margin declined 7 percent in fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 201 4. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 34 per cent decreased 190 basis 
points compared to fiscal 2014.  
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses  decreased $146 million in fiscal 2015 versus fiscal  2014 primarily due to a 5 percent 
decrease in advertising and media expense, and savi ngs from Project Catalyst (please refer to Note 4 t o the Consolidated Financial Statements 
in Item 8 of this report) and our other cost manage ment initiatives. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $5 million charge related to Venezuela 
currency devaluation compared to a $39 million char ge in fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded $16 mil lion of integration costs in fiscal 2015 
related to our acquisition of Annie’s. SG&A expense s as a percent of net sales decreased 50 basis poin ts compared to fiscal 2014.

Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $544 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $4 million in fiscal 2014.  
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we made a  strategic decision to redirect certain resources s upporting our Green Giant business in our 
U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. As a result, we recorded a $260 million im pairment charge in the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2015 related to the Green Giant brand intangible asset.  
Restructuring charges recorded in restructuring, im pairment, and other exit costs were $284 million in  fiscal 2015 compared to $4 million in 
fiscal 2014. Total charges associated with our rest ructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2015 and  2014 consisted of the following:  
   
(a) Includes $59.6 million of restructuring charges  recorded in cost of sales during fiscal 2015.  
(b) Cumulative annual savings estimated by fiscal 2 017. Includes savings from SG&A cost reduction proj ects.  
Please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financia l Statements in Item 8 of this report for more info rmation regarding our restructuring 
activities.  
There were no divestitures in fiscal 2015. During f iscal 2014, we recorded a divestiture gain of $66 million related to the sale of certain grain  
elevators in our U.S. Retail segment.  
Interest, net for fiscal 2015 totaled $315 million, $13 million h igher than fiscal 2014. Average interest bearing in struments increased $1,370 
million, generating a $55 million increase in net i nterest. The average interest rate decreased 47 bas is points, including the effect of the mix of 
debt, generating a $42 million decrease in net inte rest.  
Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 of 33.3 percent was consistent with  fiscal 2014. The 4.5 percentage point impact resul ting 
from the repatriation of $606 million of foreign ea rnings in fiscal 2015 was offset by changes in earn ings mix by country, certain favorable 
discrete items, and favorable state tax rate change s.

primarily due to the adoption of new mortality tabl es for the annual remeasurement of the obligations associated with these plans.  
Accounts payable increased $73 million from fiscal 2014, primarily d riven by the extension of payment terms and the tim ing of payments.  
Notes payable and long-term debt, including current portion, increased $438 million from fiscal 2014, primarily driven by $1,107 million of 
net long-term debt issuances, partially offset by n et commercial paper payments.

FISCAL 2014 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
Our consolidated results for fiscal 2014 include on e additional quarter of operating activity from the  acquisition of Yoki Alimentos S.A. (Yoki) 
in Brazil, one additional quarter of operating acti vity from the assumption of the Canadian Yoplait fr anchise license, and three additional 
quarters of operating activity from the acquisition  of Immaculate Baking Company in the United States.  Collectively, these items are referred to 
as “new businesses” in comparing our fiscal 2014 re sults to fiscal 2013.  
Fiscal 2014 net sales grew 1 percent to $17,910 mil lion including 1 percentage point of growth contrib uted by new businesses and 1 percentage 
point of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In fiscal 2014,  net earnings attributable to General Mills  were $1,824 million, down 2 
percent from $1,855 million in fiscal 2013, and we reported  diluted EPS  of $2.83 in fiscal 2014, up 1 percent from $2.79 i n fiscal 2013. 
Fiscal 2014 results include a gain on the divestitu re of certain grain elevators, the impact of Venezu ela currency devaluation, gains from the 
mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity posit ions and grain inventories, and restructuring charg es related to our fiscal 2012 
productivity and cost savings plan. Fiscal 2013 res ults include the effects from various discrete tax items, the impact of Venezuela currency 
devaluation, restructuring charges related to our f iscal 2012 productivity and cost savings plan, inte gration costs resulting from the acquisition 
of Yoki, and gains from the mark-to-market valuatio n of certain commodity positions and grain inventor ies. Diluted EPS excluding these items 
affecting comparability totaled $2.82 in fiscal 201 4, up 4 percent from $2.72 in fiscal 2013 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a 
description of our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).  
Net sales grew 1 percent in fiscal 2014 to $17,910 from $17,7 74 in fiscal 2013. The components of net sales grow th are shown in the following

Cost of sales  increased $190 million in fiscal 2014 to $11,540 m illion. Higher volume drove an $115 million increas e in cost of sales. Product 
mix also drove an $130 million increase in cost of sales. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a $49 million ne t decrease in cost of sales related to mark-
to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease o f $4 million in fiscal 2013. We also recorded a $23  million foreign exchange loss in fiscal 
2014 related to the Venezuela currency devaluation compared to a $16 million loss in fiscal 2013. In f iscal 2013, we also recorded a $17 
million non-recurring expense related to the assump tion of the Canadian Yoplait franchise license.  
Gross margin  declined 1 percent in fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 20 13. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 36 pe rcent was unchanged 
compared to fiscal 2013.  
SG&A expenses  decreased $78 million in fiscal 2014 versus fiscal  2013. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by a 3 percent 
decrease in advertising and media expense, a smalle r contribution to the General Mills Foundation, a d ecrease in incentive compensation 
expense, and lower pension expense compared to fisc al 2013. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a $39 million charge related to Venezuela currency 
devaluation compared to a $9 million charge in fisc al 2013. In addition, we recorded $12 million of in tegration costs in fiscal 2013 related to 
our acquisition of Yoki. SG&A expenses as a percent  of net sales decreased 1 percent compared to fisca l 2013.  
During fiscal 2014, we recorded a divestiture gain of $66 million related to the sale of certain grain  elevators in our U.S. Retail segment. 
There were no divestitures in fiscal 2013.  
Interest, net  for fiscal 2014 totaled $302 million, $15 million lower than fiscal 2013. The average interest rate d ecreased 41 basis points, 
including the effect of the mix of debt, generating  a $31 million decrease in net interest. Average in terest bearing instruments increased $367 
million, generating a $16 million increase in net i nterest.  
Our consolidated  effective tax rate  for fiscal 2014 was 33.3 percent compared to 29.2 percent in fiscal 2013. The 4.1 percentage point 
increase was primarily related to the restructuring  of our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiary  during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, 
which resulted in a $63 million decrease to deferre d income tax liabilities related to the tax basis o f the investment in GMC and certain 
distributed assets, with a corresponding non-cash r eduction to income taxes. During fiscal 2013, we al so recorded a $34 million discrete 
decrease in income tax expense and an increase in o ur deferred tax assets related to certain actions t aken to restore part of the tax benefits 
associated with Medicare Part D subsidies which had  previously been reduced in fiscal 2010 with the en actment of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Our fisca l 2013 tax expense also includes a 
$12 million charge associated with the liquidation of a corporate investment.  
After-tax earnings from joint ventures  for fiscal 2014 decreased to $90 million compared to $99 million in fiscal 2013 primarily driven by 
increased consumer spending at CPW and unfavorable foreign currency exchange from HDJ. The change in n et sales for each joint venture is 
set forth in the following table:

Average diluted shares outstanding  decreased by 20 million in fiscal 2014 from fiscal  2013 due primarily to the repurchase of 36 million  
shares, partially offset by the issuance of 7 milli on shares related to stock compensation plans.  
RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS  
Our businesses are organized into three operating s egments: U.S. Retail; International; and Convenienc e Stores and Foodservice.  
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we c hanged how we assess segment operating performance to exclude the asset and liability 
remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economi es. This impact is now included in unallocated corp orate items. All periods presented 
have been changed to conform to this presentation.  
The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from e ach segment for fiscal years 2015, 2014, 
and 2013:  
   
Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corpo rate items, gain on divestitures, and restructuring , impairment, and other exit costs because 
these items affecting operating profit are centrall y managed at the corporate level and are excluded f rom the measure of segment profitability 
reviewed by our executive management.

U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT  
Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2015, w e realigned certain operating units within our U.S.  Retail operating segment. We also 
changed the name of our Yoplait operating unit to Y ogurt and our Big G operating unit to Cereal. Froze n Foods transitioned into Meals and 
Baking Products. Small Planet Foods transitioned in to Snacks, Cereal, and Meals. The Yogurt operating unit was unchanged. We revised the 
amounts previously reported in the net sales and ne t sales percentage change by operating unit within our U.S. Retail segment to conform to the 
new operating unit structure. These realignments ha d no effect on previously reported consolidated net  sales, operating segments’ net sales, 
operating profit, segment operating profit, net ear nings attributable to General Mills, or EPS. In add ition, results from the acquired Annie’s 
business are included in the Meals and Snacks opera ting units.  
Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wi de variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, m embership stores, natural food chains, 
and drug, dollar and discount chains operating thro ughout the United States. Our product categories in  this business segment are ready-to-eat 
cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, shel f stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and fr ozen dough products, dessert and baking 
mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic pr oducts including meal kits, granola bars, 
and cereal.  
In fiscal 2015, net sales for our U.S. Retail segme nt were $10,507 million, down 1 percent compared to  fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014, net sales for 
this segment totaled $10,605 million, flat compared  to fiscal 2013. The components of U.S. Retail net sales growth are shown in the following

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS  
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we c hanged how we assess segment operating performance to exclude the asset and liability 
remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economi es. This impact is now included in unallocated corp orate items. All periods presented 
have been changed to conform to this presentation.  
Unallocated corporate items include corporate overh ead expenses, variances to planned domestic employe e benefits and incentives, 
contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asse t and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflat ionary economies, restructuring initiative 
project-related costs, and other items that are not  part of our measurement of segment operating perfo rmance. This includes gains and losses 
from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segmen ts in accordance with our policy as 
discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial S tatements in Item 8 of this report.  
For fiscal 2015, unallocated corporate expense tota led $414 million compared to $258 million last year . In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $90 
million net increase in expense related to mark-to- market valuation of certain commodity positions and  grain inventories, compared to a $49 
million net decrease in expense in fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded $60 million of restructuring charges, and $13 million of restructuring 
initiative project-related costs in cost of sales i n fiscal 2015. We recorded an $8 million foreign ex change loss related to the remeasurement of 
assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary  compared to $62 million in fiscal 2014. We also re corded $16 million of integration costs 
resulting from the acquisition of Annie’s in fiscal  2015.  
For fiscal 2014, unallocated corporate expense tota led $258 million compared to $351 million in fiscal  2013. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a $49 
million net decrease in expense related to mark-to- market valuation of certain commodity positions and  grain inventories, compared to a $4 
million net decrease in expense in the prior year. Compensation and benefit expenses decreased $59 mil lion and the contribution to the General 
Mills Foundation decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. We also recorded a $62 million fore ign exchange loss related to the 
remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Vene zuelan subsidiary in fiscal 2014 compared to $25 mi llion in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, we 
also recorded $12 million of integration costs rela ted to the acquisition of Yoki.

Table of Contents  
Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy, and we remeasure the value of the assets and liabilities o f our Venezuelan subsidiary based on the 
exchange rate at which we expect to remit dividends  in U.S. dollars. In February 2014, the Venezuelan government established a new foreign 
exchange market mechanism (SICAD 2) and at that tim e indicated that it would be the market through whi ch U.S. dollars would be obtained 
for the remittance of dividends. On February 12, 20 15, the Venezuelan government replaced SICAD 2 with  a new foreign exchange market 
mechanism (SIMADI). We expect to be able to access U.S. dollars through the SIMADI market. SIMADI has significantly higher foreign 
exchange rates than those available through the oth er foreign exchange mechanisms. In fiscal 2015, we recorded an $8 million foreign 
exchange loss in unallocated corporate items result ing from the remeasurement of assets and liabilitie s of our Venezuelan subsidiary at the 
SIMADI rate of 199 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Our Ve nezuela operations represent less than 1 percent of  our consolidated assets, liabilities, net 
sales, and segment operating profit. As of May 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million of non-U.S. dollar cash b alances in Venezuela.  
IMPACT OF INFLATION  
Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2015 reflect s the impact of 2 percent input cost inflation, pri marily on commodities inputs. We expect 
input cost inflation of 2 percent in fiscal 2016. W e attempt to minimize the effects of inflation thro ugh HMM, planning, and operating 
practices. Our risk management practices are discus sed in Item 7A of this report.  
LIQUIDITY  
The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow fr om operations. Over the most recent three-year peri od, our operations have generated $8.0 
billion in cash. A substantial portion of this oper ating cash flow has been returned to stockholders t hrough share repurchases and dividends. We 
also use cash from operations to fund our capital e xpenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a co mbination of cash, notes payable, and 
long-term debt to finance significant acquisitions and major capital expansions.  
As of May 31, 2015, we had $311 million of cash and  cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions whi ch will be used to fund foreign 
operations and acquisitions. During the fourth quar ter of fiscal 2015, we approved a one-time repatria tion of $606 million of foreign 
earnings. This action reduced the economic cost of funding current restructuring initiatives and the a cquisition of Annie’s completed in fiscal 
2015. We recorded a discrete income tax charge of $ 79 million in fiscal 2015 related to this action, a nd we expect to make approximately $24 
million in related cash income tax payments related  to this action. We have previously asserted that o ur foreign earnings are permanently 
reinvested and will only be repatriated in a tax-ne utral manner, and this one-time repatriation does n ot change this ongoing assertion.

In fiscal 2015, our operations generated $2.5 billi on of cash, flat compared to fiscal 2014. The $247 million change in current assets and 
liabilities was primarily driven by the timing of t rade and promotion accruals, changes in tax accrual s, and changes in derivative positions. This 
was largely offset by lower net earnings, which inc luded a $260 million non-cash impairment charge and  $271 million of non-cash 
restructuring charges, and a $147 million change in  net deferred income taxes.  
We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 201 5, core working capital decreased 13 
percent, primarily due to a decrease in accounts re ceivable and an increase in accounts payable, compa red to a net sales decline of 2 percent. In 
fiscal 2014, core working capital decreased 9 perce nt, compared to net sales growth of 1 percent, and in fiscal 2013, core working capital 
decreased 5 percent, compared to net sales growth o f 7 percent.  
In fiscal 2014, our operations generated $2.5 billi on of cash compared to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2013.  The $385 million decrease was primarily 
due to a $503 million change in current assets and liabilities. The change in current assets and liabi lities was primarily driven by a $403 million 
change in other current liabilities largely due to changes in trade promotion and income tax accruals,  and a $107 million change in inventory. In 
addition, in fiscal 2013 we made a $200 million vol untary contribution to our principal domestic pensi on plans.  
Cash Flows from Investing Activities  
   
In fiscal 2015, cash used by investing activities i ncreased by $1.0 billion from fiscal 2014. We inves ted $712 million in land, buildings, and 
equipment in fiscal 2015, $49 million more than the  same period last year. In the second quarter of fi scal 2015, we acquired Annie’ s, a publicly 
traded food company headquartered in Berkeley, Cali fornia, for an aggregate purchase price of $809 mil lion, net of $12 million of cash 
acquired. We made $102 million of investments in af filiates, primarily CPW, in fiscal 2015. In additio n, we received $28 million in payments 
from Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) in fiscal 2015  against the $132 million exchangeable note we purc hased in fiscal 2012.  
In fiscal 2014, cash used by investing activities d ecreased by $954 million from fiscal 2013. We inves ted $664 million in land, buildings, and 
equipment in fiscal 2014, $50 million more than in fiscal 2013. We made $55 million of investments in affiliates, primarily CPW, in fiscal 
2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold  certain grain elevators for $124 million in cash, including a working capital adjustment 
finalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. In a ddition we received $29 million in payments from So diaal in fiscal 2014 against the 
exchangeable note.  
We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $840 million in fiscal 2016. These expenditures wil l fund initiatives that are expected to 
fuel International growth, support innovative produ cts, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the su pply chain.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities  
   
Net cash used by financing activities decreased by $439 million in fiscal 2015. We had $204 million le ss net debt issuances in fiscal 2015 than 
the same period a year ago. For more information on  our debt issuances and payments, please refer to N ote 8 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this report.  
During fiscal 2015, we received $164 million in pro ceeds from common stock issued on exercised options  compared to $108 million in fiscal 
2014, an increase of $56 million. During fiscal 201 3, we received $301 million in proceeds from common  stock issued on exercised options.  
In May 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our commo n stock. Purchases under the 
authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the us e of call options and other derivative 
instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and acceler ated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date.  
During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 22 million share s of our common stock for $1,162 million. During fi scal 2014, we repurchased 36 million 
shares of our common stock for $1,745 million. Duri ng fiscal 2013, we repurchased 24 million shares of  our common stock for $1,015 million.  
Dividends paid in fiscal 2015 totaled $1,018 millio n, or $1.67 per share, an 8 percent per share incre ase from fiscal 2014. Dividends paid in 
fiscal 2014 totaled $983 million, or $1.55 per shar e, a 17 percent per share increase from fiscal 2013  dividends of $1.32 per share. On 
March 10, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 5  percent dividend increase, effective with the May 1, 2015 payment, to an annualized rate 
of $1.76 per share.

CAPITAL RESOURCES  
Total capital consisted of the following:  
   
The following table details the fee-paid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of  May 31, 2015:  
   
To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank c redit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding not es payable. Commercial paper is a 
continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the Un ited States and Europe. We also have 
uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that supp ort our foreign operations. The credit facilities c ontain several covenants, including a 
requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage rat io of at least 2.5 times.  
Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credi t facilities, and our noncontrolling interests cont ain restrictive covenants. As of May 31, 
2015, we were in compliance with all of these coven ants.  
We have $1,000 million of long-term debt maturing i n the next 12 months that is classified as current.  We believe that cash flows from 
operations, together with available short- and long -term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the 
next 12 months.  
As of May 31, 2015, our total debt, including the i mpact of derivative instruments designated as hedge s, was 72 percent in fixed-rate and 28 
percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 7 1 percent in fixed-rate and 29 percent in floating- rate instruments on May 25, 2014.  
Improvement in return on average total capital is o ne of our key performance measures (see the “Non-GA AP Measures” section below for our 
discussion of this measure, which is not defined by  GAAP). Return on average total capital decreased 4 0 basis points from 11.6 percent in 
fiscal 2014 to 11.2 percent in fiscal 2015 as fisca l 2015 earnings declined. On a constant-currency ba sis, return on average total capital 
decreased 20 basis points. We also believe that our  fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of opera ting cash flow to debt are important 
measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charg e coverage ratio in fiscal 2015 was 5.54 compared t o 8.04 in fiscal 2014. The measure 
decreased from fiscal 2014 as earnings before incom e taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased by $893 million including a 
$260 million non-cash pretax charge related to an i ndefinite-lived intangible

asset impairment and a $344 million pretax increase  in restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. Our opera ting cash flow to debt ratio decreased 1.3 
percentage points to 27.6 percent in fiscal 2015, d riven by an increase in total debt.  
We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplai t SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal 
holds the remaining interests in each of these enti ties. We consolidate these entities into our consol idated financial statements. We record 
Sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SN C and Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling intere sts, and their 49 percent interest in 
Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consoli dated Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian doll ar-denominated interests are reported 
in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion o f its redeemable interest to us at fair value 
once per year through a maximum term expiring Decem ber 2020. As of May 31, 2015, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 
$779 million which approximates its fair value.  
The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals , LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly pr eferred distributions from available net 
income based on the application of a floating prefe rred return rate, to the holder’s capital account b alance established in the most recent mark-
to-market valuation (currently $252 million). For f iscal 2015, the floating preferred rate was equal t o the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 110 
basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted  every three years through a negotiated agreement w ith the Class A Interest holder or through a 
remarketing auction. On June 1, 2015, subsequent to  our year-end, the floating preferred return rate o n GMC’s Class A Interests was reset to 
the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points.   
We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests  for consideration equal to the then current capita l account value, plus any unpaid preferred 
return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-p arty holder’s capital account from its 
original value will be charged directly to retained  earnings and will increase or decrease the net ear nings used to calculate EPS in that period.  
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLI GATIONS  
As of May 31, 2015, we have issued guarantees and c omfort letters of $434 million for the debt and oth er obligations of consolidated 
subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of  $258 million for the debt and other obligations of  non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. 
In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are gen erally limited to the future payments under non-can celable operating leases, which totaled 
$400 million as of May 31, 2015.  
As of May 31, 2015, we had invested in five variabl e interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are ma terial to our results of operations, 
financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the  year ended May 31, 2015.

considered purchase obligations if a contract speci fies all significant terms, including fixed or mini mum quantities to be purchased, a 
pricing structure, and approximate timing of the tr ansaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without  a significant penalty and with 
short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflect ed on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts p ayable and accrued liabilities are 
excluded from the table above. 
(d) The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity,  commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a p ayable position to the counterparty was 
$133 million as of May 31, 2015, based on fair mark et values as of that date. Future changes in market  values will impact the amount of 
cash ultimately paid or received to settle those in struments in the future. Other long-term obligation s mainly consist of liabilities for 
accrued compensation and benefits, including the un derfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement 
benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and misc ellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $22 million  of benefits from our unfunded 
postemployment benefit plans and $14 million of def erred compensation in fiscal 2016. We are unable to  reliably estimate the amount of 
these payments beyond fiscal 2016. As of May 31, 20 15, our total liability for uncertain tax positions  and accrued interest and penalties 
was $196 million.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  
For a complete description of our significant accou nting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Fina ncial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
Our significant accounting estimates are those that  have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our f inancial condition and results of 
operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-liv ed assets, intangible assets, redeemable 
interest, stock- based compensation, income taxes, and defined benef it pension, other postretirement benefit, and poste mployment benefit plans. 
Promotional Expenditures  
Our promotional activities are conducted through ou r customers and directly or indirectly with end con sumers. These activities include: 
payments to customers to perform merchandising acti vities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-sto re displays; discounts to our list prices to 
lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distrib ution of new products; coupons, contests, and other  incentives; and media and advertising 
expenditures. The recognition of these costs requir es estimation of customer participation and perform ance levels. These estimates are based on 
the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forec asted costs of promotional activities, and other fa ctors. Differences between estimated 
expenses and actual costs are recognized as a chang e in management estimate in a subsequent period. Ou r accrued trade, coupon, and consumer 
marketing liabilities were $565 million as of May 3 1, 2015, and $578 million as of May 25, 2014. Becau se our total promotional expenditures 
(including amounts classified as a reduction of rev enues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccu rate we would have to make adjustments in 
subsequent periods that could have a material effec t on our results of operations.  
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets  
We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets a nd make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flow s to review for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that th e carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is 
measured using discounted cash flows or independent  appraisals, as appropriate.  
Intangible Assets  
Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asse ts are not subject to amortization and are tested f or impairment annually and whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that im pairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair v alue for goodwill impairment testing are 
determined based on a discounted cash flow model. W e use inputs from our long-range planning process t o determine growth rates for sales 
and profits. We also make estimates of discount rat es, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparabl es, and other factors.  
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangibl e assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are f inite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a 
determination on useful life requires significant j udgments and assumptions regarding the future effec ts of obsolescence, demand, competition, 
other economic factors (such as the stability of th e industry, known technological advances, legislati ve action that results in an uncertain or 
changing regulatory environment, and expected chang es in distribution channels), the level of required  maintenance expenditures, and the 
expected lives of other related groups of assets. I ntangible assets that are deemed to have definite l ives are amortized on a straight-line basis, 
over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 t o 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our b rand assets is based on a discounted cash 
flow model using inputs which include projected rev enues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rat es that could be payable if we did not 
own the brands, and a discount rate.

Table of Contents  
As of May 31, 2015, we had $13.1 billion of goodwil l and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of 
each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that  those intangibles so classified will contribute in definitely to our cash flows, materially 
different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average c ost of capital (WACC) could result in 
significant impairment losses and amortization expe nse. We performed our fiscal 2015 assessment of our  intangible assets as of November 24, 
2014. As of our annual assessment date, there was n o impairment of any of our intangible assets as the ir related fair values were substantially in 
excess of the carrying values, except for the Mountain High , Uncle Toby’s, and Green Giant brands. The excess fair value above the carrying 
value of these brand assets were as follows:  
   
At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we  made a strategic decision to redirect certain reso urces supporting our Green Giant business in 
our U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. Therefore, future sales and profitabil ity projections in our long-range plan for 
this business declined. As a result of this trigger ing event, we performed an interim impairment asses sment of the Green Giant brand intangible 
asset as of May 31, 2015, and determined that the f air value of the brand asset no longer exceeded the  carrying value of the asset. Significant 
assumptions used in that assessment included our up dated long-range cash flow projections for the Gree n Giant business, an updated royalty 
rate, a WACC, and a tax rate. We recorded a $260 mi llion impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fi scal 2015 related to this asset.  
Our Green Giant , Uncle Toby’s and Mountain High brands have experienced declining business performa nce, and we will continue to monitor 
these businesses.  
Redeemable Interest  
During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we adjuste d the redemption value of Sodiaal’s redeemable inte rest in Yoplait SAS based on a 
discounted cash flow model. The significant assumpt ions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and 
profitability from our long-range plan, capital spe nding, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exc hange rates, and a discount rate. As of 
May 31, 2015, the redemption value of the redeemabl e interest was $779 million.  
Stock -based Compensation  
The valuation of stock options is a significant acc ounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a 
material impact on our financial statements. Annual ly, we make predictive assumptions regarding future  stock price volatility, employee 
exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeitu re rate. For more information on these assumptions,  please refer to Note 11 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this  report.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes opti on-pricing model were as follows:  
   
The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. T reasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at 
the time of grant. An increase in the expected term  by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant,  would increase the grant date fair value by 
2 percent. If all other assumptions are held consta nt, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2 015 volatility assumption would increase the 
grant date fair value of our fiscal 2015 option awa rds by 7 percent.  
To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-d ate fair value-based expense to final 
intrinsic values. However, these differences can im pact the classification of cash tax benefits realiz ed upon exercise of stock options, as 
explained in the following two paragraphs. Furtherm ore, historical data has a significant bearing on o ur forward-looking assumptions. 
Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in o ur assumptions, which could then 
significantly impact the year-over-year comparabili ty of stock-based compensation expense.  
Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exer cise or vesting of an award in excess of that previ ously recognized in earnings (referred to 
as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Cons olidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing ca sh flow. The actual impact on future 
years ’ financing cash flows will depend, in part, on the  volume of employee stock option exercises during a  particular year and the relationship 
between the exercise-date market value of the under lying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial 
reporting purposes.  
Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to addi tional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Bala nce Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits 
(amounts which are less than that previously recogn ized in earnings) are first offset against the cumu lative balance of windfall tax benefits, if 
any, and then charged directly to income tax expens e, potentially resulting in volatility in our conso lidated effective income tax rate. We 
calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax bene fits for the purpose of accounting for future short fall tax benefits and currently have 
sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to abso rb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do no t currently expect future earnings to be 
affected by this provision. However, as employee st ock option exercise behavior is not within our cont rol, it is possible that materially different 
reported results could occur if different assumptio ns or conditions were to prevail.  
Income Taxes  
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the re cognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positi ons. Accordingly, we recognize the 
amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 pe rcent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment 
related to the expected ultimate resolution of unce rtain tax positions will affect earnings in the qua rter of such change. For more information on 
income taxes, please refer to Note 14 to the Consol idated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this repor t.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benef it, and Postemployment Benefit Plans  
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many  employees in the United States, Canada, France, an d the United Kingdom. We also 
sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, 
we also provide accruable benefits to former or ina ctive employees in the United States, Canada, and M exico, and members of our Board of 
Directors, including severance and certain other be nefits payable upon death. Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
in Item 8 of this report for a description of our d efined benefit pension, other postretirement benefi t, and postemployment benefit plans.  
We recognize benefits provided during retirement or  following employment over the plan participants’ a ctive working lives. Accordingly, we 
make various assumptions to predict and measure cos ts and obligations many years prior to the settleme nt of our obligations. Assumptions that 
require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net perio dic benefit expense or income and 
accumulated benefit obligations include the long-te rm rates of return on plan assets, the interest rat es used to discount the obligations for our 
benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.  
Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets  
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is deter mined by our asset allocation, our historical long- term investment performance, our estimate 
of future long-term returns by asset class (using i nput from our actuaries, investment services, and i nvestment managers), and long-term 
inflation assumptions. We review this assumption an nually for each plan, however, our annual investmen t performance for one particular year 
does not, by itself, significantly influence our ev aluation.  
Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit  pension and other postretirement 
benefit plan assets were 6.5 percent, 11.7 percent,  8.1 percent, 7.8 percent, and 9.6 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended 
May 31, 2015.  
On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of r eturn for all defined benefit plans was 8.53 percen t for fiscal 2015, 8.53 percent for fiscal 
2014, and 8.53 percent for fiscal 2013.  
Lowering the expected long- term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points w ould increase our net pension and postretirement ex pense by $62 
million for fiscal 2016. A market-related valuation  basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volat ility. The market-related valuation 
recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occu r. Investment gains or losses for this 
purpose are the difference between the expected ret urn calculated using the market-related value of as sets and the actual return based on the 
market-related value of assets. Our outside actuari es perform these calculations as part of our determ ination of annual expense or income.  
Discount Rates  
Our discount rate assumptions are determined annual ly as of the last day of our fiscal year for our de fined benefit pension, other postretirement 
benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligation s. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected 
future cash outflows to plan participants and, usin g the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to deve lop a forward interest rate curve, 
including a margin to that index based on our credi t risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied  to our expected future cash outflows to 
determine our discount rate assumptions.

Table of Contents  
Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows :  
   
Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points wou ld increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and 
postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2016  by approximately $167 million. All obligation-rela ted experience gains and losses are 
amortized using a straight-line method over the ave rage remaining service period of active plan partic ipants.  
Health Care Cost Trend Rates  
We review our health care cost trend rates annually . Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and 
information provided by our actuaries. This informa tion includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and 
projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend r ate is adjusted as necessary to remain 
consistent with this review, recent experiences, an d short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.3 percent for 
retirees age 65 and over and 6.5 percent for retire es under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2015. Rates ar e graded down annually until the ultimate 
trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2025 for al l retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calc ulations only if the retirees’ benefits increase 
as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to a pproximate the current economic view on the 
rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate hea lth care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for heal th care costs have an important effect on 
the amounts reported for the other postretirement b enefit plans.  
A one percentage point change in the health care co st trend rate would have the following effects:  
   
Any arising health care claims cost-related experie nce gain or loss is recognized in the calculation o f expected future claims. Once recognized, 
experience gains and losses are amortized using a s traight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required 
being recorded.  
Financial Statement Impact  
In fiscal 2015, we recorded net defined benefit pen sion, other postretirement benefit, and postemploym ent benefit plan expense of $153 million 
compared to $140 million of expense in fiscal 2014 and $159 million of expense in fiscal 2013. As of M ay 31, 2015, we had cumulative 
unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.7 billion o n our defined benefit pension plans and $81 million  on our postretirement and 
postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, p artially offset by recent increases in the 
values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial  net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses 
because they currently exceed the corridors defined  by GAAP.

Assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payment s a participant will receive over their 
lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. On  October 27, 2014, the Society of Actuaries publish ed RP-2014 Mortality Tables and 
Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2014, which both ref lect improved longevity. We adopted the change to t he mortality assumptions to 
remeasure our defined benefit pension plans and oth er postretirement benefit plans obligations, which increased the total of these obligations by 
$437 million. In addition, these assumptions increa sed the fiscal 2016 expense associated with these p lans by $72 million.  
Actual future net defined benefit pension, other po stretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit pl an income or expense will depend on 
investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and  other factors related to the populations 
participating in these plans.  
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
In May 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Boa rd (FASB) issued new accounting requirements for th e presentation of certain 
investments using the net asset value, providing a practical expedient to exclude such investments fro m categorization within the fair value 
hierarchy and make a separate disclosure. The requi rements of the new standard are effective for annua l reporting periods beginning after 
December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those  annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We do not expect this 
guidance to have a material impact on our results o f operations or financial position.  
In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting requi rements that permit reporting entities with a fisca l year-end that does not coincide with a 
month-end to apply a practical expedient to measure  defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the 
entity’s fiscal year-end and apply the practice con sistently to all plans. The requirements of the new  standard are effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and inte rim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We 
do not expect this guidance to have a material impa ct on our results of operations or financial positi on.  
In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting require ments for the recognition of revenue from contracts  with customers. The requirements of 
the new standard are effective for annual reporting  periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and int erim periods within those annual 
periods, which for us is the first quarter of fisca l 2018. We do not expect this guidance to have a ma terial impact on our results of operations or 
financial position.  
In June 2014, the FASB issued new accounting requir ements for share-based payment awards issued based upon specific performance targets. 
The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after Decemb er 15, 2015, and interim periods within 
those annual periods, which for us is the first qua rter of fiscal 2017. We do not expect this guidance  to have a material impact on our results of 
operations or financial position.  
NON-GAAP MEASURES  
We have included in this report measures of financi al performance that are not defined by GAAP. We bel ieve that these measures provide 
useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors.  
For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we a re providing below a reconciliation of the differen ces between the non-GAAP measure 
and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an e xplanation of why our management or the Board of Di rectors believes the non-GAAP 
measure provides useful information to investors an d any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-
GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be vie wed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the compara ble GAAP measure.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING IN FORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF “SAFE 
HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGA TION REFORM ACT OF 1995  
This report contains or incorporates by reference f orward-looking statements within the meaning of the  Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995 that are based on our current expectati ons and assumptions. We also may make written or or al forward-looking statements, 
including statements contained in our filings with the SEC and in our reports to stockholders.  
The words or phrases “will likely result,” “are exp ected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “esti mate,” “plan,” “project,” or similar 
expressions identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litiga tion Reform Act of 1995. Such statements 
are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results to differ materially fr om historical results and those currently 
anticipated or projected. We wish to caution you no t to place undue reliance on any such forward-looki ng statements.  
In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 199 5, we are identifying important factors 
that could affect our financial performance and cou ld cause our actual results in future periods to di ffer materially from any current opinions or 
statements.  
Our future results could be affected by a variety o f factors, such as: competitive dynamics in the con sumer foods industry and the markets for 
our products, including new product introductions, advertising activities, pricing actions, and promot ional activities of our competitors; 
economic conditions, including changes in inflation  rates, interest rates, tax rates, or the availabil ity of capital; product development and 
innovation; consumer acceptance of new products and  product improvements; consumer reaction to pricing  actions and changes in promotion 
levels; acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets; changes in capital structure; changes in  the legal and regulatory environment, 
including labeling and advertising regulations and litigation; impairments in the carrying value of go odwill, other intangible assets, or other 
long-lived assets, or changes in the useful lives o f other intangible assets; changes in accounting st andards and the impact of significant 
accounting estimates; product quality and safety is sues, including recalls and product liability; chan ges in consumer demand for our products; 
effectiveness of advertising, marketing, and promot ional programs; changes in consumer behavior, trend s, and preferences, including weight 
loss trends; consumer perception of health-related issues, including obesity; consolidation in the ret ail environment; changes in purchasing and 
inventory levels of significant customers; fluctuat ions in the cost and availability of supply chain r esources, including raw materials, packaging, 
and energy; disruptions or inefficiencies in the su pply chain; effectiveness of restructuring and cost  savings initiatives; volatility in the market 
value of derivatives used to manage price risk for certain commodities; benefit plan expenses due to c hanges in plan asset values and discount 
rates used to determine plan liabilities; failure o r breach of our information technology systems; for eign economic conditions, including 
currency rate fluctuations; and political unrest in  foreign markets and economic uncertainty due to te rrorism or war.  
You should also consider the risk factors that we i dentify in Item 1A of this report, which could also  affect our future results.  
We undertake no obligation to publicly revise any f orward-looking statements to reflect events or circ umstances after the date of those 
statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipa ted or unanticipated events.  
   
We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes  in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodi ty and equity prices. Changes in 
these factors could cause fluctuations in our earni ngs and cash flows. In the normal course of busines s, we actively manage our exposure to 
these market risks by entering into various hedging  transactions, authorized under established policie s that place clear controls on these 
activities. The counterparties in these transaction s are generally highly rated institutions. We estab lish credit limits for each counterparty. Our 
hedging transactions include but are not limited to  a variety of derivative financial instruments. For  information on interest rate, foreign 
exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument ri sk, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial  Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Table of Contents  
VALUE AT RISK  
The estimates in the table below are intended to me asure the maximum potential fair value we could los e in one day from adverse changes in 
market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, comm odity prices, and equity prices under normal market  conditions. A Monte Carlo value-at- risk 
(VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market r isk for our exposures. The models assumed normal ma rket conditions and used a 95 
percent confidence level.  
The VAR calculation used historical interest and fo reign exchange rates, and commodity and equity pric es from the past year to estimate the 
potential volatility and correlation of these rates  in the future. The market data were drawn from the  RiskMetrics™ data set. The calculations 
are not intended to represent actual losses in fair  value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely 
correlates with the underlying exposure, we would e xpect that any loss or gain in the fair value of ou r derivatives would be generally offset by 
an increase or decrease in the fair value of the un derlying exposure. The positions included in the ca lculations were: debt; investments; interest 
rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity sw aps, futures and options; and equity instruments. T he calculations do not include the 
underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equi ty-related positions that are offset by these marke t-risk-sensitive instruments.  
The table below presents the estimated maximum pote ntial VAR arising from a one- day loss in fair value for our interest rate, forei gn currency, 
commodity, and equity market-risk-sensitive instrum ents outstanding as of May 31, 2015, and May 25, 20 14, and the average fair value impact 
during the year ended May 31, 2015.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
The Board of Directors and Stockholders  
General Mills, Inc.:  
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balan ce sheets of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries a s of May 31, 2015 and May 25, 2014, 
and the related consolidated statements of earnings , comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable  interest, and cash flows for each of the 
fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 31,  2015. In connection with our audits of the consoli dated financial statements, we have 
audited the accompanying financial statement schedu le. We also have audited General Mills, Inc.’s inte rnal control over financial reporting as 
of May 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Ge neral Mills, Inc.’s management is responsible for t hese consolidated financial 
statements and financial statement schedule, for ma intaining effective internal control over financial  reporting, and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial re porting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Mana gement’s Report on Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement 
schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal c ontrol over financial reporting based on our audits .  
We conducted our audits in accordance with the stan dards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Bo ard (United States). Those 
standards require that we plan and perform the audi ts to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  financial statements are free of material 
misstatement and whether effective internal control  over financial reporting was maintained in all mat erial respects. Our audits of the 
consolidated financial statements included examinin g, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts  and disclosures in the financial 
statements, assessing the accounting principles use d and significant estimates made by management, and  evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. Our audit of internal contr ol over financial reporting included obtaining an u nderstanding of internal control over 
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a mate rial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating th e design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our au dits also included performing such other procedures  as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a  reasonable basis for our opinions.  
A company’s internal control over financial reporti ng is a process designed to provide reasonable assu rance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financia l statements for external purposes in accordance wi th generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over finan cial reporting includes those policies and procedur es that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of  the assets of the Company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of financial st atements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts a nd expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the Company; and (3) pr ovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s a ssets that could have a material effect on the fina ncial statements.  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal contr ol over financial reporting may not prevent or dete ct misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are s ubject to the risk that controls may become inadequ ate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS   
Basis of Presentation  
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the a ccounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries  in which we have a controlling financial 
interest. Intercompany transactions and accounts, i ncluding any noncontrolling and redeemable interest s’ share of those transactions, are 
eliminated in consolidation.  
Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Fis cal year 2015 consisted of 53 weeks, while fiscal y ears 2014 and 2013 consisted of 52 
weeks.  
Change in Reporting Period  
As part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal y ear ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2013 we c hanged the reporting period of Europe and 
Australia within our International segment from an April fiscal year end to a May fiscal year end to m atch our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in 
the year of change, our results included 13 months of results from the affected operations compared to  12 months in following fiscal years. The 
impact of these changes was not material to our con solidated results of operations. Our Yoplait SAS, Y oplait Marques SNC, Yoki Alimentos 
S.A. (Yoki), and India businesses remain on an Apri l fiscal year end.  
Certain reclassifications to our previously reporte d financial information have been made to conform t o the current period presentation.  
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Cash and Cash Equivalents  
We consider all investments purchased with an origi nal maturity of three months or less to be cash equ ivalents.  
Inventories  
All inventories in the United States other than gra in are valued at the lower of cost, using the last- in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain 
inventories and all related cash contracts and deri vatives are valued at market with all net changes i n value recorded in earnings currently.  
Inventories outside of the United States are genera lly valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in , first-out (FIFO) method, or market.  
Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as c ost of sales, and are recognized when the 
related finished product is shipped to and accepted  by the customer.  
Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation  
Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and inter nal engineering costs, are recorded at cost 
and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primar ily using the straight-line method. Ordinary mainte nance and repairs are charged to cost of 
sales. Buildings are usually depreciated over 40 to  50 years, and equipment, furniture, and software a re usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years. 
Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or retired, the accounts are relieved of its 
cost and related accumulated depreciation and the r esulting gains and losses, if any, are recognized i n earnings. As of May 31, 2015, assets held 
for sale were insignificant.  
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whene ver events or changes in circumstances indicate tha t the carrying amount of an asset (or 
asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounte d future cash flows from the 
operation and disposition of the asset group are le ss than the carrying amount of the asset group. Ass et groups have identifiable cash flows and 
are largely independent of other asset groups. Meas urement of an impairment loss would be based on the  excess of the carrying amount of the 
asset

group over its fair value. Fair value is measured u sing a discounted cash flow model or independent ap praisals, as appropriate.  
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is test ed for impairment annually and whenever events or c hanges in circumstances indicate that 
impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is  performed for each of our reporting units. We comp are the carrying value of a reporting 
unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and lia bilities associated with the operations of that 
reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If  the carrying amount of a reporting unit 
exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and l iabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwil l, to determine if the fair value of the net 
assets is greater than the net assets including goo dwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including 
goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of  fair value are determined based on a discounted ca sh flow model. Growth rates for sales 
and profits are determined using inputs from our lo ng-range planning process. We also make estimates o f discount rates, perpetuity growth 
assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.   
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangibl e assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are f inite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a 
determination on useful life requires significant j udgments and assumptions regarding the future effec ts of obsolescence, demand, competition, 
other economic factors (such as the stability of th e industry, known technological advances, legislati ve action that results in an uncertain or 
changing regulatory environment, and expected chang es in distribution channels), the level of required  maintenance expenditures, and the 
expected lives of other related groups of assets. I ntangible assets that are deemed to have definite l ives are amortized on a straight-line basis, 
over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 t o 30 years.  
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly inta ngible assets primarily associated with the Pillsbury , Totino’s , Progresso , Green Giant , 
Yoplait , Old El Paso , Yoki , Häagen-Dazs , and Annie’s brands, are also tested for impairment annually and  whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying value ma y not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair valu e of the brands is based on a discounted 
cash flow model using inputs which included project ed revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royal ty rates that could be payable if we 
did not own the brands, and a discount rate.  
Our finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acqui red franchise agreements and customer relationships , are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that th e carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverabl e. An impairment loss would be 
recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the ass et are less than the carrying amount of 
the asset. Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would 
be based on the excess of the carrying amount of th e asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured  using a discounted cash flow model or 
other similar valuation model, as appropriate.  
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  
Our investments in companies over which we have the  ability to exercise significant influence are stat ed at cost plus our share of undistributed 
earnings or losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (pri marily research and development), and 
record the tax impact of certain joint venture oper ations that are structured as partnerships. In addi tion, we make advances to our joint ventures 
in the form of loans or capital investments. We als o sell certain raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, 
generally at market prices.  
In addition, we assess our investments in our joint  ventures if we have reason to believe an impairmen t may have occurred including, but not 
limited to, ongoing operating losses, projected dec reases in earnings, increases in the weighted avera ge cost of capital or significant business 
disruptions. The significant assumptions used to es timate fair value include revenue growth and profit ability, royalty rates, capital spending, 
depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange r ates, and a discount rate. By their nature, these p rojections and assumptions are uncertain. If 
we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the 
shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature an d write down the investment to its fair value if we  concluded the impairment is other than 
temporary.

Redeemable Interest  
We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplai t SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International  (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 percent 
interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to  put a limited portion of its redeemable interest t o us at fair value through a maximum term 
expiring December 2020. This put option requires us  to classify Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable int erest outside of equity on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longe r exercisable, the redeemable interest will 
be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of  the redeemable interest through 
additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Bala nce Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s r edemption value, which approximates its 
fair value. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 , we adjusted the redeemable interest’s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow 
model. The significant assumptions used to estimate  the redemption value include projected revenue gro wth and profitability from our long-
range plan, capital spending, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rat e.  
Revenue Recognition  
We recognize sales revenue when the shipment is acc epted by our customer. Sales include shipping and h andling charges billed to the customer 
and are reported net of consumer coupon redemption,  trade promotion and other costs, including estimat ed allowances for returns, unsalable 
product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, valu e-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. Coupons are recorded when 
distributed, based on estimated redemption rates. T rade promotions are recorded based on estimated par ticipation and performance levels for 
offered programs at the time of sale. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limit ed case-by-case basis with prior approval, 
we may allow customers to return product. In limite d circumstances, product returned in saleable condi tion is resold to other customers or 
outlets. Receivables from customers generally do no t bear interest. Terms and collection patterns vary  around the world and by channel. The 
allowance for doubtful accounts represents our esti mate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing receivables, as determined 
based on a review of past due balances and other sp ecific account data. Account balances are written o ff against the allowance when we deem 
the amount is uncollectible.  
Environmental  
Environmental costs relating to existing conditions  caused by past operations that do not contribute t o current or future revenues are expensed. 
Liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are r ecorded on an undiscounted basis when they are prob able and reasonably estimable, generally 
no later than the completion of feasibility studies  or our commitment to a plan of action.  
Advertising Production Costs  
We expense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.  
Research and Development  
All expenditures for research and development (R&D)  are charged against earnings in the year incurred.  R&D includes expenditures for new 
product and manufacturing process innovation, and t he annual expenditures are comprised primarily of i nternal salaries, wages, consulting, and 
other supplies attributable to time spent on R&D ac tivities. Other costs include depreciation and main tenance of research facilities, including 
assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plan t activities.  
Foreign Currency Translation  
For all significant foreign operations, the functio nal currency is the local currency. Assets and liab ilities of these operations are translated at the 
period-end exchange rates. Income statement account s are translated using the average exchange rates p revailing during the period. Translation 
adjustments are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency 
transactions are included in net earnings for the p eriod, except for gains and losses on investments i n subsidiaries for which settlement is not 
planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exch ange gains and losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and 
losses are recorded in AOCI.

Derivative Instruments  
All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market  prices or our estimate of their fair 
value, and are recorded in either current or noncur rent assets or liabilities based on their maturity.  Changes in the fair values of derivatives are 
recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive inc ome, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction 
and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or  losses on derivative instruments reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the period 
the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying  hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated  amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified 
to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is re cognized in earnings in the current period.  
Stock -based Compensation  
We generally measure compensation expense for grant s of restricted stock units using the value of a sh are of our stock on the date of grant. We 
estimate the value of stock option grants using a B lack-Scholes valuation model. Stock compensation is  recognized straight line over the 
vesting period. Our stock compensation expense is r ecorded in selling, general and administrative (SG& A) expenses and cost of sales in the 
Consolidated Statements of Earnings and allocated t o each reportable segment in our segment results.  
Certain equity-based compensation plans contain pro visions that accelerate vesting of awards upon reti rement, termination, or death of eligible 
employees and directors. We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s retention of  the award is no longer contingent on 
providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the rela ted compensation cost is recognized immediately for  awards granted to retirement-eligible 
individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.  
We report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as a financing cash  flow, thereby reducing net operating 
cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows.   
Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benef it, and Postemployment Benefit Plans  
We sponsor several domestic and foreign defined ben efit plans to provide pension, health care, and oth er welfare benefits to retired employees. 
Under certain circumstances, we also provide accrua ble benefits to former or inactive employees in the  United States and Canada and members 
of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recog nize an obligation for any of these 
benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Post employment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based 
solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemplo yment benefit plans are unfunded.  
We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status o f a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or lia bility and recognize changes in the 
funded status in the year in which the changes occu r through AOCI.  
Use of Estimates  
Preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally acc epted in the United States requires us 
to make estimates and assumptions that affect repor ted amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporti ng period. These estimates include our 
accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable  interest, stock-based compensation, 
income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other po stretirement benefit and postemployment benefit pla ns. Actual results could differ from our 
estimates.  
NOTE 3. ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE  
On October 21, 2014, we acquired Annie’s, Inc. (Ann ie’s), a publicly traded food company headquartered  in Berkeley, California, for an 
aggregate purchase price of $821.2 million, which w e funded by issuing debt. We consolidated Annie’s i nto our Consolidated Balance Sheets 
and recorded goodwill of $589.8 million, an indefin ite lived intangible asset for the Annie’s brand of $244.5 million, and a finite lived custome r 
relationship asset of $23.9 million. The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not material.  
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold c ertain grain elevators in our U.S. Retail segment f or $124.0 million in cash and recorded a 
pre-tax gain of $65.5 million.

NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT C OSTS  
INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT  
In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $260 million charge r elated to the impairment of our Green Giant brand intangible asset in restructuring, 
impairment, and other exit costs. See Note 6 for ad ditional information.  
RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES  
We view our restructuring activities as actions tha t help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activi ties we undertake must meet internal rate 
of return and net present value targets. Each restr ucturing action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major 
stage is completed in the case of multi-year progra ms), the project begins to deliver cash savings and /or reduced depreciation. These activities 
result in various restructuring costs, including as set write-offs, exit charges including severance, c ontract termination fees, and 
decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated deprec iation associated with restructured assets, as used  in the context of our disclosures 
regarding restructuring activity, refers to the inc rease in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value 
of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the en d of production under an approved restructuring pla n. Any impairment of the asset is 
recognized immediately in the period the plan is ap proved.  
We are currently pursuing several multi-year restru cturing initiatives designed to increase our effici ency and focus our business behind our key 
growth strategies. Charges recorded in fiscal 2015 related to these initiatives were as follows:  
   
During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we approv ed Project Catalyst, a restructuring plan to increa se organizational effectiveness and reduce 
overhead expense. In connection with this project, we expect to eliminate approximately 800 positions primarily in the United States. We 
expect to incur approximately $148 million of net e xpenses relating to these actions of which approxim ately $118 million will be cash. These 
actions were largely completed in fiscal 2015.  
Project Century (Century) is a review of our North American manufacturing and distribution network to streamline operations and identify 
potential capacity reductions. In addition to the a ctions taken at certain facilities described below,  we incurred $17.2 million of restructuring 
charges in fiscal 2015 related to Century of which $6.0 million was cash.  
As part of Century, we approved actions in the thir d quarter of fiscal 2015 to reduce our refrigerated  dough capacity and exit our Midland, 
Ontario, Canada and New Albany, Indiana facilities,  which support our U.S. Retail, International, and Convenience Stores and Foodservice 
supply chains. The Midland action will affect appro ximately 100 positions, and we expect to incur appr oximately $21 million of net expenses 
relating to this action, of which approximately $12  million will be cash. We recorded $6.5 million of restructuring charges relating to this 
action in fiscal 2015. The New Albany action will a ffect approximately 400 positions, and we expect to  incur approximately $84 million of net 
expenses relating to this action of which approxima tely $44 million will be cash. We recorded

$51.3 million of restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2015. We anticipate these act ions will be completed by the end of fiscal 
2018.  
During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we approv ed a restructuring plan to consolidate yogurt manuf acturing capacity and exit our Methuen, 
Massachusetts facility in our U.S. Retail and Conve nience Stores and Foodservice supply chains as part  of Century. This action will affect 
approximately 250 positions. We recorded $43.6 mill ion of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. We exp ect to incur approximately $69 million 
of net expenses relating to this action of which ap proximately $18 million will be cash. We expect thi s action to be completed by the end of 
fiscal 2016.  
Also as part of Century, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved a restructuring plan to  eliminate excess cereal and dry mix 
capacity and exit our Lodi, California facility in our U.S. Retail supply chain. This action will affe ct approximately 430 positions. We recorded 
$63.2 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 20 15. We expect to incur approximately $102 million o f net expenses relating to this action of 
which approximately $41 million will be cash. We ex pect this action to be completed by the end of fisc al 2016.  
During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we approve d a plan to combine certain Yoplait and General Mil ls operational facilities within our 
International segment to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. This action will affect approximately  240 positions. We recorded $13.9 million 
of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. We expect to incur approximately $15 million of net expenses relating to this action and to make 
approximately $14 million in cash payments. We expe ct this action to be completed by the end of fiscal  2016.  
In fiscal 2015, we paid $63.6 million in cash relat ed to restructuring initiatives.  
In addition to restructuring charges, we expect to incur approximately $65 million of additional proje ct-related costs, which will be recorded in 
cost of sales, all of which will be cash. We record ed $13.2 million in cost of sales for project-relat ed costs in fiscal 2015.  
Subsequent to our fiscal 2015 year end, in the firs t quarter of fiscal 2016, we approved Project Compa ss, a restructuring plan designed to enable 
our International segment to accelerate long- term growth through increased organizational effect iveness and reduced administrative expense. In 
connection with this initiative, we expect to elimi nate approximately 675 to 725 positions. We expect to record total restructuring charges of 
approximately $57 to $62 million, primarily reflect ing one-time employee termination benefits, of which approx imately $54 to $57 million will 
be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We  expect approximately $54 to $59 million of the tot al expense will result in future cash 
expenditures. These restructuring actions are expec ted to be completed by the end of fiscal 2017.

NOTE 6. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
The components of goodwill and other intangible ass ets are as follows:  
   
Based on the carrying value of finite-lived intangi ble assets as of May 31, 2015, amortization expense  for each of the next five fiscal years is 
estimated to be approximately $28 million.  
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal 2013, 2014, and 2015 are as follows:  
   
During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we reorga nized certain reporting units within our U.S. Retai l operating segment. Our chief operating 
decision maker continues to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to o ur segments at the U.S. Retail, 
International, and Convenience Stores and Foodservi ce operating segment level.  
We performed our fiscal 2015 impairment assessment as of the first day of the third quarter of fiscal 2015, and determined there was no 
impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting uni ts as their related fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values.

The changes in the carrying amount of other intangi ble assets for fiscal 2013, 2014, and 2015 are as f ollows:  
   
We performed our fiscal 2015 impairment assessment as of the first day of the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As of our assessment date, there was 
no impairment of any of our indefinite-lived intang ible assets as their related fair values were subst antially in excess of the carrying values, 
except for the  Mountain High, Uncle Toby’s, and Green Giant  brands. As of the annual assessment date, excess f air value above the carrying 
value of these brand assets was as follows:  
   
At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we  made a strategic decision to redirect certain reso urces supporting our Green Giant business in 
our U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. Therefore, future sales and profitabil ity projections in our long-range plan for 
this business declined. As a result of this trigger ing event, and in connection with the preparation o f this report, we performed an interim 
impairment assessment of the Green Giant brand intangible asset as of May 31, 2015, and dete rmined that the fair value of the brand asset no 
longer exceeded the carrying value of the asset. Si gnificant assumptions used in that assessment inclu ded our updated long- range cash flow 
projections for the Green Giant business, an update d royalty rate, a weighted- average cost of capital, and a tax rate. We recorde d a $260 million 
impairment charge in restructuring, impairment, and  other exit costs during the fourth quarter of fisc al 2015 related to this asset.  
We will continue to monitor these businesses for po tential impairment.

NOTE 7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT ACTI VITIES, AND FAIR VALUES  
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, r eceivables, accounts payable, other current liabili ties, and notes payable approximate fair 
value. Marketable securities are carried at fair va lue. As of May 31, 2015, and May 25, 2014, a compar ison of cost and market values of our 
marketable debt and equity securities is as follows :  
   
There were no realized gains or losses from sales o f available-for-sale marketable securities. Gains a nd losses are determined by specific 
identification. Classification of marketable securi ties as current or noncurrent is dependent upon our  intended holding period, the security’s 
maturity date, or both. The aggregate unrealized ga ins and losses on available-for-sale securities, ne t of tax effects, are classified in AOCI 
within stockholders’ equity.  
Scheduled maturities of our marketable securities a re as follows:  
   
As of May 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents total ing $40.1 million were pledged as collateral for de rivative contracts. As of May 31, 2015, 
$4.1 million of certain accounts receivable were pl edged as collateral against a foreign uncommitted l ine of credit.  
The fair value and carrying amounts of long-term de bt, including the current portion, were $8,996.6 mi llion and $8,608.1 million, respectively, 
as of May 31, 2015. The fair value of long-term deb t was estimated using market quotations and discoun ted cash flows based on our current 
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of in struments. Long-term debt is a Level 2 liability in  the fair value hierarchy.  
RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES  
As a part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed  to market risks such as changes in interest and fo reign currency exchange rates and 
commodity and equity prices. To manage these risks,  we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) 
pursuant to our established policies.  
COMMODITY PRICE RISK  
Many commodities we use in the production and distr ibution of our products are exposed to market price  risks. We utilize derivatives to 
manage price risk for our principal ingredients and  energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and c orn), oils (principally soybean), dairy 
products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primary  objective when entering into these derivative cont racts is to achieve certainty with regard to 
the future price of commodities

purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage ou r exposures through a combination of purchase order s, long-term contracts with suppliers, 
exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-c ounter options and swaps. We offset our exposures b ased on current and projected market 
conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs  at as close to our planned cost as possible.  
We use derivatives to manage our exposure to change s in commodity prices. We do not perform the assess ments required to achieve hedge 
accounting for commodity derivative positions. Acco rdingly, the changes in the values of these derivat ives are recorded currently in cost of 
sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we nonetheless believe that these  instruments are effective in achieving 
our objective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our suppl y chain. Accordingly, for purposes of 
measuring segment operating performance these gains  and losses are reported in unallocated corporate i tems outside of segment operating 
results until such time that the exposure we are ma naging affects earnings. At that time we reclassify  the gain or loss from unallocated 
corporate items to segment operating profit, allowi ng our operating segments to realize the economic e ffects of the derivative without 
experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatilit y, which remains in unallocated corporate items.  
Unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2015, 2014 a nd 2013 included:  
   
As of May 31, 2015, the net notional value of commo dity derivatives was $384.0 million, of which $214. 7 million related to agricultural inputs 
and $169.3 million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be u tilized within the next 12 months.  
INTEREST RATE RISK  
We are exposed to interest rate volatility with reg ard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and exi sting and future issuances of floating-rate 
debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates , LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the  United States and Europe. We use 
interest rate swaps, forward-starting interest rate  swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to  interest rate changes, to reduce the 
volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a  desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate d ebt, based on current and projected market 
conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree w ith a counterparty to exchange the difference betwe en fixed-rate and floating-rate interest 
amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.  
Floating Interest Rate Exposures — Floating-to-fixe d interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flo w hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted 
issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical deri vative method or changes in the present 
value of interest payments on the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are rec lassified into earnings over the life of the 
associated debt. Ineffective gains and losses are r ecorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffe ctiveness was less than $1 million in each 
of fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013.  
Fixed Interest Rate Exposures — Fixed-to-floating i nterest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed based 
on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt  and derivatives, using incremental borrowing rates  currently available on loans with similar 
terms and maturities. Ineffective gains and losses on these derivatives and the underlying hedged item s are recorded as net interest. The amount 
of hedge ineffectiveness was a $1.6 million gain in  fiscal 2015 and less than $1 million in fiscal 201 4 and 2013.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK  
Foreign currency fluctuations affect our net invest ments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases, 
intercompany loans, product shipments, and foreign- denominated debt. We are also exposed to the transl ation of foreign currency earnings to 
the U.S. dollar. Our principal exposures are to the  Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound s terling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, 
euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. We mainly use foreign currency forward contracts to  selectively hedge our foreign 
currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swa p our foreign-denominated commercial paper borrowin gs and nonfunctional currency 
intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the func tional currency of the entity with foreign exchange  exposure; the gains or losses on these 
derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation  gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associ ated borrowings. We generally do not 
hedge more than 18 months forward.  
As of May 31, 2015, the net notional value of forei gn exchange derivatives was $1,448.5 million. The a mount of hedge ineffectiveness was less 
than $1 million in each of fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2 013.  
We also have many net investments in foreign subsid iaries that are denominated in euros. We previously  hedged a portion of these net 
investments by issuing euro-denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. Durin g the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, 
we entered into a net investment hedge for a portio n of our net investment in foreign operations denom inated in euros by issuing € 900.0 million 
of euro-denominated bonds. During the second quarte r of fiscal 2014, we entered into a net investment hedge for a portion of our net 
investment in foreign operations denominated in eur os by issuing €500.0 million of euro-denominated bo nds. As of May 31, 2015, we had 
deferred net foreign currency transaction gains of $10.7 million in AOCI associated with hedging activ ity.  
Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy and we r emeasure the value of the assets and liabilities of  our Venezuelan subsidiary based on the 
exchange rate at which we expect to remit dividends  in U.S. dollars. In February

2014, the Venezuelan government established a new f oreign exchange market mechanism (SICAD 2) and at t hat time indicated that it would be 
the market through which U.S. dollars would be obta ined for the remittance of dividends. On February 1 2, 2015, the Venezuelan government 
replaced SICAD 2 with a new foreign exchange market  mechanism (SIMADI). We expect to be able to access  U.S. dollars through the 
SIMADI market. SIMADI has significantly higher fore ign exchange rates than those available through the  other foreign exchange mechanisms. 
In fiscal 2015, we recorded an $8.0 million foreign  exchange loss in unallocated corporate items resul ting from the remeasurement of assets 
and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary at the  SIMADI rate of 199 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Our V enezuela operations represent less than 
1 percent of our consolidated assets, liabilities, net sales, and segment operating profit. As of May 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million of non-U.S. 
dollar cash balances in Venezuela.  
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS  
Equity price movements affect our compensation expe nse as certain investments made by our employees in  our deferred compensation plan are 
revalued. We use equity swaps to manage this risk. As of May 31, 2015, the net notional amount of our equity swaps was $124.2 million. 
These swap contracts mature in fiscal 2016.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES  
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provi sions that require us to maintain an investment gra de credit rating on our debt from each of 
the major credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request 
full collateralization on derivative instruments in  net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-
related contingent features that were in a liabilit y position on May 31, 2015, was $81.5 million. We h ave posted $25.0 million of collateral 
under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related c ontingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on May 31, 2015, we would 
have been required to post $56.5 million of collate ral to counterparties.  
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RI SK  
During fiscal 2015, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its a ffiliates (Wal-Mart) accounted for 21 percent of ou r consolidated net sales and 30 percent of 
our net sales in the U.S. Retail segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our co nsolidated net sales. Wal-Mart also 
represented 7 percent of our net sales in the Inter national segment and 9 percent of our net sales in the Convenience Stores and Foodservice 
segment. As of May 31, 2015, Wal- Mart accounted for 29 percent of our U.S. Retail re ceivables, 6 percent of our International receivabl es, and 
9 percent of our Convenience Stores and Foodservice  receivables. The five largest customers in our U.S . Retail segment accounted for 54 
percent of its fiscal 2015 net sales, the five larg est customers in our International segment accounte d for 24 percent of its fiscal 2015 net sales, 
and the five largest customers in our Convenience S tores and Foodservice segment accounted for 44 perc ent of its fiscal 2015 net sales.  
We enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily  with a diversified group of highly rated 
counterparties. We continually monitor our position s and the credit ratings of the counterparties invo lved and, by policy, limit the amount of 
credit exposure to any one party. These transaction s may expose us to potential losses due to the risk  of nonperformance by these 
counterparties; however, we have not incurred a mat erial loss. We also enter into commodity futures tr ansactions through various regulated 
exchanges.  
The amount of loss due to the credit risk of the co unterparties, should the counterparties fail to per form according to the terms of the contracts, 
is $16.7 million against which we do not hold colla teral. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some  of our transactions require collateral or 
other security to support financial instruments sub ject to threshold levels of exposure and counterpar ty credit risk. Collateral assets are either 
cash or U.S. Treasury instruments and are held in a  trust account that we may access if the counterpar ty defaults.  
We offer certain suppliers access to a third party service that allows them to view our scheduled paym ents online. The third party service also 
allows suppliers to finance advances on our schedul ed payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. We have no economic 
interest in these financing arrangements and no dir ect relationship with the suppliers, the third part y, or any financial institutions concerning 
this service. All of our accounts payable remain as  obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supp lier agreements. As of May 31, 2015, 
$448.6 million of our total accounts payable is pay able to suppliers who utilize this third party serv ice.

We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplai t SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal 
holds the remaining interests in each of the entiti es. On the acquisition date, we recorded the $904.4  million fair value of Sodiaal’s 49 percent 
euro-denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as a redee mable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put a limited 
portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair va lue once per year through a maximum term expiring D ecember 2020. We adjust the value of 
the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterl y to the redeemable interest’ s redemption 
value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait S AS pays dividends annually if it meets certain fina ncial metrics set forth in its shareholders 
agreement. As of May 31, 2015, the redemption value  of the euro-denominated redeemable interest was $7 78.9 million.  
In addition, a subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entere d into an exclusive milk supply agreement for its E uropean operations with Sodiaal at 
market-determined prices through July 1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $271.3 million for fiscal 2015 an d $311.2 million for fiscal 2014.  
On the acquisition dates, we recorded the $281.4 mi llion fair value of Sodiaal’s 50 percent euro-denom inated interest in Yoplait Marques SNC 
and 50 percent Canadian dollar-denominated interest  in Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interest s on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Yoplait Marques SNC earns a royalty stream through a licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS for the righ ts to  Yoplait  and related trademarks. 
Liberté Marques Sàrl earns a royalty stream through  licensing agreements with certain Yoplait group co mpanies for the rights to  Liberté  and 
related trademarks. These entities pay dividends an nually based on their available cash as of their fi scal year end.  
During fiscal 2015, we paid $17.7 million of divide nds to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS a nd Yoplait Marques SNC shareholder 
agreements.  
The holder of the GMC Class A Interests receives qu arterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a 
floating preferred return rate, to the holder’s cap ital account balance established in the most recent  mark-to-market valuation (currently $251.5 
million). In fiscal 2015, the floating preferred re turn rate was equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR  plus 110 basis points. The preferred 
return rate is adjusted every three years through a  negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest hol der or through a remarketing auction. On 
June 1, 2015, subsequent to our year-end, the float ing preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A interest s was reset to the sum of three-month 
LIBOR plus 125 basis points.  
For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabi lities, results of operations, and cash flows of ou r non-wholly owned subsidiaries are included 
in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The third -party investor’s share of the net earnings of thes e subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings 
attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling inter ests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  
Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive co venants. As of May 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.  
NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  
Cumulative preference stock of 5.0 million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued.  
On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized t he repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our co mmon stock. Purchases under the 
authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the us e of call options and other derivative 
instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and acceler ated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date.  
During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 22.3 million sha res of common stock for an aggregate purchase price  of $1,161.9 million. During fiscal 
2014, we repurchased 35.6 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,774.4 m illion. During fiscal 2013, we 
repurchased 24.2 million shares of common stock for  an aggregate purchase price of $1,014.9 million.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we entere d into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) agreem ent with an unrelated third party 
financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of  $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Un der the ASR agreement, we paid $300.0 
million to the financial institution and received 5 .5 million shares of common stock with a fair value  of $270.0 million during the fourth quarter 
of 2013. We received an additional 0.6 million shar es of common stock upon completion of the ASR agree ment during the first quarter of fiscal 
2014. As of May 26, 2013, we recorded this transact ion as an increase in treasury stock of $270.0 mill ion, and recorded the remaining $30.0 
million as a decrease to additional paid-in capital  on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completio n of the ASR agreement in the first 
quarter of fiscal 2014, we reclassified the $30.0 m illion to treasury stock from additional paid-in ca pital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTE 11. STOCK PLANS  
We use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of ou r stockholders. As of May 31, 2015, a 
total of 27.1 million shares were available for gra nt in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and shares of 
unrestricted stock under the 2011 Stock Compensatio n Plan (2011 Plan) and the 2011 Compensation Plan f or Non-Employee Directors. The 
2011 Plan also provides for the issuance of cash-se ttled share-based units, stock appreciation rights,  and performance based stock awards. 
Stock-based awards now outstanding include some gra nted under the 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009 sto ck plans, under which no further 
awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement, term ination, or death of eligible employees 
and directors.  
Stock Options  
The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes opti on-pricing model were as follows:  
   
The valuation of stock options is a significant acc ounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a 
material impact on our financial statements. We est imate the fair value of each option on the grant da te using a Black-Scholes option-pricing 
model, which requires us to make predictive assumpt ions regarding future stock price volatility, emplo yee exercise behavior, dividend yield, 
and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future sto ck price volatility using the historical volatility  over the expected term of the option, 
excluding time periods of volatility we believe a m arketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have 
considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options o n our stock, especially those with tenors of 
greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a  reliable measure of expected volatility.

Our expected term represents the period of time tha t options granted are expected to be outstanding ba sed on historical data to estimate option 
exercises and employee terminations within the valu ation model. Separate groups of employees have simi lar historical exercise behavior and 
therefore were aggregated into a single pool for va luation purposes. The weighted-average expected ter m for all employee groups is presented 
in the table above. The risk-free interest rate for  periods during the expected term of the options is  based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon 
yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  
Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exer cise or vesting of an award in excess of that previ ously recognized in earnings (referred to 
as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Cons olidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing ca sh flow.  
Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to addi tional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Bala nce Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits 
(amounts which are less than that previously recogn ized in earnings) are first offset against the cumu lative balance of windfall tax benefits, if 
any, and then charged directly to income tax expens e, potentially resulting in volatility in our conso lidated effective income tax rate. We 
calculated a cumulative memo balance of windfall ta x benefits for the purpose of accounting for future  shortfall tax benefits.  
Options may be priced at 100 percent or more of the  fair market value on the date of grant, and genera lly vest four years after the date of grant. 
Options generally expire within 10 years and one mo nth after the date of grant.  
Information on stock option activity follows:  
   
Stock-based compensation expense related to stock o ption awards was $18.1 million in fiscal 2015, $18. 2 million in fiscal 2014, and $17.5 
million in fiscal 2013. Compensation expense relate d to stock-based payments recognized in the Consoli dated Statements of Earnings includes 
amounts recognized in restructuring, impairment, an d other exit costs for fiscal 2015.

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Perfo rmance Share Units  
Stock and units settled in stock subject to a restr icted period and a purchase price, if any (as deter mined by the Compensation Committee of the 
Board of Directors), may be granted to key employee s under the 2011 Plan. Restricted stock and restric ted stock units generally vest and 
become unrestricted four years after the date of gr ant. Performance share units are earned based on ou r future achievement of three-year goals 
for average organic net sales growth and cumulative  free cash flow. Performance share units are subjec t to a four year vesting period and will 
be settled with common stock one year following the  completion of the three-year performance period. T he sale or transfer of these awards is 
restricted during the vesting period. Participants holding restricted stock, but not restricted stock units or performance share units, are entitled 
to vote on matters submitted to holders of common s tock for a vote. These awards accumulate dividends from the date of grant, but participants 
only receive payment if the awards vest.  
Information on restricted stock unit, performance s hare units, and cash-settled share-based units acti vity follows:  
   
   
The total grant-date fair value of restricted stock  unit awards that vested during fiscal 2015 was $13 3.7 million, and $104.6 million vested 
during fiscal 2014.  
As of May 31, 2015, unrecognized compensation expen se related to non-vested stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share 
units was $101.9 million. This expense will be reco gnized over 17 months, on average.  
Stock-based compensation expense related to restric ted stock units, performance share units, and cash- settled share-based payment awards was 
$96.6 million for fiscal 2015, $107.0 million for f iscal 2014, and $128.9 million for fiscal 2013. Com pensation expense related to stock-based

NOTE 13. RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BEN EFITS  
Defined Benefit Pension Plans  
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many  employees in the United States, Canada, France, an d the United Kingdom. Benefits for 
salaried employees are based on length of service a nd final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly 
amounts for each year of credited service. Our fund ing policy is consistent with the requirements of a pplicable laws. We made no voluntary 
contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal  2015 and 2014, and made a $200.0 million voluntary  contribution in fiscal 2013. We do not 
expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2016. Our principal domestic retirement plan  covering salaried employees has a 
provision that any excess pension assets would be a llocated to active participants if the plan is term inated within five years of a change in 
control. In fiscal 2012, we announced changes to ou r U.S. defined benefit pension plans. All new salar ied employees hired on or after June 1, 
2013 are eligible for a new retirement program that  does not include a defined benefit pension plan. C urrent salaried employees remain in the 
existing defined benefit pension plan with adjustme nts to benefits.  
Other Postretirement Benefit Plans  
We also sponsor plans that provide health care bene fits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United States 
salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of servic e. We make decisions to fund related trusts 
for certain employees and retirees on an annual bas is. We made $24.0 million in voluntary contribution s to these plans in fiscal 2015 and 
$24.0 million in voluntary contributions to these p lans in fiscal 2014.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates  
Assumed health care cost trends are as follows:  
   
We review our health care cost trend rates annually . Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and 
information provided by our actuaries. This informa tion includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and 
projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend r ate is adjusted as necessary to remain 
consistent with this review, recent experiences, an d short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.3 percent for 
retirees age 65 and over and 6.5 percent for retire es under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2015. Rates ar e graded down annually until the ultimate 
trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2025 for al l retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calc ulations only if the retirees’ benefits increase 
as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to a pproximate the current economic view on the 
rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate hea lth care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for heal th care costs have an important effect on 
the amounts reported for the other postretirement b enefit plans.  
A one percentage point change in the health care co st trend rate would have the following effects:  
   
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconcilia tion Act of 2010 (collectively, the 
Act) was signed into law in March 2010. The Act cod ifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. Estimates of 
the future impacts of several of the Act’s provisio ns are incorporated into our postretirement benefit  liability.  
Postemployment Benefit Plans  
Under certain circumstances, we also provide accrua ble benefits to former or inactive employees in the  United States, Canada, and Mexico, and 
members of our Board of Directors, including severa nce and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of 
these benefits that vest or accumulate with service . Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accum ulate with service (such as severance 
based solely on annual pay rather than years of ser vice) are charged to expense when incurred. Our pos temployment benefit plans are 
unfunded.  
We use our fiscal year end as the measurement date for our defined benefit pension and other postretir ement benefit plans.

Assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payment s a participant will receive over their 
lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. On  October 27, 2014, the Society of Actuaries publish ed RP-2014 Mortality Tables and 
Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2014, which both ref lect improved longevity. We adopted the change to t he mortality assumptions to 
remeasure our defined benefit pension plans and oth er postretirement benefit plans obligations, which increased the total of these obligations by 
$436.7 million.  
The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $5,750.4 million as of Ma y 31, 2015, and $5,093.1 million as of 
May 25, 2014.

Discount Rates  
Our discount rate assumptions are determined annual ly as of the last day of our fiscal year for our de fined benefit pension, other postretirement 
benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligation s. We also use the same discount rates to determine  defined benefit pension, other 
postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal ye ar. We work with our outside actuaries 
to determine the timing and amount of expected futu re cash outflows to plan participants and, using th e Aa Above Median corporate bond 
yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, in cluding a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is 
applied to our expected future cash outflows to det ermine our discount rate assumptions.

allocations. Investments include: fixed income secu rities and bond futures generally valued at closing  prices from national exchanges, 
fixed income pricing models, and independent financ ial analysts; and fixed income commingled funds val ued at unit values provided by 
the investment managers, which are based on the fai r value of the underlying investments. 
(c) Publicly traded common stock and limited partne rships in the energy and real estate sectors for pu rposes of total return. Investments 
include: energy and real estate securities generall y valued at closing prices from national exchanges;  and commingled funds, private 
securities, and limited partnerships valued at unit  values or net asset values provided by the investm ent managers, which are generally 
based on the fair value of the underlying investmen ts. 
(d) Global balanced fund of equity, fixed income, a nd real estate securities for purposes of meeting C anadian pension plan asset allocation 
policies, and insurance and annuity contracts to pr ovide a stable stream of income for retirees and to  fund postretirement medical benefits. 
Fair values are derived from unit values provided b y the investment managers, which are generally base d on the fair value of the 
underlying investments and contract fair values fro m the providers.

The following table is a roll forward of the Level 3 investments of our pension and postretirement ben efit plans’ assets during the years ended 
May 31, 2015 and May 25, 2014:  
   
   
The net change in level 3 assets attributable to un realized losses at May 31, 2015, was $113.4 million  for our pension plan assets, and $1.5 
million for our postretirement benefit plan assets.   
Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets  
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is deter mined by our asset allocation, our historical long- term investment performance, our estimate 
of future long-term returns by asset class (using i nput from our actuaries, investment services, and i nvestment managers), and long-term 
inflation assumptions. We review this assumption an nually for each plan, however, our annual investmen t performance for one particular year 
does not, by itself, significantly influence our ev aluation.

Weighted-average asset allocations for the past two  fiscal years for our defined benefit pension and o ther postretirement benefit plans are as 
follows:  
   
The investment objective for our defined benefit pe nsion and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to 
participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal i s to optimize the long-term return on plan assets a t a moderate level of risk. The defined 
benefit pension plan and other postretirement benef it plan portfolios are broadly diversified across a sset classes. Within asset classes, the 
portfolios are further diversified across investmen t styles and investment organizations. For the defi ned benefit pension plans, the long-term 
investment policy allocation is: 25 percent to equi ties in the United States; 15 percent to internatio nal equities; 10 percent to private equities; 35 
percent to fixed income; and 15 percent to real ass ets (real estate, energy, and timber). For other po stretirement benefit plans, the long-term 
investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to eq uities in the United States; 20 percent to internat ional equities; 10 percent to private equities; 
30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actua l allocations to these asset classes may vary 
tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.  
Contributions and Future Benefit Payments  
We do not expect to be required to make contributio ns to our defined benefit pension, other postretire ment benefit, and postemployment benefit 
plans in fiscal 2016. Actual fiscal 2016 contributi ons could exceed our current projections, as influe nced by our decision to undertake 
discretionary funding of our benefit trusts and fut ure changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated b enefit payments, which reflect expected 
future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid from fiscal 2016 to 2025 as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans  
The General Mills Savings Plan is a defined contrib ution plan that covers domestic salaried, hourly, n onunion, and certain union employees. 
This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment funds, including a Company sto ck fund and an Employee Stock 
Ownership Plan (ESOP). We sponsor another money pur chase plan for certain domestic hourly employees wi th net assets of $21.9 million as 
of May 31, 2015, and $20.6 million as of May 25, 20 14. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in m any of our foreign locations. Our total 
recognized expense related to defined contribution plans was $44.0 million in fiscal 2015, $44.8 milli on in fiscal 2014, and $46.0 million in 
fiscal 2013.  
We match a percentage of employee contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan. The Company match i s directed to investment options of 
the participant’s choosing. The number of shares of  our common stock allocated to participants in the ESOP was 7.5 million as of May 31, 
2015, and 8.4 million as of May 25, 2014. The ESOP’ s only assets are our common stock and temporary ca sh balances.

Of the total valuation allowance of $215.4 million,  the majority relates to a deferred tax asset for l osses recorded as part of the Pillsbury 
acquisition in the amount of $160.9 million and $47 .8 million relates to various state and foreign los s carryforwards. As of May 31, 2015, we 
believe it is more-likely-than-not that the remaind er of our deferred tax assets are realizable.  
We have $89.9 million of operating loss carryforwar ds. Of this amount, $78.7 million is foreign loss c arryforwards and the carryforward 
periods are as follows: $50.2 million do not expire ; $3.8 million expire in fiscal 2016 and 2017; and $24.7 million expire in fiscal 2018 and 
beyond. The remaining $11.2 million are state opera ting loss carryforwards, the majority of which expi re after 2023.  
We have not recognized a deferred tax liability for  unremitted earnings of approximately $1.9 billion from our foreign operations because our 
subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undis tributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings wil l be remitted in a tax- neutral transaction. It is 
not practicable for us to determine the amount of u nrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these indef initely reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes 
are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations  when we determine that such earnings are no longer  indefinitely reinvested. In fiscal 2015, 
we approved a one-time repatriation of $606.1 milli on of foreign earnings to reduce the economic cost of funding current restructuring 
initiatives and the acquisition of Annie’s complete d in fiscal 2015. We recorded a discrete tax charge  of $78.6 million in fiscal 2015 related to 
this action. We have previously asserted that our f oreign earnings are permanently reinvested and will  only be repatriated in a tax-neutral 
manner, and this one-time repatriation does not cha nge this on-going assertion.  
In fiscal 2010, we recorded a non-cash income tax c harge and decrease to our deferred tax assets of $3 5.0 million related to a reduction of the 
tax deductibility of retiree health cost to the ext ent of any Medicare Part D subsidy received beginni ng in fiscal 2013 under the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by t he Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. During fiscal 2013, we took 
certain actions to restore part of the tax benefits  associated with Medicare Part D subsidies and reco rded a $33.7 million discrete decrease to 
income tax expense and an increase to our deferred tax assets.  
During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, in conjunc tion with the consent of the Class A investor, we r estructured our GMC subsidiary through the 
distribution of its manufacturing assets, stock, in ventory, cash, and certain intellectual property to  a wholly owned subsidiary. GMC retained 
the remaining intellectual property. Immediately fo llowing this restructuring, the Class A Interests w ere sold by the then current holder to 
another unrelated third party investor. As a result  of these transactions, we recorded a $63.3 million  decrease to deferred income tax liabilities 
related to the tax basis of the investment in GMC a nd certain distributed assets, with a corresponding  discrete non-cash reduction to income 
taxes in fiscal 2013.  
We are subject to federal income taxes in the Unite d States as well as various state, local, and forei gn jurisdictions. A number of years may 
elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult t o predict the final outcome or the timing of 
resolution of any particular uncertain tax position , we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust 
these liabilities, as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances. Sett lement of any particular position would usually 
require the use of cash.  
The number of years with open tax audits varies dep ending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing ju risdictions include the United States 
(federal and state) and Canada. Various tax examina tions by United States state taxing authorities cou ld be conducted for any open tax year, 
which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years.  
Several state and foreign examinations are currentl y in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on our 
results of operations or financial position.  
During fiscal 2014, the Internal Revenue Service co ncluded its field examination of our 2011 and 2012 tax years. The audit closure and related 
adjustments did not have a material impact on our r esults of operations or financial position. As of M ay 31, 2015, we have effectively settled 
all issues with the Internal Revenue Service for fi scal years 2012 and prior.

We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the re cognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positi ons. Accordingly, we recognize the 
amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 pe rcent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment 
related to the expected ultimate resolution of unce rtain tax positions will affect earnings in the qua rter of such change.  
The following table sets forth changes in our total  gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, exclud ing accrued interest, for fiscal 2015 and 
2014. Approximately $84 million of this total in fi scal 2015 represents the amount that, if recognized , would affect our effective income tax 
rate in future periods. This amount differs from th e gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because certain of the liabilities 
below would impact deferred taxes if recognized. We  also would record a decrease in U.S. federal incom e taxes upon recognition of the state 
tax benefits included therein.  
   
As of May 31, 2015, we expect to pay approximately $1.4 million of unrecognized tax benefit liabilitie s and accrued interest within the next 12 
months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to  uncertainties in the timing of tax audit 
outcomes. The remaining amount of our unrecognized tax liability was classified in other liabilities.  
We report accrued interest and penalties related to  unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax  expense. For fiscal 2015, we recognized a 
net benefit of $0.2 million of tax-related net inte rest and penalties, and had $35.2 million of accrue d interest and penalties as of May 31, 2015. 
For fiscal 2014, we recognized a net benefit of $4. 6 million of tax-related net interest and penalties , and had $42.0 million of accrued interest 
and penalties as of May 25, 2014.  
NOTE 15. LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND CONTINGENCI ES  
The Company’s leases are generally for warehouse sp ace and equipment. Rent expense under all operating  leases from continuing operations 
was $193.5 million, $189.0 million, and $187.9 mill ion in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  
Some operating leases require payment of property t axes, insurance, and maintenance costs in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and 
escalation rent in excess of minimum rent payments and sublease income netted in rent expense were ins ignificant.

These future lease commitments will be partially of fset by estimated future sublease receipts of appro ximately $4 million. Depreciation on 
capital leases is recorded as depreciation expense in our results of operations.  
As of May 31, 2015, we have issued guarantees and c omfort letters of $434.4 million for the debt and o ther obligations of consolidated 
subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of  $258.5 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly 
CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements ar e generally limited to the future payments under no n-cancelable operating leases, which 
totaled $400.5 million as of May 31, 2015.  
NOTE 16. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATIO N  
We operate in the consumer foods industry. We have three operating segments by type of customer and ge ographic region as follows: U.S. 
Retail, 59.6 percent of our fiscal 2015 consolidate d net sales; International, 29.1 percent of our fis cal 2015 consolidated net sales; and 
Convenience Stores and Foodservice, 11.3 percent of  our fiscal 2015 consolidated net sales.  
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we h ave changed how we assess operating segment perform ance to exclude the asset and liability 
remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economi es. This impact is now included in unallocated corp orate items. All periods presented 
have been changed to conform to this presentation.  
Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2015, w e realigned certain operating units within our U.S.  Retail operating segment. We also 
changed the name of our Yoplait operating unit to Y ogurt and our Big G operating unit to Cereal. Froze n Foods transitioned into Meals and 
Baking Products. Small Planet Foods transitioned in to Snacks, Cereal, and Meals. The Yogurt operating unit was unchanged. We revised the 
amounts previously reported in the net sales and ne t sales percentage change by operating unit within our U.S. Retail segment to conform to the 
new operating unit structure. These realignments ha d no effect on previously reported consolidated net  sales, operating segments’ net sales, 
operating profit, segment operating profit, net ear nings attributable to General Mills, or EPS. In add ition, results from the acquired Annie’s 
business are included in the Meals and Snacks opera ting units. Our chief operating decision maker cont inues to assess performance and make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to our se gments at the U.S. Retail, International, and Conve nience Stores and Foodservice operating 
segment level.  
Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wi de variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, m embership stores, natural food chains, 
and drug, dollar and discount chains operating thro ughout the United States. Our product categories in  this business segment are ready-to-eat 
cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, shel f stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and fr ozen dough products, dessert and baking 
mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic pr oducts including meal kits, granola bars, 
and cereal.

Table of Contents  
Our International segment consists of retail and fo odservice businesses outside of the United States. Our product categories include ready-to-
eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, me al kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, de ssert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, 
refrigerated yogurt, grain and fruit snacks, and su per-premium ice cream and frozen desserts. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen 
desserts directly to consumers through owned retail  shops. Our International segment also includes pro ducts manufactured in the United States 
for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sal e to our international joint ventures. 
Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end  customer is located.  
In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment o ur major product categories are ready-to-eat cereal s, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen 
breakfasts, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough pr oducts, baking mixes, and flour. Many products we s ell are branded to the consumer and 
nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to  distributors and operators in many customer channe ls including foodservice, convenience 
stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries. Substant ially all of this segment’s operations are located in the United States.  
Operating profit for these segments excludes unallo cated corporate items and restructuring, impairment , and other exit costs. Unallocated 
corporate items include corporate overhead expenses , variances to planned domestic employee benefits a nd incentives, contributions to the 
General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remea surement impact of hyperinflationary economies, res tructuring initiative project-related 
costs, and other items that are not part of our mea surement of segment operating performance. These in clude gains and losses arising from the 
revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from mark-to- market valuation of certain commodity positions unt il passed back to 
our operating segments. These items affecting opera ting profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure 
of segment profitability reviewed by executive mana gement. Under our supply chain organization, our ma nufacturing, warehouse, and 
distribution activities are substantially integrate d across our operations in order to maximize effici ency and productivity. As a result, fixed 
assets and depreciation and amortization expenses a re neither maintained nor available by operating se gment.

AOCI . Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  
Average total capital. Notes payable, long-term debt including current por tion, redeemable interest, noncontrolling interests , and stockholders’

Constant currency. Financial results translated to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates based on t he rates in effect for

dollars are translated into United States dollars a t the average exchange rates in effect during the c orresponding period of the prior fiscal year, 
rather than the actual average exchange rates in ef fect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the  foreign currency impact is equal to current 
year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rat e between the current fiscal period and the

requires significant management judgment. The three  levels are defined as follows:  
   
   
   
Fixed charge coverage ratio. The sum of earnings before income taxes and fixed c harges (before tax), divided by the sum of the fixe d charges 
(before tax) and interest.  
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Guidelines, procedures, and practices that we are r equired to use in recording and 
reporting accounting information in our financial s tatements.  
Goodwill. The difference between the purchase price of acquir ed companies plus the fair value of any noncontroll ing and redeemable interests 
and the related fair values of net assets acquired.   
Gross margin. Net sales less cost of sales.  
Hedge accounting. Accounting for qualifying hedges that allows change s in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset co rresponding changes 
in the hedged item in the same reporting period. He dge accounting is permitted for  
   
103    Level  1:       Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for iden tical assets or liabilities. 
  Level  2:       Observable inputs other than quoted prices included  in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar asse ts or liabilities in active 
markets or quoted prices for identical assets or li abilities in inactive markets. 
  Level  3:       Unobservable inputs reflecting management ’s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsibl e for establishing and maintaining adequate interna l control over financial reporting, as 
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 19 34 Act. The Company’s internal control system was d esigned to provide reasonable 
assurance to our management and the Board of Direct ors regarding the preparation and fair presentation  of published financial statements. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of  management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we 
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our  internal control over financial reporting as of Ma y 31, 2015. In making this assessment, 
management used the criteria set forth by the Commi ttee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Co mmission (COSO) in Internal 
Control – Integrated Framework (2013) .  
Based on our assessment using the criteria set fort h by COSO in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) , management concluded that 
our internal control over financial reporting was e ffective as of May 31, 2015.

Exhibit 10.6 
GENERAL MILLS, INC.  
2011 STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN  
   
The purpose of the General Mills, Inc. 2011 Stock C ompensation Plan (the “Plan”) is to attract and ret ain able individuals by rewarding 
employees of General Mills, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates (defined as entities in which Genera l Mills, Inc. has a significant equity or 
other interest, collectively, the “Company”) and to  align the interests of employees with those of the  stockholders of the Company. The 
Company shall include any successors to General Mil ls, Inc. or any future parent corporations or simil ar entities.  
   
This Plan shall become effective as of September 26 , 2011, subject to the approval of the stockholders  of the Company at the Annual 
Meeting on that date. Awards may be made under the Plan until September 30, 2021.  
   
Only persons who are employees of the Company shall  be eligible to receive grants of Stock Options, St ock Appreciation Rights, 
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and/or Pe rformance Awards (each defined below) and become “P articipants” under the Plan. 
The Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board o f Directors (the “Committee”) shall exercise the di scretionary authority to 
determine from time to time the employees of the Co mpany who are eligible to participate in this Plan.  Individuals who are not classified 
by the Company as employees on its corporate books,  records and systems are not eligible to receive Aw ards even if any individual is 
later reclassified (by the Company, any court, any government agency or otherwise) as an employee of t he Company as of any date in 
particular.  
   
   
   1. PURPOSE OF THE PLAN 
2. EFFECTIVE DATE AND DURATION OF PLAN 
3. ELIGIBLE PERSONS 
4. AWARD TYPES 
  (a) Stock Option Awards.  The Committee may award Participants options (“Sto ck Options”) to purchase a fixed number of shares o f 
common stock ($.10 par value) of the Company (“Comm on Stock”). The grant of a Stock Option entitles the Participan t to purchase 
shares of Common Stock at an “Exercise Price” established by the Committee which, unless the Stoc k Option is granted through the 
assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted to individuals who become  employees of the Company 
as a result of a merger, consolidation, acquisition  or other transaction involving the Company (in whi ch case the assumption or 
substitution shall be accomplished in a manner that  permits the Award to be exempt from Code Section 4 09A), shall not be less 
than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common St ock on the date of grant, and may exceed the Fair M arket Value on the grant 
date, at the Committee’s discretion. “Fair Market V alue” shall equal the closing price on the New York  Stock Exchange of the 
Company ’s Common Stock on the applicable date. 
  (b) Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee may also award Participants Stock Ap preciation Rights. A Stock Appreciation Right is 
a right to receive, upon exercise of that right, an  amount, which may be paid in cash, shares of Commo n Stock, or a combination 
thereof in the complete discretion of the Committee , equal to or less than the difference between the Fair Market Value of one share 
of Common Stock as of the date of exercise and the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on t he date of grant, unless 
the Stock Appreciation Right was granted through th e assumption of, or in substitution for, outstandin g awards previously granted 
to individuals who become employees of the Company as a result of a merger, consolidation, acquisition , or other transaction 
involving the Company (in which case the assumption  or substitution shall be accomplished in a manner that permits the Award to 
be exempt from Code Section 409A). 
   
Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricte d Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awa rds are sometimes referred to 
as “Awards”. To the extent any Award is subject to section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 409A”), 
the terms and administration of such Award shall co mply therewith and IRS guidance thereunder. If any provision of the Plan would 
otherwise conflict with or frustrate this intent, t hat provision will be interpreted and deemed amende d so as to avoid the conflict. Further, 
for purposes of the limitations on nonqualified def erred compensation under Section 409A, each payment  of compensation under this 
Plan shall be treated as a separate payment of comp ensation for purposes of applying the Section 409A deferral election rules and the 
exclusion from Section 409A for certain short-term deferral amounts.  
   
   
In addition, any Common Stock covered by a Stock Op tion or Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan which is forfeited 
prior to the end of the vesting period, or which ex pires or otherwise terminates without being exercis ed, shall be deemed not to be 
granted for purposes of determining the maximum num ber of shares of Common Stock available for Awards under the Plan. In the 
event a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right is  settled for cash, the number of shares deducted ag ainst the maximum number 
of shares provided in Section 5(a) shall be restore d and again be available for Awards. However, if (i ) any Stock Option is exercised 
through the delivery of Common Stock in satisfactio n of the Exercise Price, and (ii) withholding tax r equirements arising upon 
exercise of any Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right are satisfied through the withholding of Comm on Stock otherwise 
deliverable in connection with such exercise, the f ull number of shares of Common Stock underlying any  such Stock Option or 
Stock Appreciation Right, or portion thereof being so issued shall count against the maximum number of  shares available for grants 
under the Plan.  
Upon forfeiture or termination of Stock Options, St ock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Restrict ed Stock Units and 
Performance Awards prior to vesting, the shares of Common Stock subject thereto shall again be availab le for Awards under the 
Plan added back in the same multiple as they were a warded pursuant to the first paragraph of this Sect ion 5(a).  
     (c) Restricted Stock Awards.  The Committee may grant Participants, subject to c ertain restrictions, shares of Common Stock 
(“Restricted Stock ”) or the right to receive shares of Common Stock or c ash ( “Restricted Stock Units ”). 
  (d) Performance Awards.  Performance Awards may be made by the Committee gr anting a right to either the value of a number of 
shares of Common Stock (“Performance Share Units”) or a monetary amount, which could be settled in suc h shares or in cash or a 
combination thereof ( “Performance Units ”), determined based on the extent to which applicable performance goals are achieved. 
5. COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN 
  (a) Maximum Shares Available for Delivery.  Subject to Section 5(c), the maximum number of sha res of Common Stock available for 
Awards to Participants under the Plan shall be 40,0 00,000. Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights  awarded shall reduce the 
number of shares available for Awards by one share for every one share granted; provided that Stock Ap preciation Rights that may 
be settled only in cash shall not reduce the number  of shares available for Awards. Awards of Restrict ed Stock, Restricted Stock 
Units and Performance Awards settled in shares of C ommon Stock shall reduce the number of shares avail able for Awards by one 
share for every one share delivered, up to 30 perce nt of the total number of shares available; beyond that, Restricted Stock, 
Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards settl ed in shares of Common Stock shall reduce the numbe r of shares available for 
Awards by six shares for every one share delivered.  Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards that  may be settled only in 
cash shall not reduce the number of shares availabl e for Awards. 
  (b) Individual Limits.  The number of shares of Common Stock subject to St ock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights or shares  of 
Common Stock available for Restricted Stock, Restri cted Stock Units and Performance Awards granted und er the Plan to any single 
Participant shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 2,0 00,000 shares and/or units per fiscal year. The max imum dollar value of 
Performance Awards payable to any single Participan t shall be $20,000,000 per fiscal year. These per-P articipant limits shall be 
construed and applied consistently with Code sectio n 162(m) and the regulations thereunder. 
   
   
   
   
   
     (c) Adjustments for Corporate Transactions.  If a corporate transaction has occurred affecting the Common Stock such that an 
adjustment to outstanding Awards is required to pre serve (or prevent enlargement of) the benefits or p otential benefits intended at 
the time of grant, then in such manner as the Commi ttee deems equitable, an appropriate adjustment sha ll be made to (i) the number 
and kind of shares which may be awarded under the P lan; (ii) the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Awards; (iii) the 
number of shares credited to an account; (iv) the i ndividual limits imposed under the Plan; and if app licable; (v) the Exercise Price 
of outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Right s provided that the number of shares of Common Stoc k subject to any Stock 
Option or Stock Appreciation Right denominated in C ommon Stock shall always be a whole number. Any sha res of Common Stock 
underlying Awards granted through the assumption of , or in substitution for, outstanding awards previo usly granted to individuals 
who become employees of the Company as a result of a corporate transaction involving the Company shall  not, unless required by 
law or regulation, count against the reserve of ava ilable shares of Common Stock under the Plan. For p urposes of this paragraph a 
corporate transaction includes, but is not limited to, any dividend (other than a cash dividend that i s not an extraordinary cash 
dividend) or other distribution (whether in the for m of cash, Common Stock, securities of a subsidiary  of the Company, other 
securities or other property), recapitalization, st ock split, reverse stock split, combination of shar es, reorganization, merger, 
consolidation, acquisition, split-up, spin-off, com bination, repurchase or exchange of Common Stock or  other securities of the 
Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to pu rchase Common Stock or other securities of the Comp any, or other similar 
corporate transaction. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, an adjustment to a Stock Option or Stock 
Appreciation Right under this paragraph shall be ma de in a manner that will not result in the grant of  a new Stock Option or Stock 
Appreciation Right under Section 409A or cause the Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right to fail to  be exempt from 
Section 409A. 
  (d) Limits on Distribution.  Distribution of shares of Common Stock or other am ounts under the Plan shall be subject to the follow ing: 
  (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, th e Company shall have no liability to deliver any sh ares of Common Stock 
under the Plan or make any other distribution of be nefits under the Plan unless such delivery or distr ibution would comply 
with all applicable laws (including, without limita tion, the requirements of the Securities Act of 193 3), and the applicable 
requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity. 
  (ii) To the extent that the Plan provides for issua nce of stock certificates to reflect the issuance o f shares of Common Stock or 
Restricted Stock, the issuance may be effected on a  non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibit ed by applicable law or 
the applicable rules of any stock exchange. 
  (e) Stock Deposit Requirements and other Restrictions.  The Committee, in its discretion, may require as a  condition to the grant of 
Awards, the deposit of Common Stock owned by the Pa rticipant receiving such grant, and the forfeiture of such grant, if such 
deposit is not made or maintained during the requir ed holding period. Such shares of deposited Common Stock may not be 
otherwise sold or disposed of during the applicable  holding period or restricted period. The Committee  may also determine whether 
any shares issued upon exercise of a Stock Option o r Stock Appreciation Right, or attainment of any pe rformance goal, shall be 
restricted in any manner. 
6. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS TERMS A ND TYPE 
  (a) General.  Stock Options granted under the Plan shall be Non- Qualified Stock Options governed by Section 83 of t he Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The term of any Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Rig ht granted under the 
Plan shall be determined by the Committee, provided  that said term shall not exceed 10 years and one m onth. 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
For determining the amount of the payment, Common S tock delivered pursuant to (ii) or (iii) shall have  a value equal to the Fair 
Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of exe rcise.  
   
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be awarded on either a discretionary or performance-ba sed method.  
   
     (b) No Reload Rights.  Neither Stock Options nor Stock Appreciation Right s granted under this Plan shall contain any provisi on 
entitling the optionee or right-holder to the autom atic grant of additional options or rights in conne ction with any exercise of the 
original option or right. 
  (c) No Repricing.  Subject to Section 5(c) and absent stockholder app roval, the Exercise Price of an outstanding Stock O ption may not 
be decreased after the grant date; the value of Com mon Stock used to determine the amount paid upon th e exercise of a Stock 
Appreciation Right (i.e., the equivalent of an opti on’s exercise price) may not be decreased after the  date of grant; no outstanding 
Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be s urrendered to the Company as consideration or other wise for the grant of a 
new Award with a lower exercise price; and no other  modifications to any outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights 
may be made that would be treated as a “repricing” under the then applicable rules or listing requirem ents adopted by the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
7. GRANT, EXERCISE AND VESTING OF STOCK OPTIONS AND ST OCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS 
  (a) Grant.  Subject to the limits otherwise imposed by the ter ms of this Plan, the Committee has discretionary au thority to determine 
the size of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Ri ght Award, which may be tied to meeting performance -based requirements. 
  (b) Exercise.  Except as provided in Sections 11 and 12 (Change o f Control and Termination of Employment), each Stoc k Option or 
Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised only in a ccordance with the terms and conditions of the Stoc k Option grant or Stock 
Appreciation Right and during the periods as may be  established by the Committee. A Participant exerci sing a Stock Option or 
Stock Appreciation Right shall give notice to the C ompany of such exercise and of the number of shares  elected to be purchased 
prior to 4:30 P.M. CST/CDT on the day of exercise. 
  (c) Vesting.  Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be exercisable unless vested. Subject to Sectio ns 11 and 12 Stock 
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall be full y vested only after at least four years of the Part icipant’s continued service with 
the Company following the date of the grant. 
  (d) Payment of Exercise Price.  The Exercise Price for Stock Options shall be paid  to the Company at the time of such exercise, 
subject to any applicable rule adopted by the Commi ttee: 
  (i) in cash (including check, draft, money order or wir e transfer made payable to the order of the Company ); 
  (ii) through the tender of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant (by either actual delivery or at testation); 
  (iii) by a combination of (i) and (ii) above; or 
  (iv) by authorizing a third party broker to sell a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock acquire d upon exercise of the 
Stock Option and remit to the Company such sales pr oceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax  withholding 
resulting from the exercise.

Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Secti on, each Participant who receives Restricted Stock shall have certain rights as a

  (i) The Committee has exclusive authority to determ ine which Participants may be awarded performance-b ased Restricted 
Stock and Restricted Stock Units and whether any Re stricted Stock Unit Awards will be settled in share s of Common Stock, 
cash, or a combination thereof. 
  (ii) In order for any Participant to be awarded Res tricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units for a Perfo rmance Period (defined

each Participant eligible for a performance-based A ward shall be deemed to have earned an Award equal in value to the 
Maximum Amount, or such lesser amount as the Commit tee shall determine in its discretion to be appropr iate. The 
Committee may base this determination on performanc e-based criteria and in no case shall this have the  effect of increasing 
an Award payable to any other Participant. For purp oses of computing the value of Awards, each Restric ted Stock or 
Restricted Stock Unit shall be deemed to have a val ue equivalent to the Fair Market Value of one share  of Common Stock on 
the date the Award is granted.

shares of Common Stock. Each Participant who is awa rded Restricted Stock Units that are settled in cas h shall receive an amount equal to 
the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on  the date the applicable restricted period ends, mu ltiplied by the number of Units 
awarded. Participants who receive Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights as stockholders with res pect to such Restricted Stock Units 
until such time as share certificates for Common St ock are issued to the Participants (if applicable);  provided, however, that as of the first 
day of each quarter, during the applicable restrict ed period for all Restricted Stock Units awarded he reunder, the Company may credit to 
each such Participant an amount equal to the sum of  all dividends and other distributions paid by the Company during the prior quarter on 
that equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. N otwithstanding any provisions of this Section or th e Plan to the contrary, any 
dividends or other distributions paid on Restricted  Stock, or any dividend equivalents or other distri butions credited in respect to 
Restricted Stock Units, shall be distributed (in ei ther cash or shares of Common Stock, with or withou t interest or other earnings, as 
provided in the Award Agreement at the discretion o f the Committee) to the Participant only if, when, and to the extent the restrictions 
imposed on the attendant Restricted Stock or Restri cted Stock Units lapse, and in an amount equal to t he sum of all quarterly dividends 
and other distributions paid by the Company during the applicable restricted period on the equivalent number of shares of Common Stock 
which become unrestricted. Such dividends, dividend  equivalents, or other distributions shall be payab le at the same time as the attendant

rules relating to such deferrals intended to comply  with the requirements of Code section 409A, includ ing without limitation, the time 
when a deferral election can be made, the period of  the deferral, and the events that would result in payment of the deferred amount.

each Participant eligible for a Performance Award s hall be deemed to be granted an Award equal in valu e to the Maximum Amount, 
or such lesser amount as the Committee determines i n its discretion to be appropriate. The Committee m ay base this determination

made, the period of the deferral, and the events th at would result in payment of the deferred amount.  
   
The Company has the right to withhold amounts from Awards to satisfy required tax obligations as it de ems appropriate. Whenever the 
Company issues Common Stock under the Plan, unless it decides to satisfy the withholding obligations t hrough additional withholding on 
salary or other wages, it may require the recipient  to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to sa tisfy any Federal, state, local or 
foreign tax withholding requirements prior to the d elivery of such Common Stock, or the Company may in  its discretion withhold from 
the shares to be delivered shares sufficient to sat isfy all or a portion of such tax withholding requi rements.

the event of the Participant’s termination of emplo yment with the Company prior to the expiration of a ny service conditions, and/or

shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the previou s sentence, any dividend equivalents or other distr ibutions so credited shall 
be distributed (in either cash or shares of Common Stock, with or without interest or other earnings, as provided in the Award 
Agreement at the discretion of the Committee) to th e Participant only if, when, and to the extent the conditions imposed on the 
attendant Performance Share Units are satisfied, an d in an amount equal to the sum of all quarterly di vidends and other distributions

of the Company where such acquisition causes such P erson to own 20% or more of the combined voting pow er of the then 
outstanding voting  
   
   
   
   
     securities of the Company entitled to vote generall y in the election of directors (the “Outstanding Vo ting Securities”);

Change of Control: (A) any acquisition directly fro m the Company, (B) any acquisition by the Company, (C) any acquisition 
by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) spo nsored or maintained by the Company or any corporat ion controlled by 
the Company or (D) any acquisition by any corporati on pursuant to a transaction that complies with cla uses (A), (B) and 
(C) of subsection (iii) below; and provided, furthe r, that if any Person’s beneficial ownership of the  Outstanding Voting 
Securities reaches or exceeds 20% as a result of a transaction described in clause (A) or (B) above, a nd such Person 
subsequently acquires beneficial ownership of addit ional voting securities of the Company, such subseq uent acquisition shall 
be treated as an acquisition that causes such Perso n to own 20% or more of the Outstanding Voting Secu rities; or 
  (ii) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, consti tute the Board of Directors (the “Incumbent Board”)  cease for any reason to 
constitute at least a majority of the Board; provid ed, however, that any individual becoming a directo r subsequent to the date 
hereof whose election, or nomination for election b y the Company’s shareholders, was approved by a vot e of at least a 
majority of the directors then comprising the Incum bent Board shall be considered as though such indiv idual were a member 
of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this pur pose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a 
result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of director s or other actual or 
threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by o r on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or

Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Sec urities, (B) no Person (excluding any corporation r esulting from 
such Business Combination or any employee benefit p lan (or related trust) of the Company or such corpo ration resulting 
from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of, respectivel y, the then 
outstanding shares of common stock of the corporati on resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting 
power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to the extent that such own ership existed prior to 
the Business Combination and (C) at least a majorit y of the members of the board of directors of the c orporation resulting 
from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the  initial 
agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing  for such Business Combination; or 
  (iv) Approval by the stockholders of the Company of a co mplete liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 
  (b) If, within two years after a Change of Control a Participant experiences an involuntary separation  from service initiated by the 
Company for reasons other than “cause” (for this pu rpose cause shall have the same meaning as that ter m has in Section 4.2(b)(ii) 
of Plan B of the General Mills Separation Pay and B enefits Program for Officers), or a separation from  service for “good reason” 
actually entitling the employee to certain separati on benefits under Section 4.2(a)(ii) of Plan B of t he General Mills Separation Pay 
and Benefits Program for Officers, the following ap plies: 
  (i) All of his or her then outstanding and unvested  Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall fully vest immediately 
and remain exercisable for the one-year period begi nning on the date of his or her separation from ser vice or, if earlier, the 
end of the term of the Stock Option and Stock Appre ciation Right. 
   
   
Notwithstanding the above, any Restricted Stock Uni ts or Performance Awards subject to Section 409A (n ot subject to a proper 
deferral election) shall be settled on the Particip ant’s separation from service (within the meaning of Se ction 409A) or in the case of 
a Participant who is a “specified employee” (within  the meaning of Section 409A) on the first day of t he seventh month following 
the month of the Participant’s separation from serv ice.  
   
   
   
   
   
     (ii) All shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall fully vest and be settled immedia tely (subject to a proper 
deferral election made with respect to the Award). 
  (iii) All Performance Awards shall fully vest immed iately and shall be considered to be earned in full  “at target” as if the 
applicable performance goals established for the Ad ditional Performance Period have been achieved, and  paid immediately 
(subject to a proper deferral election made with re spect to the Award). 
  (iv) If Awards are replaced pursuant to subsection (d) below, the protections and rights granted under  this subsection (b) shall 
transfer and apply to such replacement awards. 
  (c) If, in the event of a Change of Control, and to  the extent outstanding Awards are not assumed by a  successor corporation (or 
affiliate thereto) or other successor entity or per son, or replaced with an award or grant that solely  in the discretionary judgment of 
the Committee, which shall be reasonable, preserves  the existing value of outstanding Awards at the ti me of the Change of Control, 
then the following shall occur: 
  (i) Subject to the other provisions of this subsect ion (c), All Stock Options and Stock Appreciation R ights shall vest and 
become exercisable immediately upon the Change of C ontrol event. 
  (ii) The restrictions on all shares of Restricted Stock shall lapse and Restricted Stock Units shall vest i mmediately. 
  (iii) All Performance Awards shall fully vest immed iately and shall be considered to be earned in full  “at target” as if the 
applicable performance goals established for the Ad ditional Performance Period have been achieved. 
  (iv) To the extent Code Section 409A applies, if th e Change of Control constitutes a “change in contro l” event as described in 
IRS regulations or other guidance under Code sectio n 409A(a)(2)(A)(v), Participants’ Restricted Stock Units and 
Performance Awards shall be settled and paid upon t he Change of Control in accordance with the require ments of Code 
Section 409A. 
  (v) If the Change of Control does not constitute a “change in control” event as described in IRS regul ations or other guidance 
under Code section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v), Restricted Sto ck Units and Performance Awards that are not Sectio n 409A Restricted 
Stock Units and/or not otherwise subject to Section  409A, and on which a deferral election was not mad e, shall be settled 
and paid upon the Change of Control. However, the S ection 409A Restricted Stock Units, Performance Awa rds otherwise 
subject to Section 409A, or such Awards for which a  proper deferral election was made, shall be settle d in cash equal to 
either the Award’s Fair Market Value at the time of  the Change of Control, or its monetary value provi ded for above in (iii), 
as applicable, plus interest at a rate of Prime plu s 1% from the Change of Control to the date of paym ent, which shall be the 
time the original restriction period would have clo sed, the Performance Award would have been original ly payable, or the 
date elected pursuant to the proper deferral electi on, as applicable. 
In the discretion of the Committee and notwithstand ing subsection (c)(i) above or any other Plan provi sion, outstanding Stock 
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (both exercis able and unexercisable) may be cancelled at the tim e of the Change of Control 
in exchange for cash, property, or a combination th ereof that is determined by the Committee to be at least equal to the excess (if 
any) of the value of the consideration that would b e received in such Change of Control by the holders  of Common Stock, over the 
exercise price for such Awards. For purposes of cla rification, by operation of this provision Stock Op tions and Stock Appreciation 
Rights that would not yield a gain at the time of t he Change of Control under the aforementioned equat ion are subject to 
cancellation without consideration. Furthermore, th e Committee is under no obligation to treat Awards and/or Participants 
uniformly and has the discretionary authority to tr eat Awards and Participants disparately.  
   
   
   
   
   
   
then the Participant’s Stock Options and Stock Appr eciation Rights shall terminate three months after such termination (but in no 
event beyond the original full term of the Stock Op tions or Stock Appreciation Rights) and no Stock Op tions or Stock Appreciation 
Rights shall become exercisable after such terminat ion, and all shares of Restricted Stock, Restricted  Stock Units which are subject 
to restriction on the date of termination, and all outstanding Performance Awards, shall be cancelled and forfeited.  
   
     (d) If in the event of a Change of Control and to t he extent outstanding Awards are assumed by any suc cessor corporation, affiliate 
thereof, person or other entity, or are replaced wi th awards that, solely in the discretionary judgmen t of the Committee preserve the 
existing value of outstanding Awards at the time of  the Change of Control and provide for vesting payo ut terms, and performance 
goals, as applicable, that are at least as favorabl e to Participants as vesting, payout terms and Perf ormance Goals applicable to 
Awards, then all such Awards or such substitutes th ereof shall remain outstanding and be governed by t heir respective terms, 
subject to Subsection 11(b) hereof. 
  (e) With respect to any outstanding Awards as of the da te of any Change of Control which require the depos it of owned Common Stock 
as a condition to obtaining rights, the deposit req uirement shall be terminated as of the date of the Change of Control.

  (i) the voluntary resignation of the Participant, or 
  (ii) a Company discharge due to Participant’s illeg al activities, poor work performance, misconduct or  violation of the 
Company ’s Code of Conduct, policies or practices, 
  (b) Other Termination.  If the Participant’s employment by the Company ter minates involuntarily at the initiation of the Comp any for

shall remain exercisable for the remaining full ter m of such Awards. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Section 409A Res tricted Stock Units that vest under this Section 12 (b) shall be paid on the

employee (within the meaning of Code section 409A) shall be paid on the first day of the seventh month  following the month of 
separation from service.  
An Award that otherwise would be settled under the terms of this section shall be forfeited if the gen eral release of claims provided

Upon execution of (and failure to revoked) the rele ase (i.e., upon its irrevocability), the Award shal l be settled within 90 days 
following the Participant’ s separation from service; provided, however, that if two calendar years could be spanned from the sta rt to 
the end of said 90- day period, settlement shall always be in the secon d calendar year regardless of when the release actu ally became 
irrevocable.  
     (ii) In the event that, at the time of such involun tary termination, the sum of the Participant’s age and years of service with the

Additional Performance Period shall be payable acco rding to the original terms of the Award with a val ue, if any, that 
otherwise would be earned under the applicable perf ormance goals originally established under the Awar d Agreement based 
on actual performance, and shall vest at the end of  the relevant Additional Performance Period in a pr o-rata amount based on 
the full months of employment completed during the relevant Additional Performance Period originally e stablished in the 
Award Agreement through the date of termination. Al l other Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, s hares of Restricted

under this Plan shall fully vest and become exercis able upon death and may be exercised by the person designated as such 
Participant’s beneficiary or beneficiaries or, in t he absence of such designation, by the Participant’ s estate. Stock Options and Stock 
Appreciation Rights shall remain exercisable for th e remaining full term of such Awards. A Participant  who dies while employed by 
the Company during any applicable restricted period  shall fully vest in such shares of Restricted Stoc k or Restricted Stock Units, 
effective as of the date of death, and such shares or cash shall be paid as of the first day of the mo nth following death to the

performance goals have been achieved, and paid on t he first day of the month following death to the de signated beneficiary or 
beneficiaries. 
A Restricted Stock Unit that could vest upon retire ment under this Section 12(d) at any time within th e Award’s restricted period 
shall be referred to as a “Section 409A Restricted Stock Unit”.  
Notwithstanding the above, the terms of this Sectio n 12(d) shall not apply to a Participant who, prior  to a Change of Control, is 
terminated for cause as described in Section 12(a)( ii); said Participant shall be treated as provided in Section 12(a).  
   
   
   
   
   
     (d) Retirement.  The Committee shall determine, at the time of gran t, the treatment of Awards upon the retirement of t he Participant. 
Unless other terms are specified in the original Aw ard Agreement, if the termination of employment is due to a Participant’s 
retirement on or after age 55 and completion of fiv e years of eligibility service under the General Mi lls Pension Plan, the Participant 
may, effective as of the date of employment termina tion as a retiree, exercise a Stock Option or Stock  Appreciation Right pursuant

or shares or cash attributable to Restricted Stock Units; and all Performance Awards shall fully vest and be payable according to the 
original terms of the Award with a value, if any, t hat otherwise would be earned under the applicable performance goals originally

Award). However, the Restricted Stock Units without  a proper deferral election that vest under this Se ction 12(d) shall be payable 
on the Participant’s separation from service (withi n the meaning of Section 409A) or in the case of a Participant who is a specified 
employee (within the meaning of Section 409A) shall  be paid on the first day of the seventh month foll owing the month of 
separation from service. 
  (e) Spin -offs and Other Divestitures.  If the termination of employment is due to the div estiture, cessation, transfer, or spin-off of a 
line of business or other activity of the Company, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determ ine the conversion, vesting, or 
other treatment of all outstanding Awards under the  Plan. Such treatment shall be consistent with Sect ion 409A, and in particular
