the company's practice not to incorporate adjustments into its financial outlook for proposed acquisitions, 
divestitures, ventures, pension risk transfer transactions, financing transactions, changes in law, or new 
accounting standards until such items have been consummated, enacted or adopted. For additional factors 
that may impact the company's actual results, refer to the “Forward-Looking Statements” section in this

1The company’s current 2023 financial outlook does not include any future gains or losses related to changes in valuations of the company's net 
assets and liabilities for deferred compensation plans or other investments. The outlook assumes continued accelerated payments to suppliers 
on an as needed basis, with a focus on small and at-risk businesses. In addition, the outlook reflects no significant reduction in customer 
budgets or changes in priorities, continued support and funding of the company’s programs, and a statutory tax rate of 21%. It also includes 
known impacts to the company and broader defense supply chain based on the company’s understanding at the time of this news release and 
its experience to date.
2Business segment operating profit and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of 
this news release for more information.
3Effective Jan. 1, 2023, the company no longer considers amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets in its evaluation of 
business segment operating performance. As a result, beginning on Jan 1. 2023, intangible asset amortization expense, which was previously 
included in business segment operating profit, will be reported in unallocated corporate expense within operating income.
4The total FAS/CAS pension adjustment is presented as a single amount and includes total expected U.S. Government cost accounting 
standards (CAS) pension cost of approximately $1.7 billion and total expected financial accounting standards (FAS) pension income of 
approximately $375 million. The company does not expect to make discretionary contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 
2023 . For additional detail regarding the pension amounts reported in operating and non-operating results, refer to the supplemental table 
included at the end of this news release.
Cash Flows and Capital Deployment Activities
Cash from operations in the first quarter of 2023  was $1.6 billion  and capital expenditures were 
$294 million , resulting in free cash flow of $1.3 billion . The increase in operating and free cash flows in the 
first quarter of 2023  compared to the first quarter of 2022 was primarily due to various changes in working 
capital, primarily production and billing cycles impacting contract assets and receivables (primarily F-35 
program at Aeronautics and missile programs at Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) ), partially offset by the 
timing of cash payments for accounts payable (primarily Aeronautics).

The company's cash activities in the first quarter of 2023 , included the following:
•paying cash dividends of $784 million ; and
•paying $500 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares (including 0.2 million shares received upon 
settlement of an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) in April 2023).

Segment Results
The company operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of products and 
services offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and

into the unallocated items line item to better align with how management views and manages the business. The 2022 amounts reflect the 
impact of this change.
Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and 
profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and not included in management’s evaluation of 
performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or 
losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are 
closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.
Business segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment, a portion of 
corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the 
applicable U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), 
and other items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance 
such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental 
costs, stock-based compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant 
asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, intangible asset amortization expense, and other 
6
miscellaneous corporate activities. Excluded items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated 
items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.
Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in 
volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production 
activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating 
profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, 
comparability of the company's segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted 
favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the company's contracts. Increases in 
profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments, usually relate to revisions in 
the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a 
particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an 
increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit 
booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. Increases or decreases in 
profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such 
changes. 
The company's consolidated net favorable profit booking rate adjustments represented approximately 
25% and 24% of total segment operating profit in the quarters ended March 26, 2023  and March 27, 
2022 .

Aeronautics' net sales in the first quarter of 2023  decreased  $132 million , or 2%, compared to the same 
period in 2022.  The decrease was  primarily attributable to lower net sales of $335 million for the F-35 
program due to lower volume on production contracts. This decrease was partially offset by higher sales of 
$135 million on classified programs due to higher volume and $70 million for the F-16 program due to  
higher production and sustainment volume.
 
Aeronautics ' operating profit in the first quarter of 2023  was compara ble to the same period in 2022.  
Operating  profit for the F-35 program was comparable as lower volume on production contracts was mostly 
offset by contract mix. Operating profit for the F-16 program was comparable as higher volume on 
production and sustainment contracts was offset by  higher unfavorable profit adjustments on a production 
contract and sustainment contracts . Total net profit booking rate adjustments were approximately $15 
million lower in t he first quarter of 2023  compared to the same period in 2022 .

MFC's net sales in the first quarter of 2023  decreased  $64 million , or 3%, compared to the same period in 
2022.  The d ecrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of $85 million for sensors and global 
sustainment programs as net sales for the first quarter of 2022 reflect the impact of a favorable profit 
adjustment on an international program as a result of a requirements modification that did not recur in the 
first quarter of 2023; and lower net sales of $60 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to lower 
volume (Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS)). These decreases were partially offset by 
higher net sales of $70 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to the impact of higher 
net favorable profit adjustments (Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3)).
 
MFC's operating profit in the first quarter of 2023  decreased  $8 million , or 2%, compared to the same 
period in 2022.  The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of $85 million for sensors 
and global sustainment programs due to the favorable profit adjustment on an international program in the 
first quarter of 2022 as described above. This decrease was partially offset by higher operating profit of $60 
million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to the impact of higher net favorable profit 
adjustments (PAC-3). In addition, operating margin was positively impacted when compared to the first 
quarter of 2022 due to contract mix at tactical and strike missi les. Total net profit booking rate adjustments 
were approximately $25 million lower  in the first quarter of 2023  compared to the same p eriod in 2022 .

programs due to lower production volume (Black Hawk); and lower net sales of $60 million for various 
C6ISR (command, control, communications, computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, 
and reconnaissance) programs due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by higher net 
sales of $85 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs due to higher volume 
(Aegis and TPY-4 programs).
RMS ' operating profit in the first quarter of 2023  decreased  $56 million , or 14%, compared to the same 
period in 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to  lower operating profit of $65 million for Sikorsky 
helicopter programs due to lower production volume, net favorable profit adjustments, and contract mix on 
the Black Hawk program and unfavorable profit adjustments (CH-53K). Total net profit booking rate 
adjustments were $35 million lower  in the first quarter of 2023  compared to the same period in 2022 .

Space's net sales in the first quarter of 2023  increased  $400 million , or 16%, compared to the same period 
in 2022.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $185 million for strategic and missile 
defense programs due to higher development volume (Next Generation Interceptor (NGI)); higher net sales 
of $170 million for national security space programs due to higher development volume (classified 
programs) and the impact of higher net favorable profit adjustments (Next Generation Overhead Persistent 
Infrared geosynchronous satellites (Next Gen OPIR) and classified programs); and higher net sales of $55 
million for commercial civil space programs due to higher volume (Orion).
 
Space's operating profit in the first quarter of 2023  increased  $32 million , or 13%, compared to the same 
period in 2022. The incr ease was  primarily attributable to higher operating profit of $70 million for national 
security space programs due to the impact of higher net favorable profit adjustments (Next Gen OPIR and 
classified programs). This increase was partially offset by $45 million of lower equity earnings from the 
company's investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA) due to lower launch volume and an increase in new 
product development costs. Total net profit booking rate adjustments were $85 million higher  in the first 
quarter of 2023  compared to the same period in 2022 .
Total equity (losses)/earnings (primarily ULA) represented approximately  $(15) million , or (5)% , of Space's 
operating profit in the first quarter of 2023 , compared to approximately $30 million , or 12%, in the first 
quarter of 2022 .

Income Taxes
The company's effective income tax rate was 15.3%  and 15.9%  for quarters ended March 26, 2023  and 
March 27, 2022 . The rates for both periods b enefited from research and development tax credits, tax 
deductions for foreign derived intangible income, dividends paid to the company's defined contribution 
plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and employee equity awards. The rate for the first 
quarter of 2023  compared to the first quarter of 2022 was lower primarily due to increased research and 
development tax credits. 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This news release contains the following non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) 
financial measures (as defined by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation G). While 
management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating the financial 
performance of the company, this information should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute 
for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company's definitions for non-
GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies or analysts.
Business segment operating profit
Business segment operating profit represents operating profit from the company's business segments 
before unallocated income and expense. This measure is used by the company's senior management in 
evaluating the performance of its business segments and is a performance goal in the company's annual 
incentive plan. Business segment operating margin is calculated by dividing business segment operating 
profit by sales. The table below reconciles the non-GAAP measure business segment operating profit with 
the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, consolidated operating profit.
(in millions)2023  Outlook
Business segment operating profit (non-GAAP) ~$7,255 - $7,355

expected non-service FAS pension income. Refer to the supplemental table "Selected Financial Data" included in this news release for a 
detail of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is cash from operations less capital expenditures. The company's capital expenditures are 
comprised of equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the 
development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized). The company uses free cash flow to 
evaluate its business performance and overall liquidity and it is a performance goal in the company's 
annual and long-term incentive plans. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure for 
investors because it represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the 
business and that may be available to return to stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock 
repurchases and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions or other investments. The entire free 
cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not 
account for certain mandatory expenditures, such as the repayment of maturing debt and pension 
contributions.
12
Adjusted earnings before income taxes; adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS
Earnings before income taxes, net earnings and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were impacted by certain 
non-operational items for all periods. Management believes the presentation of these measures adjusted 
for the impacts of these non-operational items is useful to investors in understanding the company’s 
underlying business performance and comparing performance from period to period. The tax effects related 
to each adjustment that impacted earnings before income taxes are based on a blended tax rate that 
combines the federal statutory rate of 21% plus an estimated state tax rate.
Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment – adjusted; Total FAS pension income - adjusted
Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment and Total FAS pension income have been adjusted for the noncash, 
non-operating pension settlement charge recorded in the second quarter 2022. Management believes that 
the exclusion of the pension settlement charge is useful to understanding the company’s underlying 
business performance and comparing performance from period to period.
