Item 1—Business
Costco
 Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. We are principallyengaged
 in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan,Australia,
 Spain, and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Marketunder the symbol “COST.”
We report on a
 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen, four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first threequarters
 consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). Thematerial
 seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2015,2014, and 2013 relate to the 52-week fiscal years en
ded August 30, 2015, August 31, 2014, and September 1, 2013, respectively.General
We
 operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded andprivate-label products in a wide range
 of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined withthe
 operating  efficiencies  achieved  by  volume  purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-servicewarehouse
 facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than most other retailers. Wegenerally
 sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts when available. To the extentthat sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, more inventory is fina
nced through payment terms provided by suppliers rather thanby our working capital.
We
 buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  a  cross-docking  consolidation  point  (depot)  or  directly  to  ourwarehous
es. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses.This
 process maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiple-step distributionchannels.

Table of ContentsItem 1—Business (Continued)
Our
 average warehouse space is approximately 144,000 square feet, however our newer units tend to be slightly larger. Floor plans are designedfor
 economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attractedprincipally by the quality of merchandise and 
the availability of low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances andexits
 of  our  warehouses  and  using  a  membership  format,  we  have  limited  inventory  losses  (shrinkage)  to  amounts  well  below  those  of  typicaldiscount retail operations.
Marketing
 activities for new locations generally include community outreach programs to local businesses in new and existing markets and directmail
 to  prospective  new  members.  Ongoing  promotional  programs  primarily  relate  to  coupon  mailers,  The  Costco  Connection  (a  magazine  wepublish for our members), and e-mails to members promoting selected merchandise.
Our
 warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours ofoperation
 are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to thevolume
 of  sales.  Merchandise  is  generally  stored  on  racks  above  the  sales  floor  and  displayed  on  pallets  containing  large  quantities,  therebyreducing labor required. In general, with variations by
 country, our warehouses accept cash, checks, certain debit and credit cards, or a private labelCostco credit card.
Our
 strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere.We
 seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 activestock
 keeping  units  (SKUs)  per  warehouse  in  our  core  warehouse  business,  significantly  less  than  other  broadline  retailers.  Many  consumableproducts are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.
In
 keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day
 return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverageis
 sold on certain electronic item purchases.The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major categoryof items:

Our
 online business, which operates websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Mexico, provides our members additional products, many not found inour
 warehouses.  These  products  vary  by  country  and  include  services  such  as  photo  processing,  pharmacy,  travel,  business  delivery,  andmembership services. Net sales for our online business were a
pproximately 3% of our net sales in each of the last three fiscal years.We
 have  direct  buying  relationships  with  many  producers  of  national  brand-name  merchandise.  We  do  not  obtain  a  significant  portion  ofmerchandi
se from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that ifone
 or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption ofour business.
 We also purchase private label merchandise, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our membersis greater as compared to brand-name items.
Certain
 financial  information  for  our  segments  and  geographic  areas  is  included  in  Note  11  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  inItem 8 of this Report.
Membership
Our
 format allows our members to utilize their memberships at any of our worldwide Costco warehouse locations. We have two types of members:Gold Star
 (individual) and Business. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, includingindividuals with a
 business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence. Business members have the ability to add additionalcardholders
 (add-ons). Add-ons are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $55 in our U.S. and Canadianoperations and varies by country in our Other International operati
ons. All paid memberships include a free household card.Our member renewal rate was approximately 
91% in the  U.S. and Canada, and approximately 88% on a worldwide basis in 2015 . The renewal rate is
 a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. The majority  of membersrenew within the six months following their rene
wal date.Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):
 
2015   2014   2013 Gold Star
34,000   31,600   28,900 Business, including add-ons
10,600   10,400   10,100      Total paid members
44,600   42,000   39,000 Household cards
36,700   34,400   32,200 Total cardholders
81,300   76,400   71,200 All
 Gold Star and Business paid cardholders are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and U.K., for anadditional
 annual fee of approximately $55. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward ofapproximately
 $750 per year), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico) additional savingsand
 benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program and check printingservices.
 The  services  are  generally  provided  by  third-parties  and  vary  by  country  and  state.  Executive  members  represented 39% of  eligiblecardholders
 at the end of 2015 and 2014 and 38% at  the end of 2013 .  Executive members generally spend more than other members, and thepercentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increas

Labor
Our employee count was as follows:
 
2015   2014   2013 Full-time employees
117,000   112,000   103,000 Part-time employees
88,000   83,000   81,000 Total employees
205,000   195,000   184,000 Approximately 
14,000 employees  in  a  minority  of  our  locations  are  represented  by  the  International  Brotherhood  of  Teamsters.  All  remainingemployees are non-union. We consider our empl
oyee relations to be very good.Competition
Our
 industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location and customer service. We competewith
 warehouse club operations across the U.S. and Mexico (primarily Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and nearly every majormetropolitan
 area has multiple club operations. In addition, we compete on a worldwide basis with global, national and regional wholesalers andretailers,
 including supermarkets, supercenters, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet retailers. Competitors such as Wal-Mart,
 Target, Kroger, and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with operators selling asingle category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Low
e’s, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Kohl’s, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods,CVS, Walgreens, and Best Buy.
Intellectual Property
We
 believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress, domainnames
 and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in thedevelopment
 and  protection  of  our  well-recognized  brands,  including  the  Costco  Wholesale ® series  of  trademarks  and  our  private  label  brand,Kirkland
 Signature ® . We believe that Kirkland Signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lowerthan
 those  for  similar  national  brand  products  and  that  they  help  lower  costs,  differentiate  our  merchandise  offerings  from  other  retailers,  andgenerally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to incre
ase the sales penetration of our private label items.We
 rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employeesand
 others to protect our intellectual property rights. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarksare generally valid and may be renew
ed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.Available Information

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors
The
 risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not theonly
 risks that we face. We could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well asother
 risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed inconjunction with Management 
'  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item    7 and our consolidated financialstatements and related notes in Item 
   8 of this Report.Business and Operating Risks
We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.
Our
 financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 88% and 85% of net salesand operating income in 2015, respectively. Within 
the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 31% of U.S. netsales in
 2015. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets.Any
 substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines infinancial
 performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: declinesin
 actual  or  estimated  comparable  warehouse  sales  growth  rates  and  expectations;  negative  trends  in  operating  expenses,  including  increasedlabor,
 healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts insales
 mix  toward  lower  gross  margin  products;  changes  or  uncertainties  in  economic  conditions  in  our  markets,  including  higher  levels  ofunemployment
 and  depressed  home  values;  and  failing  to  consistently  provide  high  quality  products  and  innovative  new  products  to  retain  ourexisting member base and attract new members.
We
 may  be  unsuccessful  implementing  our  growth  strategy,  including  expanding  our  business,  both  in  existing  markets  and  in  newmarkets, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
 growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and regional depots. We compete with otherretailers
 and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehousesand
 depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local lawsrestricting
 our  operations  and  environmental  regulations,  may  impact  our  ability  to  find  suitable  locations,  and  increase  the  cost  of  sites  and  ofconstructin
g, leasing and operating our warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreementson
 acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation orexpansion
 plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. Failure to manage these and other similarfactors
 effectively may affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on ourfuture growth and profitability.
We
 seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members awayfrom our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable w
arehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses.We
 intend  to  continue  to  open  warehouses  in  new  markets.  The  risks  associated  with  entering  a  new  market  include  difficulties  in  attractingmembers
 due  to  a  lack  of  familiarity  with  us,  attracting  members  of  other  wholesale  club  operators,  our  lack  of  familiarity  with  local  memberpreferences,
 and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or withexisting
 competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that our new warehouses and new online business websites willbe profitably deployed and, as a result, our future profitability cou
ld be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.8

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
Our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.
Membership
 loyalty and growth are essential to our business model. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase thepenetration
 of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputationmay
 negatively impact comparable warehouse sales, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales andmembership fee revenue, negatively impacting o
ur results of operations.In
 addition, we sell many products under our private label Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, andavailability
 of our  Kirkland Signature  products  for  our  members  is essential  to  developing and maintaining  member  loyalty.  These products  alsogenerally
 carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If theKirkland Signature brand experi
ences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.Disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.
We
 depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. Although we believe thatour
 receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophicevents, labor
 issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affectsales and the satisfaction of our members.
We
 rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business. Failure to adequatelyupdate
 our systems and disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could harm our ability to run our business and adverselyaffect our results of operations.
Given
 the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-criticalcomputer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are
 subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer andtelecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal
 or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes andhurricane
s, and errors by our employees. If our computer systems or our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may haveto
 make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption inour computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operati
ons.We
 are  currently  making,  and  will  continue  to  make,  significant  technology  investments  to  improve  or  replace  our  information  processes  andsystems that
 are key to managing our business. Failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace would beharmful.
 The  risk  of  system  disruption  is  increased  when  significant  system  changes  are  undertaken,  although  we  believe  that  our  changemanagement
 process can mitigate this risk. Excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it moredifficult
 for  us  to  realize  benefits  from  the  technology.  Targeting  the  wrong  opportunities,  failing  to  make  the  best  investments,  or  making  aninvestment commitment
 significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financialcondition
 and results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives coulddisrupt
 or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide themon a delayed schedule or at a high
er cost.If
 we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related and other business information, we could damage our reputation withmembers, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.
We
 receive, retain, and transmit certain personal information about our members and entrust that information to third party business associates,including cloud service provi
ders that perform activities for us. Our online9

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
business,
 which  operates  websites  in  the  U.S.,  Canada,  U.K.,  and  Mexico,  depends  upon  the  secure  transmission  of  encrypted  confidentialinformation
 over  public  networks,  including  information  permitting  cashless  payments.  A  compromise  of  our  security  systems  or  those  of  ourbusiness associates
 that results in our members '  information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with ourmembers
 and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or theimposition
 of  penalties.  In  addition,  a  security  breach  could  require  that  we  expend  significant  additional  resources  related  to  the  security  ofinformation systems and could result in a disruption of our operatio
ns.The
 use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries.   Privacy
 and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systemschanges
 and the development of new administrative processes. If we, or those with whom we share information, fail to comply with these laws andregulations
 or  experience  a  data  security  breach,  our  reputation  could  be  damaged,  possibly  resulting  in  lost  future  business,  and  we  could  besubjected to additional leg
al risk as a result of non-compliance.Our
 security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result anunauthorized
 party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. In July 2015, we discovered thatthe
 company that hosts our online photo center suffered a security breach that compromised information of users of the company's site, includingsome Costco members. In
 response, that company implemented new technology with enhanced security features. Additional data security breachesmay
 occur in the future and may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Because thetechniques
 used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access,  disable  or  degrade  service,  or  sabotage  systems  change  frequently  and  may  not  immediatelyproduce
 signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, or implement adequate preventativemeasures. Any such breach or unauthorized access coul
d result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentiallyhave an adverse effect on our business.
We are subject to payment related risks.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash an
d checks, a select variety of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card.As
 we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraudlosses. For
 certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing feeswhich
 may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services, includingthe
 processing of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card, and it could temporarily disrupt our business if these companies becomeunwilling
 or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules, includingdata
 security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change over time. If we fail to comply withthese
 rules or transaction processing requirements, we may not be able to accept certain payment methods. In addition, if our internal systems arebreached
 or compromised, we may be liable for banks' compromised card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and loseour ability to accept credit and/or debit card payments from our members, and our business and operati
ng results could be adversely affected.We might sell unsafe products, resulting in illness or injury 
to our members, harm our reputation, and litigation.If
 our merchandise offerings, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children '  s products, pet products, anddurable
 goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members '  expectations regarding safety, we couldexperience
 lost sales, increased costs, and legal and reputational losses. The sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injuryto our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauth
orized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including thepresence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other
10

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
agents,
 or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our vendors aregenerally
 contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buycomply
 with all safety standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects withapplicable
 laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause a health-related illness or injury in thefuture
 or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls andother
 liabilities  that  could  adversely  affect  our  business  and  results  of  operations.  Even  if  a  product  liability  claim  is  unsuccessful  or  is  not  fullypursued, the negative publicity surround
ing any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existingand potential members and our corporate and brand ima
ge, and these effects could be long term.We
 may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members,the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
It
 is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our abilityto
 identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumertastes,
 preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) and spending patterns could negatively affectour
 relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our salestrends
 and  adjusting  our  purchases  accordingly,  we  may  have  excess  inventory,  which  could  result  in  additional  markdowns  and  reduce  ouroperating performance. This could have an adv
erse effect on gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) and operating income.If
 we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could beadversely impacted.
Multichannel
 retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors.Our
 members, especially younger members, are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to shop. As part of ourmultichannel
 strategy,  we  are  making  technology  investments  in  our  websites  and  mobile  applications.  If  we  are  unable  to  make,  improve,  ordevelop relevant member-facing technolo
gy in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our inability
 to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.
Our
 success  depends  on  the  continued  contributions  of  members  of  our  senior  management  and  other  key  operations,  merchandising  andadministrative
 personnel, and the loss of these contributions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We must attract, train and retaina
 large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control laborand
 benefit costs is subject to numerous external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurancecosts.
 We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them.There is
 no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect onour business, financial conditio
n and results of operations.Market and Other External Risks
We
 face  strong  competition  from  other  retailers  and  warehouse  club  operators,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and results of operations.
The retail business is
 highly competitive. We compete for customers, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with awide
 range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouseclub operators, supermarkets,
11

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
supercenters,
 department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet retailers. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in avariety
 of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, and store hours. The evolution of retailingin
 online and mobile  channels  has improved  the  ability  of  customers  to  comparison  shop with  digital  devices,  which has enhanced competition.Some
 competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability torespond
 effectively  to  competitive  pressures,  changes  in  the  retail  markets  and  member  expectations  could  result  in  lost  market  share  andnegatively affect our financial results.
General
 economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  ofoperations.
Higher
 energy  and  gasoline  costs,  inflation,  levels  of  unemployment,  healthcare  costs,  consumer  debt  levels,  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,unsettled
 financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes related to government fiscaland tax policies, sovereign debt crises,
 and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a changein
 the mix of products we sell. Prices of certain commodity products, including gasoline and other food products, are historically volatile and aresubject
 to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in  domestic  and  international  supply  and  demand,  labor  costs,  competition,  market  speculation,government
 regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profitmargins. These
 factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affectour
 operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significantnational or international events.
Vendors
 may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our highstandards resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.
We
 depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As these quantities continue to grow, wehave
 no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sellsto us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchan
dise leading to loss of sales and profits.We
 purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships. Ourinability
 to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to developrelations
hips with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existingvendors.
 Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, thelarge volume we demand may not be consistently ava
ilable.Our
 suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities,financial
 liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their abilityto
 timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control,legal,
 regulatory or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identifiedbefore
 we  sell  such  merchandise  to  our  members.  This  failure  could  lead  to  litigation  and  recalls,  which  could  damage  our  reputation  and  ourbrands, increase our costs, and otherwise adversely impact our busi
ness.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
During
 2015, our  international  operations,  including Canada,  generated  27% and 36% of  our  net sales  and operating  income,  respectively.  Ourinternational
 operations have accounted for an increasingly larger portion of our warehouses and we plan to continue expanding our internationaloperations. Our operations in
12

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
countries
 other  than  the  U.S.  are  conducted  primarily  in  the  local  currencies  of  those  countries.  Our  consolidated  financial  statements  aredenominated
 in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the results of operations of our international operationsfrom
 local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. As a result of such translations, future fluctuations in currencyexchange
 rates  over  time  that  are  unfavorable  to  us  may  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of  our  Canadian  and  Other  Internationaloperating
 segments  and  have  a  corresponding  adverse  period-over-period  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  As  we  continue  to  expand  ourinternational operations, our exposure to fluctuati
ons in foreign exchange rates may increase.We
 may pay for products we purchase for sale in our warehouses around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country inwhich
 the  goods  will  be  sold.  Currency  fluctuations  may  increase  our  cost  of  goods  and  may  not  be  passed  on  to  members.  Consequently,fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Natural
 disasters, such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes, particularly in California or in Washington state, where our centralized operatingsystems
 and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result inphysical
 damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequatework
 force  in  a  market,  the  temporary  or  long-term  disruption  in  the  supply  of  products  from  some  local  or  overseas  suppliers,  the  temporarydisruption in the transport of
 goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which weoperate, and the temporary reduction in the availabi
lity of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad,could
 disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidencelevels.
 These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers. We may berequired
 to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.
Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
We
 use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Increased U.S. and foreign government andagency
 regulations  to  limit  carbon  dioxide  and  other  greenhouse  gas  emissions  may  result  in  increased  compliance  costs  and  legislation  orregulation
 affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure neededcommodities
 at  costs  and  in  quantities  we  currently  experience.  We  also  sell  a  substantial  amount  of  gasoline,  the  demand  for  which  could  beimpacted
 by  concerns  about  climate  change  and  which  also  could  face  increased  regulation.  Climate  change  may  be  associated  with  extremeweather
 conditions, such  as  more  intense  hurricanes,  thunderstorms,  tornadoes,  and  snow  or  ice  storms,  as  well  as  rising  sea  levels.  Extremeweather conditions increase our costs and dama
ge resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We
 believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay inmeeting
 these  expectations,  including  our  comparable  warehouse  sales  growth  rates,  gross  margin,  earnings  and  earnings  per  share  or  newwarehouse openings cou
ld cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies.13

Legal and Regulatory Risks
Our
 international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economicfactors specific to the countrie
s or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and resultsof operations.
During
 2015, we operated 206 warehouses in eight countries outside of the U.S. and we plan to continue expanding our international operations.Future
 operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain ofwhich are
 beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, and othermatters
 in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations includeforeign
 trade, monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations,and
 risks  associated  with  having  major  facilities  located  in  countries  which  have  been  historically  less  stable  than  the  U.S.  Risks  inherent  ininternational
 operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, andgreater difficulty in enforcing intellectual prop
erty rights.Changes
 in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accountingmatters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Accounting
 principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of mattersthat
 are  relevant  to  our  business,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  revenue  recognition,  merchandise  inventories,  vendor  rebates  and  other  vendorconsideration,
 impairment  of  long-lived  assets,  self-insurance  liabilities,  and  income  taxes  are  highly  complex  and  involve  many  subjectiveassumptions,
 estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions,estimates or judgments by our management could significa
ntly change our reported or expected financial performance.Provisions
 for  losses  related  to  self-insured  risks  are  generally  based  upon  independent  actuarially  determined  estimates.  The  assumptionsunderlying
 the  ultimate  costs  of  existing  claim  losses  can  be  highly  unpredictable,  which  can  affect  the  liability  recorded  for  such  claims.  Forexample,
 variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trendsand
 interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates ofliabilities
 incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect uponfuture claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and co
uld materially impact our consolidated financial statements.We could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.
We
 compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among countries, achange
 in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision.Additionally,
 changes in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in connection with income tax audits in any jurisdiction, including transfer pricingdisputes,
 or  any  change  in  the  pronouncements  relating  to  accounting  for  income  taxes  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financialcondition and results of operations.
Significant
 changes in, or failure to comply with, federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use,storage,
 discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters couldadversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We
 are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge anddisposal
 of  hazardous  materials,  hazardous  and  non-hazardous  wastes  and  other  environmental  matters.  Any  failure  to  comply  with  these  lawscould result in significant costs to satisfy environmental compli
ance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of14

Table of ContentsItem 1A—Risk Factors (Continued)
severe
 penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition andresults of operations.
We
 are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.
Our
 business  requires  compliance  with  many  laws  and  regulations.  Failure  to  achieve  compliance  could  subject  us  to  lawsuits  and  otherproceedings,
 and  lead  to  damage  awards,  fines,  penalties,  and  remediation  costs.  We  are,  or  may  become  involved,  in  a  number  of  legalproceedings
 and  audits  including  grand  jury  investigations,  government  and  agency  investigations,  and  consumer,  employment,  tort,  unclaimedproperty
 laws, and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item    8 ofthis Report). We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedin
gs and other contingencies, including environmental remediationand
 other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws,and
 other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us topay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financ
ial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuitsand proceedings may involve sig
nificant expense and diversion of management '  s attention and resources.Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments

OVERVIEW
We
 believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales) growth.We
 define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well asonline
 sales related to websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequencyfrom new
 and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced bycertain
 factors  that  are  beyond  our  control:  fluctuations  in  currency  exchange  rates  (with  respect  to  the  consolidation  of  the  results  of  ourinternational
 operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting our U.S. and Canadianoperations).
 The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrativeexpenses,
 reducing  them  as  a  percentage  of  sales  and  enhancing  profitability.  Generating  comparable  sales  growth  is  foremost  a  question  ofmaking
 available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the longterm.
 Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the United States. Sales growthand
 gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regionalwholesalers
 and retailers. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we havebeen
 successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix,including increasing the p
enetration of our private label items.Our
 philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term onmaximizing
 prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our  members  of  our  “pricing  authority”  –consistently
 providing  the  most  competitive  values.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  can,  from  time  to  time,  include  reducing  prices  onmerchandise
 to  drive  sales  or  meet  competition  and  holding  prices  steady  despite  cost  increases  instead  of  passing  the  increases  on  to  ourmembers,
 all negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe that our gasolinebusiness
 draws  members  but  it  generally  has  a  significantly  lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  non-gasoline  business.  A  higherpenetration
 of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term
 net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our grossmargin
 percentage but decreases our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices hasthe inverse effect.
We
 also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become moredifficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial compo
nent of growth. The negative aspects of such growth,however,
 including  lower  initial  operating  profitability  relative  to  existing  warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  whenopenings
 occur in existing markets, are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growthis higher in foreign markets,
 due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our online business growth both domesticallyand internationally has also i
ncreased our sales.Our
 membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforcemember
 loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase penetration of ourExecutive members, and sustain high renewal rates, materially i
nfluences our profitability.Our financial performance depends heavi
ly on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically,some
 significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to expenses relating to thecompensation of our

(Continued) employees,
 our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-termobjectives
 of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than theindustry
 average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through totheir
 workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularlygross margin and selling, general an
d administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.Our
 operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidatedfinancial
 statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of squarefootage
 growth,  lower  wages  and  benefit  costs  as  a  percentage  of  country  sales,  and/or  less  or  no  direct  membership  warehouse  competition.Additionally, we operate our low
er-margin gasoline business in the U.S., Canada, Australia, U.K., and Japan.In
 discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which arereferences
 to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from localcurrencies
 into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the differencebetween
 the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year period's currency exchange rates. We also refer to the impactof
 changes in gasoline prices on our net sales. This impact is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average gasolineprice per gallon sold and the comparab
le prior-year period's average gasoline price per gallon sold.Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal years 
2015 , 2014 and 2013 were 52-week fiscal years ending on August 30, 2015 , August
 31, 2014 and September 1, 2013 ,  respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unlessotherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.
Highlights for fi
scal year 2015 included:•
We opened 23 net new warehouses in 2015, 12 in the U.S., one in Canada, and 10 in our Other International segment, compared to 29 netnew warehouses in 2014;
•
Net sales increased 3% to $113,666, driven by sales at new warehouses opened in 2014 and 2015, and a 1% increase in comparable sales.Net
 and comparable sales results were negatively impacted by changes in all foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreases inthe price of gasoline;
•
Membership  fee  revenue  increased  4% to  $2,533,  primarily  due  to  membership  sign-ups  at  existing  and  new  warehouses  and  executivemembership upgrades, partially offset by the negative impact of chang
es in all foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar;•
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased 43 basis points, primarily from the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales as wellas higher gross margins in our gasoline bus
iness;•
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 18 basis points;•
Net income increased to $2,377, or $5.37 per diluted share compared to $2,058, or $4.65 per diluted share in 2014. The current year resultswere
 positively impacted by a $57 tax benefit, or $0.13 per diluted share, in connection with the special cash dividend paid to the Company's401(k) Plan participants;
•
Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.28, primarily due to changes inthe Canadian dollar;
•
In February 2015, we issued $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which partially funded a special cash dividend of $5.00per share paid in February 2015 (approximately $
2,201); and•
The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.355 to $0.40 per share in April 2015.20

Net Sales
Net
 sales increased $7,342 or 7% during 2014. This was attributable to a 4% increase in comparable warehouse sales, and sales at warehousesopened
 in 2013 and 2014. Changes in foreign currencies negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,336, or 130 basis points, compared to2013.
 The  negative  impact  was  primarily  due  to  the  Canadian  dollar  of  approximately  $1,140  and  the  Japanese  yen  of  approximately  $311.Changes
 in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately $364, or 35 basis points, due to a 3% decrease in the average salesprice per gallon.
Comparable Sales
Comparable
 sales increased 4% during 2014 and were primarily impacted by an increase in shopping frequency. Changes in foreign currenciesrelative
 to the U.S. dollar and gasoline prices negatively impacted comparable sales results, including the average ticket during 2014. The increasein
 comparable  sales  also  includes  the  negative  impact  of  cannibalization  (established  warehouses  losing  sales  to  our  newly  opened  locations),primarily in our Other International operations.

Membership
 fees increased 4% in 2015. This increase was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and increasednumber
 of  upgrades  to  our  higher-fee  Executive  Membership  program.  These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  changes  in  foreign  currenciesrelative
 to the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately $76 in 2015. Our member renewal rates are currently 91%in the U.S. and

 2015,  the  gross  margin  of  our  combined  core  merchandise  categories  (food  and  sundries,  hardlines,  softlines  and  fresh  foods),  whenexpressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased five basis points, primarily due to increases in softlines
and
 food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and grossmargins from our warehouse ancillary and other busin
esses.Our
 gross margin percentage increased 43 basis points compared to 2014 and most of the improvement was derived from the impact of gasolineprice
 deflation on net sales. Excluding this impact, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.81%, an increase of 15 basis pointsfrom
 the prior year. This increase is predominantly due to: an increase in our warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin of 23 basispoints,
 due primarily to our gasoline business; partially offset by a negative contribution from core merchandise categories of 12 basis points, as aresult
 of a decrease in their sales penetration. A LIFO benefit in 2015 compared to a charge in 2014 positively contributed five basis points. TheLIFO
 benefit  resulted  largely  from  lower  costs  for  gasoline.  Changes  in  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  negatively  impacted  grossmargin by approximately $359 in 2015.
Gross
 margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased inour

 operating costs of three basis points primarily due to continued investment in modernizing our information systems, primarily incurred by ourU.S.
 operations. Stock compensation expense was also higher by two basis points due to accelerated vesting for long service and appreciation inthe
 trading price of our stock at the time of grant, despite a 14% reduction in the average number of restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to eachparticipant.
 Warehouse operating costs were lower by one basis point, primarily resulting from improvements in payroll in our Canadian operationsas

es(2,324 )  (786 ) 44 Our
 primary  sources  of  liquidity  are  cash  flows  generated  from  warehouse  operations,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investmentbalances.
 Cash and cash equivalents and short-term  investments were $6,419 and $7,315 at the end of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of thesebalances,
 approximately  $1,243  and  $1,383  at  the  end  of  2015  and  2014,  respectively,  represented  debit  and  credit  card  receivables,  primarilyrelated
 to sales in the last week of our fiscal year. Cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates by $418 and$11, respectively.
We
 have  not  provided  for  U.S.  deferred  taxes  on  cumulative  undistributed  earnings  of  certain  non-U.S.  consolidated  subsidiaries  because  oursubsidiaries have invested or wil
l invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings if repatriated would not result in a deferred tax liability.This
 includes the remaining undistributed earnings of our Canadian operations that management maintains are indefinitely reinvested, or could berepatriated
 without resulting in a deferred tax liability. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine thatsuch earnings are no longer indefi
nitely reinvested.During
 2015, we repatriated a portion of the earnings in our Canadian operations that in 2014 were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. Inthe
 fourth quarter of 2015, we changed our position regarding an additional portion of the undistributed earnings of our Canadian operations, whichare
 no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. Current exchange rates compared to historical rates when these earnings were generated resultedin an immaterial U.S. tax benefit, which was recorded at the end of 2015.
Management
 believes  that  our  cash  position  and  operating  cash  flows  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  liquidity  and  capital  requirements  for  theforeseeable
 future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements and have nocurrent
 plans  to  repatriate  for  use  in  the  U.S.  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  held  by  these  non-U.S.  consolidatedsubsidiaries
 whose  earnings  are  considered  indefinitely  reinvested.  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  held  at  thesesubsidiaries and considere
d to be indefinitely reinvested totaled $1,196 at August 30, 2015.Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net
 cash provided by operating activities totaled $4,285 in 2015 compared to $3,984 in 2014. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarilyderived
 from  net  sales  and  membership  fees.  Our  cash  flow  used  in  operations  generally  consists  of  payments  to  our  merchandise  vendors,warehouse
 operating costs including payroll and employee benefits, credit card processing fees, and utilities. Cash used in operations also includespayments for income taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activitie
s for 2015 when compared to 2014 was primarily due to strongerearnings.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $
2,480 in 2015 compared to $2,093 in 2014. Our cash flow used in investing activities is primarily relatedto
 funding our warehouse expansion and remodeling activities. Net  cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities ofshort-term investments.
Capital Expenditure Plans
We
 opened 23 new warehous es,  relocated two warehouses, and converted an existing warehouse to a business center in 2015 and plan to openup to 32 new warehouses in 2016 a
nd relocate up to five26

(Continued) warehouses. Our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land, bu
ildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent,capital
 is required for initial warehouse operations, the modernization of our information systems, and working capital. In  2015 we spent $2,393 oncapital expenditures,
 and it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,800 to $3,000 during fiscal 2016. These expenditures  are expected tobe
 financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. There can be no assurance that currentexpectations will be realized a
nd plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activiti
es totaled $2,324 in 2015 compared to $786 in 2014. The primary uses of cash in 2015 were dividend payments of$2,865,
 which includes a $5.00 per share special cash dividend, repurchases of common stock, and payment of withholding taxes on stock-basedawards. Net cash used in financing activities w
as partially offset by the issuance of $1,000 in Senior Notes.In
 February 2015, we issued $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes as follows: $500 of 1.75% Senior Notes due February 15, 2020,and
 $500 of 2.25% Senior Notes due February 15, 2022. The proceeds were used to pay a portion of the special cash dividend on February 27,2015.
Stock Repurchase Programs
In
 April  2015,  our  Board  of  Directors  authorized  a  new  share  repurchase  program  in  the  amount  of  $4,000,  which  expires  in  April  2019.  Thisauthorization
 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts, totaling $2,528. During 2015 and 2014, we repurchased 3,456,000 and 2,915,000shares
 of common stock, at an average price of $142.87 and $114.45, totaling approximately $494 and $334, respectively. The remaining amountavailab
le to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,699 at the end of 2015. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, inthe
 open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with theWashington Business Corporation Act.
Dividends
Our
 cash dividends paid in 2015 totaled  $6.51 per share, as compared to $1.33 per share in 2014 .  In April 2015, our Board of Directors increasedour
 quarterly cash dividend from $0.355 to $0.40 per share. Additionally, in 2015, our Board of Directors declared and paid a special cash dividendof $5.00 per share, totaling approximately $2,201.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We
 maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At August 30, 2015, we had borrowing capacity within thesefacilities
 of $407, of which $337 was maintained by our international operations. Of the $337, $153 is guaranteed by the Company. There were nooutstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the en
d of 2015 and 2014.The
 Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $149. The outstanding commitments under thesefacilitie
s at the end of 2015 totaled $90, including $89 in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities havevarious
 expiration dates, all within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration. The amount of borrowingsavailable at any time under our bank credit faciliti
es is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding.27

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We
 have no off-balance sheet arrangements that in the opinion of management have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current orfuture effect on our financial condition or consolid
ated financial statements.Critical Accounting Estimates
The
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requiresthat
 we make estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long-livedassets, insurance/self-insurance liabil
ities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe tobe reasonable and we continue to 
review and evaluate these statements. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion inNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements inc
luded in Item 8 of this Report.Revenue Recognition
We
 generally  recognize  sales,  which  include  shipping  fees  where  applicable,  net  of  returns,  at  the  time  the  member  takes  possession  ofmerchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of
services,
 the amount is generally recorded as deferred sales in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We providefor estimated sales returns based on historical trends and reduce sal
es and merchandise costs28

Table of ContentsItem 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
(amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) 
(Continued) accordingly.
 Our  sales  returns  reserve  is  based  on  an  estimate  of  the  net  realizable  value  of  merchandise  inventories  to  be  returned.  Amountscollected from members for sales and value added taxes are recorded on a n
et basis.We
 evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or a net amount. Generally, when we arethe
 primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications,or
 have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess otherindicators
 of gross reporting as noted above, we record a net amount, which is reflected in net sales. We record related shipping fees on a grossbasis.
We
 account for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over one-year. Our Executivemembers qualify for a
 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of approximately $750 per year), which can be redeemed only atCostco
 warehouses. We account for this reward as a reduction in sales. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after givingeffect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise
 inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using thelast-in,
 first-out  (LIFO)  method  for  substantially  all  U.S.  merchandise  inventories.  We  record  an  adjustment  each  quarter,  if  necessary,  for  theestimated
 effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. We believe the LIFO methodmore
 fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. Merchandise inventories for all foreignoperations are primarily valued by the retail inve
ntory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.We
 provide  for  estimated  inventory  losses  (shrink)  between  physical  inventory  counts  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales.  The  provision  is  adjustedperiodically to reflect results of the actual physical inve
ntory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year.Inventory
 cost,  where  appropriate,  is  reduced  by  estimates  of  vendor  rebates  when  earned  or  as  we  progress  toward  earning  those  rebates,provided
 they  are  probable  and  reasonably  estimable.  Other  consideration  received  from  vendors  is  generally  recorded  as  a  reduction  ofmerchandise costs upon completion of contractual milesto
nes, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We
 evaluate  our  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  on  an  annual  basis,  when  relocating  or  closing  a  facility,  or  when  events  or  changes  incircumstanc
es occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. Ourjudgments
 are  based  on  existing  market  and  operational  conditions.  Future  events  could  cause  us  to  conclude  that  impairment  factors  exist,requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair value.
Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities
We
 use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including for certain risks, a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary andparticipation
 in a reinsurance program, to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ andofficers’
 liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and areestimated, in part, by
 considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimatedaccruals for these liabilities could be si
gnificantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.Income Taxes
The
 determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application ofcomplex tax laws. Significant judgment is require
d in assessing the29

Table of ContentsItem 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
(amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) 
(Continued) timing
 and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertaintax
 positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the positions willwithstand
 challenge from tax authorities. Additionally, certain of our cumulative foreign undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested.These
 earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if we changed our position and could result in a U.S. deferred tax liability. When facts andcircumstances change, we reassess these positions an
d record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate.Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to the consolidated financi
al statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)
Our
 exposure  to  financial  market  risk  results  from  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  We  do  not  engage  inspeculative or leveraged transactions or hol
d or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Interest Rate Risk
Our
 exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instrumentsconsidered
 to be cash equivalents as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term
 investments  in  government  and  agency  securities,  and  asset  and  mortgage-backed  securities  with  effective  maturities  of  generally  threemonths
 to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generateyields.
 The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due tointerest rate fluctuations.
Our
 Board of Directors have approved a policy that limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations,repurchase
 agreements  collateralized  by  U.S.  government  and  government  agency  obligations,  and  U.S.  government  and  government  agencymoney
 market  funds. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government  and government  agency obligations, corporatenotes and bonds, and asset and mortgage-backe
d securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA+.Our
 Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances and bank certificates ofdeposit, generally denominate
d in their local currencies.We
 performed  a  sensitivity  analysis  to  determine  the  impact  that  a  100  basis-point  change  in  interest  rates  would  have  on  the  value  of  ourinvestment
 portfolio. At the end of 2015 ,  the incremental change in the fair market value was $27. For those investments that are classified asavailable-for-sale,
 the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equityin accumulated other comprehensive income.
The
 nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of theend of
 2015, the majority of our long-term debt is fixed rate Senior Notes, carried at $5,596. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value ofthe fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financi
al statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.Foreign Currency-Exchange Risk
Our
 foreign  subsidiaries  conduct  certain  transactions  in  their  non-functional  currencies,  which  exposes  us  to  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates.  Wemanage
 these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuationsof foreign exchange on known future expen
ditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily30

Table of ContentsItem 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)(Continued)
to
 economically  hedge  exposure  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventory  expenditures  made  by  our  international  subsidiaries  whose  functionalcurrency is other than
 the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the useof
 these  contracts  and  do  not  intend  to  engage  in  speculative  transactions.  These  contracts  do  not  contain  any  credit-risk-related  contingentfeatures.
While
 we  seek  to  manage  counterparty  risk  associated  with  these  contracts  by  limiting  transactions  to  counterparties  with  which  we  haveestablished
 banking relationships, there can be no assurance that this practice is effective. These contracts are limited to less than one year induration.
 See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair valueof
 unsettled  forward  foreign-exchange  contracts  at  the  end  of 2015 and 2014 .  A  hypothetical  10%  strengthening  of  the  functional  currencycompared
 to  the  non-functional  currency  exchange  rates  at August  30, 2015 would  have  decreased  the  fair  value  of  the  contracts  by  $88  andresulted in an unrealized loss in the co
nsolidated statements of income for the same amount.Commodity Price Risk
We
 are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigatethrough
 fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominately in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced
 contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meetthe
 characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidanceand, thus, require no mark-to-market adjustment.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
 of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  we  performed  an  evaluation  under  the  supervision  and  with  theparticipat
ion of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as definedin
 Rules  13a-15(e)  or  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Act  of  1934  (the  Exchange  Act)).  Based  upon  that  evaluation,  our  ChiefExecutive
 Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls andprocedures are effective.
There has
 been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during ourfiscal
 quarter  ended  August  30,  2015,  that  has  materially  affected  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect  our  internal  control  over  financialreporting.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing a
nd maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) underthe
 Exchange  Act.  Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  and  includes  those  policies  andprocedures
 that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositionsof
 our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements inaccordance
 with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  that  our  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  withappropriate
 authorizations;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use  ordisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financi
al statements.Because
 of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systemsdetermined to be effective can provide only reasona
ble assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.Under the supervision and with the
 participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting asof 
August 30, 2015 ,  using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in InternalControl—Integrated
 Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting waseffective
 as of August  30, 2015 .  The  attestation  of  KPMG  LLP,  our  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm,  on  the  effectiveness  of  ourinternal control over financial reporting is inc

Table of ContentsItem 9B—Other Information
On February 27, 2015, we
 entered into a Co-Branded Credit Card Program Agreement (the “Program Agreement”) with Citibank, N.A. (“Citi”). Underthe
 terms of the Program Agreement, Citi would become the exclusive issuer of our co-branded credit cards to new and existing members of theCompany
 and Visa U.S.A. Inc. would replace American Express as the credit card network for Costco in the United States and Puerto Rico. Ourcurrent
 expectation is that Citi will purchase the current co-branded credit card portfolio from American Express by April 1, 2016 and begin issuingVisa
 cards by the summer of 2016. We would receive various forms of consideration under the Program Agreement. The initial term of the ProgramAgreement is ten years.
The most
 significant expected revenue provided to Costco from Citi under the co-brand credit card program is the percentage or royalty on "externalspend,"
 purchases made with the co-branded card other than from Costco. That percentage will vary based primarily on the amount of externalspend over
 the term of the program. Costco's royalty revenue will also be impacted by the nature and extent of the loyalty rewards to be provided tocardholders
 under the program, primarily by Citi but also partially by Costco under certain circumstances. The amount and character of the loyaltyrewards have yet to be determined and may be adjusted over the term of the program.
The
 next most significant expected benefit to Costco is the reduction in the base discount rate —  the fee Costco is charged for accepting the co-branded credit card. Costco's cost of acceptance of the co-branded credit card wil
l be lower than the cost that Costco bears currently.The loyalty rewards earned by co-branded cardh
olders are expected to be in the form of certificates redeemable at Costco, for cash or merchandise.Based on
 prior experience, Costco expects that most cardholders will redeem the certificates for merchandise, resulting in a benefit to net sales andgross margin on those transactions.
Costco will also receive benefits from
 Citi in the form of a bounty on new credit card accounts Costco sources, assistance in increasing membership,marketing assistance, staff support, and potentially a share of any profits of the program.

BLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders
Costco Wholesale Corporation:
We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of August 30, 2015 andAugust 31,
 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week periods endedAugust
 30,  2015,  August  31,  2014,  and  September  1,  2013.  These  consolidated  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’smanagement. Our responsibility is to express an opinio
n on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standardsrequire that we
 plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.An
 audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includesassessing
 the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statementpresentation. We believe that our audits provide a reaso

Costco Wholesale Corporation:
We
 have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2015, based on criteria established inInternal
 Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). TheCompany’s
 management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectivenessof
 internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reportingincluded in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opin
ion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standardsrequire
 that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  wasmaintained
 in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk thata
 material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Ouraudit
 also  included  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  areasonable basis for our opinion.
A
 company’s  internal  control  over  financial reporting  is a process  designed to  provide  reasonable assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financialreporting
 and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Acompany’s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonab
le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and
 that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of thecompany;
 and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  thecompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because
 of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  anyevaluation
 of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the polici
es or procedures may deteriorate.In
 our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2015, based oncriteria
 established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission(2013).
We
 also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  consolidatedbalance sheets
 of the Company as of August 30, 2015 and August 31, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensiveincome,
 equity, and cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended August 30, 2015, August 31, 2014 and September 1, 2013, and our reportdated October 13, 2015 expressed an unqua
lified opinion on those consolidated financial statements./s/ KPMG LLP

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or
 the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based onthe
 concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandisecategories
 will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At August  30, 2015 ,  Costco operated 686 warehouses worldwide: 480 United States (U.S.) locations (in 
43 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico), 89 Canada locations, 36 Mexico locations, 27 United Kingdom(U.K.)
 locations, 23 Japan locations, 12 Korea locations, 11 Taiwan locations, 7 Australia locations, and 1 Spain location. The Company's onlinebusiness operates websites in the U.S., Canad
a, U.K., and Mexico.Basis of Presentation
The
 consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation,  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  and  subsidiaries  inwhich it
 has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from theCompany’s
 equity.  All  material  inter-company  transactions  between  and  among  the  Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  have  beeneliminated
 in  consolidation.  The  Company’s  net  income  excludes  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests  in  its  operations  in  Taiwan  andKorea. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributa
ble to Costco.Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 
52/53 week fiscal year basis with the fiscal year ending o n the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2015 , 2014, and 
2013 relate to the 52 -week fiscal years ended August 30, 2015 ,  August 31, 2014 , and September 1, 2013 , respectively. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. general
ly accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to makeestimates and assumptio
ns that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dateof
 the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from thoseestimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The
 Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at thedate
 of  purchase,  and  proceeds  due  from  credit  and  debit  card  transactions  with  settlement  terms  of  up  to  one  week.  Credit  and  debit  cardreceivables were $ 
1,243 and $ 1,383 at the end of 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Short-Term Investments
In
 general, short-term investments have a maturity at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond fiveyears
 may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent theinvestment of cash that
 is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using thespecific
 identification  method  with  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  reflected  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  until  realized.Realized
 gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded ininterest income

and
 other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Short-term  investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that theCompany
 has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on arecurring basis.
The
 Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative andquantitative
 criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the credit loss component ininterest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
 Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash andcash
 equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3,and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s inv
estments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.Fair
 value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer  a liability in an orderly transaction  between marketparticipants
 at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observableinputs when measuring fair value. The three leve
ls of inputs are:Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservab
le inputs that are corroborated by marketdata.
Level 3: Significant unobservab
le inputs that are not corroborated by market data.The
 Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such asquoted net asset
 values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all othernon-derivative
 financial  instruments  are  based  on  independent  external  valuation  information.  The  pricing  process  uses  data  from  a  variety  ofindependent
 external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves includingbut not limited to 
treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can bederived
 principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable,using the fair value of the individual sec
urities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.Current
 financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt, which isrecorded on the balance sheet at issuance pric
e and adjusted for any applicable unamortized discounts or premiums.45

Receivables, Net
Receivables consist of the followin
g at the end of 2015 and 2014 :  
2015   2014 Vendor receivables
$ 729  $704 Reinsurance receivables
273  253 Third-party pharmacy receivables
103  87 Other receivables, net
119  104 Receivables, net
$ 1,224  $1,148 Vendor
 receivables include volume rebates or other purchase discounts. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from anyrelated payable due.
 In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor. Reinsurance receivablesare
 held  by  the  Company’s  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary.  The  balance  primarily  represents  amounts  ceded  through  reinsurancearrangements
 and are reflected on a gross basis, separate from the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented on a gross basiswithin
 other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’insurance companies. Other receivables primarily cons
ist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.Receivables
 are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience and application of the specificidentification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial for fiscal years 
2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories consist of the followi
ng at the end of 2015 and 2014 :  
2015   2014 United States
$ 6,427  $5,952 Foreign
2,481  2,504 Merchandise inventories
$ 8,908  $8,456 Merchandise
 inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using thelast-in,
 first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary,for
 the  projected  annual  effect  of  inflation  or  deflation,  and  these  estimates  are  adjusted  to  actual  results  determined  at  year-end,  after  actualinflation
 rates and inventory levels for the year have been determined. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results ofoperations
 by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued bythe retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
Due
 to net deflationary trends, a benefit of $27 was recorded to merchandise costs in both 2015 and 2013 .  Due to net inflationary trends in 2014, acharge
 of $28 was recorded to merchandise costs to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories. At the end of 2015 and 2014 
, the cumulative impact of the LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories w as $ 82 and $ 109 , respectively.The
 Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based onthe Company’s experience. The provisio
n is adjusted periodically to reflect actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second andfourth
 fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progressestowards earning those rebates, provided that they are probab
le and reasonably estimable.46

Property and Equipment
Property and
 equipment are stated at cost. In general, new building additions are classified into components, each with its own estimated useful life,generally 
five to fifty years for buildings and improvements  and three to twenty years  for  equipment  and fixtures.  Depreciation  and amortizationexpense is computed using the straight-line metho
d over estimated useful lives or the lease term, if shorter. Leasehold improvements made after thebeginning
 of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial leaseplus any renewals that are reasonably assure
d at the date the leasehold improvements are made.The
 Company  capitalizes  certain  computer  software  and  software  development  costs  incurred  in  developing  or  obtaining  computer  software  forinternal
 use.  These  costs  are  included  in  equipment  and  fixtures  and  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  thesoftware, generally 
three to seven years. Repair
 and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or changethe
 way  an  asset  functions  or  that  extend  the  useful  life  are  capitalized.  Assets  that  were  removed  during  the  remodel,  refurbishment  orimprovement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 
2015 and 2014 were immaterial. The
 Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes incircumstances
 may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For assetgroups
 held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimatedfuture
 undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In theevent
 that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss would be recognized for the asset group to be held and used equalto
 the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group),the carrying value is
 compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisalsfrom
 third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. Impairment charges, included in selling, general and administrative expenses in theconsolidated statements of income, in 
2015 , 2014 , and 2013 were immaterial. Accounts Payable
The Company’s banking system provides for
 the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Included in accounts payableat the end of 
2015 and 2014 are $ 538 and $ 588 , respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks onwhich the checks were drawn.
Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities
The
 Company  uses  a  combination  of  insurance  and  self-insurance  mechanisms,  including  for  certain  risks  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurancesubsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program,
 to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage,directors’
 and  officers’  liability,  vehicle  liability,  and  employee  health  care  benefits.  Liabilities  associated  with  the  risks  that  are  retained  by  theCompany are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by consid
ering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and otheractuarial
 assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from theseassumptions and historical trends. At the end of 
2015 and 2014 , these insurance liabilities were $ 993 and $ 815 in the aggregate, respectively, andwere included in accrued salari
es and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.The
 Company’s  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  (the  captive)  receives  direct  premiums,  which  are  netted  against  the  Company’spremium
 costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsuranceprogram that includes other

 participants.  The  reinsurance  agreement  is  one  year  in  duration,  and  new  agreements  are  entered  into  by  each  participant  at  theirdiscretion
 at  the  commencement  of  the  next  calendar  year.  The  participant  agreements  and  practices  of  the  reinsurance  program  limit  anyparticipating
 members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidatedbalance
 sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company is notrelieved of its primary obligation to the policyho
lders for activity prior to the termination of the annual agreement.Other Curren

2015 and 2014 :

The
 Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part,through
 the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on knownfuture
 expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreign-currency.  The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventoryexpenditures
 made by the Company’s international subsidiaries, whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. These contracts do not qualify forderivative
 hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculativetransactions.
 These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forwardforeign-exchange
 contracts were $ 889 and $ 585 at the end of 2015 and 2014 ,  respectively. While the Company seeks to manage counterpartyrisk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with w
hich the Company has an established banking relationship, therecan
 be no assurance that this practice is effective. The contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 3 for information on the fairvalue of unsettled forward foreign-exchange co
ntracts at the end of 2015 and 2014 . The
 unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to thenet changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exch
ange contracts was a net gain of $12 for 2015 , and immate rial for 2014 and 2013 . The
 Company  is  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  prices  for  the  energy  it  consumes,  particularly  electricity  and  natural  gas,  which  it  seeks  to  partiallymitigate through the use of
 fixed- and variable-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. TheCompany
 also enters into variable-priced contracts for purchases of fuel for its gas stations. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivativeinstruments,
 but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark-to-market adjustment.
Foreign Currency
The
 functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assetsand liabilities recorded in forei
gn currencies are translated at the48

exchange
 rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Revenues andexpenses of the Company’s consolid
ated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year.The
 Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominatedin currencies other than the functional currency in interest income an
d other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Generally,this
 includes the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries to their functional currency. Alsoincluded
 are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items resulted in net gains of$35 
, $25 , and $37 for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Revenue Recognition
The
 Company generally recognizes sales, which include shipping fees where applicable, net of returns, at the time the member takes possession ofmerchandise
 or receives services. When the Company collects payments from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or theperformance
 of  services,  the  amounts  received  are  generally  recorded  as  deferred  sales,  included  in  other  current  liabilities  in  the  consolidatedbalance sheets,
 until the sale or service is completed. The Company reserves for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandisereturns
 and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the net realizable value ofmerchandise inventories to be returned. Amounts collecte
d from members for sales or value added taxes are recorded on a net basis.The
 Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned.Generally,
 when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, can influenceproduct
 or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not theprimary obligor and does not
 possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, it records the net amounts earned, which is reflected in netsales. The Company records related shippin
g fees on a gross basis.The
 Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  revenue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  over  the  one-year  membership  period.  TheCompany's
 Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of approximately $ 750 per year), whichcan
 be  redeemed  only  at  Costco  warehouses.  The  Company  accounts  for  this  reward  as  a  reduction  in  sales.  The  sales  reduction  andcorresponding
 liability (classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets) are computed after giving effect to the estimatedimpact
 of non-redemptions based on historical data. The net reduction in sales was $ 1,128 ,  $ 1,051 ,  and $ 970 in 2015 , 2014 ,  and 2013 , respectively.
Merchandise Costs
Merchandise
 costs consist of the purchase price of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company’sdepot
 operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also includesalaries, benefits, depreciation, and utiliti
es on production equipment in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments.Vendor Consideration
The
 Company  has  agreements  with  vendors  to  receive  funds  for  volume  rebates,  certain  ongoing  programs,  and  other  vendor  consideration.Volume
 rebates or other purchase discounts are evidenced by signed agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory whenearned
 or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise issold. Other vendor consideration is generally record
ed as a reduction of merchandise costs49

upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approac
h.Selling, General and Ad
ministrative ExpensesSelling,
 general  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries,  benefits  and  workers’  compensation  costs  for  warehouse  employees,other
 than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses, as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel.Selling,
 general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, bank charges, utilities, and stock-based compensation expense as w
ell as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse operations.Retirement Plans
The
 Company's 401(k) Retirement Plan is available to all U.S. employees who have completed 90  days of  employment. The plan allows pre-taxdeferrals, a portion of
 which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution.The
 Company  also  has  a  defined  contribution  plan  for  Canadian  employees  and  contributes  a  percentage  of  each  employee's  salary.  Certainsubsidiaries
 in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans that are not material. Amountsexpensed
 under  all  plans  were $454 , $436 ,  and $409 for 2015 , 2014 ,  and 2013 ,  respectively,  and  are  included  in  selling,  general  andadministrative expenses and merchandis
e costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.Stock-Based Compensation
Restricted
 stock units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based
 awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. The Company does notreduce
 stock-based  compensation  for  an  estimate  of  forfeitures,  which  are  inconsequential  in  light  of  historical  experience  and  considering  theawards vest on a quarterly basis. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
Compensation
 expense for all stock-based awards granted is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite serviceperiod
 for the entire award. The terms of the Company’s stock-based awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for acceleratedvesting
 of a portion of outstanding shares based on reaching certain cumulative years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for theaccelerated
 shares is recognized upon achievement of the long service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any pointin
 time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as themarket value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected divid
ends forgone during the vesting period.Stock-based
 compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements ofincome. See Note 7 for additional information on the C
ompany’s stock-based compensation plans.Leases
The
 Company  leases  land  and/or  buildings  at  warehouses  and  certain  other  office  and  distribution  facilities,  primarily  under  operating  leases.Operating
 leases expire at various dates through 2064 ,  with the exception of one lease in the Company’s U.K. subsidiary, which expires in 2151 . These
 leases  generally  contain  one  or  more  of  the  following  options,  which  the  Company  can  exercise  at  the  end  of  the  initial  lease  term:(a)
 renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase ofthe property at the then-fair market value; or (c) right of first refusal in the event of a third-party purchase offer.

The
 Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of thelease and
 any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise, from the date the Company has control of the property.Certain leases provide for periodic rental incre
ases based on price indices, or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume.The Company
 has capital leases for certain warehouse locations, expiring at various dates through 2040 . Capital lease assets  are included in land,buildings,
 and  improvements  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Amortization  expense  on  capital  lease  assets  is  recorded  asdepreciation
 expense  and  is  predominately  included  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses.  Capital  lease liabilities  are  recorded  at  thelesser
 of the estimated fair market value of the leased property or the net present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments and areincluded
 in other  current  liabilities  and deferred  income  taxes  and other  liabilities  in the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets.  Interest  onthese obligations is includ
ed in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.The Company
 records an asset and related financing obligation for the estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements where itis
 considered  the  owner  for  accounting  purposes,  to  the  extent  the  Company  is  involved  in  the  construction  of  the  building  or  structuralimprovements
 or has construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy, the Company assesses whether these arrangementsqualify
 for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the Company continues to be the deemed owner, it accounts for thearrangement as a financing lease.
The
 Company’s asset retirement obligations (ARO) are primarily related to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed inorder
 to comply with the lease agreement. These obligations are recorded as a liability with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease termbased
 upon the estimated fair value of the costs to remove the leasehold improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projectedfuture
 value  of  the  obligation  using  the  Company’s  incremental  borrowing  rate.  The  ARO  assets  are  depreciated  using  the  same  depreciationmethod
 as the respective leasehold improvement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associatedwith
 these leases amounted to $ 54 and $ 55 at the end of 2015 and 2014 ,  respectively, and are included in deferred income taxes and otherliabilities in the acco
mpanying consolidated balance sheets.Preopening Expenses
Preopening expenses relate
d to new warehouses, new regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred.Income Taxes
The
 Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future taxconsequences
 attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective taxbases
 and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxableincome
 in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxassets
 and  liabilities  of  a  change  in  tax  rates  is  recognized  in  income  in  the  period  that  includes  the  enactment  date.  A  valuation  allowance  isestablished when necessary to reduce d
eferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.The
 determination  of  the  Company’s  provision  for  income  taxes  requires  significant  judgment,  the  use  of  estimates,  and  the  interpretation  andapplication
 of  complex  tax  laws.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  the  timing  and  amounts  of  deductible  and  taxable  items  and  theprobability
 of  sustaining  uncertain  tax  positions.  The  benefits  of  uncertain  tax  positions  are  recorded  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  financialstatements
 only  after  determining  a  more-likely-than-not  probability  that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will  withstand  challenge,  if  any,  from  taxauthorities.
 Additionally, certain of our cumulative foreign undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. These earnings would besubject to U.S. income tax if we

n and could result in a U.S. tax liability. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities andrecords any changes in the consolidate
d financial statements as appropriate. See Note 8 for additional information.Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco
The
 computation  of  basic  net  income  per  share  uses  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  that  were  outstanding  during  the  period.  Thecomputation
 of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus thenumber
 of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stockmethod for shares subject to RSUs and the “if converted” method for the convertible note securities.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Repurchased
 shares of common stock are retired,  in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchasedshares
 is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par is deducted by allocation to both additional paid-in capital andretained
 earnings.  The  amount  allocated  to  additional  paid-in  capital  is  calculated  as  the  current  value  of  additional  paid-in  capital  per  shareoutstanding
 and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additionalinformation.
Recent Accounting Pronounceme
nts Not Yet AdoptedIn
 April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changed the criteria for reporting discontinued operations, aswell
 as requiring new disclosures regarding discontinued operations and disposals that do not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. Thisguidance
 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted for disposals that have not been reported infinancial
 statements previously issued. The Company will adopt this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2016. Adoption is not expected to havea material impact on the Company’s consolidate
d financial statements or disclosures.In
 May  2014,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  on  the  recognition  of  revenue  from  contracts  with  customers.  The  guidance  converges  therequirements
 for reporting revenue in addition to requiring disclosures sufficient to describe the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenueand
 cash flows arising from these contracts. Companies can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment asof the date of
 adoption. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. TheCompany plans to
 adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standardon its consolidated financial statements an
d disclosures.52

Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The
 Company  grants  stock-based  compensation  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  Stock  option  awards  were  granted  until  the  fourthquarter
 of fiscal 2006, when the Company began awarding RSUs. Beginning in 2009, RSU grants to all executive officers have been performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implem
ented by the Company.RSUs
 held  by  employees  and  non-employee  directors  are  subject  to  quarterly  vesting  upon  certain  terminations  of  employment  or  service.Employees
 who attain certain years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting daterather
 than upon retirement. The Seventh Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Seventh Plan), amended in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, is theCompany’s only
 stock-based compensation plan with shares available for grant at the end of 2015 . Each share  issued in respect of stock awards iscounted as 
1.75 shares toward  the limit of shares made available under the Seventh Plan. The Seventh Plan authorized the issuance of 23,500,000 shares
 ( 13,429,000 RSUs)  of common stock for future grants in addition to the shares authorized under the previous plan. The Company issuesnew
 shares  of  common  stock  upon  exercise  of  stock  options  and  upon  vesting  of  RSUs.  Shares  for  vested  RSUs  are  generally  delivered  toparticipants annually, net of shares equal to the minimum statutory withho
lding taxes.As
 required by the Company's Seventh Plan, in conjunction with the special cash dividend discussed in Note 6, adjustments were made to awardsoutstanding
 on the dividend record date to preserve their value following the dividend, as follows: (i) the number of shares subject to outstandingRSUs
 was increased; and (ii) the exercise prices of outstanding stock options were reduced and the number of shares subject to such options wasincreased. Approximately 
410,000 stock options were adjusted, and approximately 8,956,000 RSUs were adjusted. These adjustments did n ot resultin
 additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the outstanding awards did not change. As further required by the SeventhPlan,
 the maximum number of shares issuable under the Seventh Plan was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional 750,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
RSUs
 granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five years and three years,  respectively. Additionally, the terms ofthe RSUs, including performance-based a
wards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 ormore
 years and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively, and provide for vesting upon certain terminations of employment orservice. Recipients are not
 entitled to vote or receive dividends on non-vested and undelivered shares. At the end of 2015 , 18,308,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs un
der the Seventh Plan.The following awards were outstand
ing at the end of 2015 : •
8,698,000 time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employme nt over specified periods of time;•
535,000 performance-based  RSUs,  of  which 281,000 were  granted  to  executive  officers  subject  to  the  certification  of  the  attainment  ofspecified
 performance targets for 2015 .  This certification occurred in September 2015, at which time a portion vested as a result of the longservice of all executive officers. The awards vest upon continue
d employment over specified periods of time.58

Note 8—Income Taxes (Continued)
The
 deferred  tax  accounts  at  the  end of 2015 and 2014 include  current  deferred  income tax assets  of $521 and $448 respectively,  included indeferred
 income taxes and other current assets; non-current deferred income tax assets of $109 and $68 , respectively, included in other assets;and
 non-current deferred income tax liabilities of $462 and $429 ,  respectively, included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities. Included innon-current deferred tax assets for 2015 are 
$33 of foreign tax credits which expire in 2025.The
 Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries becauseits
 subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings if repatriated would not result in a deferred taxliability.
 This includes the remaining undistributed earnings of the Canadian operations that the Company maintains are indefinitely reinvested, orcould
 be repatriated without resulting in a deferred tax liability. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of foreign operations when it is determinedthat such earnings are no longer indefin
itely reinvested.During
 2015, the Company repatriated a portion of the earnings in the Canadian operations that, in 2014, the Company determined were no longerconsidered
 indefinitely  reinvested.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  the  Company  changed  its  position  regarding  an  additional  portion  of  theundistributed
 earnings  of  the  Canadian operations,  which are  no longer  considered  indefinitely  reinvested.  Current  exchange  rates  compared  tohistorical rates when these earnings were ge
nerated resulted in an immaterial U.S. benefit, which was recorded at the end of 2015.The
 Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $2,845 and $3,619 at  the end of 2015 and 2014 , respectively,
 of  certain  non-U.S.  consolidated  subsidiaries  as  such  earnings  are  deemed  by  the  Company  to  be  indefinitely  reinvested  or  theearnings
 if  repatriated  would  not  result  in  a  deferred  tax  liability.  Because  of  the  availability  of  U.S.  foreign  tax  credits  and  complexity  of  thecomputatio
n, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability that would be associated with such earnings if such earnings werenot
 deemed  to  be  indefinitely  reinvested.  The  Company  believes  that  its  U.S.  current  and  projected  asset  position  is  sufficient  to  meet  its  U.S.liquidity
 requirements and has no current plans to repatriate for use in the U.S. the cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held bythese non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earn
ings are considered indefinitely reinvested.A reconciliation of the beginni
ng and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2015 and 2014 is as follows:  
2015   2014 Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginnin
g of year$ 75  $80 Gross increases—current year tax positions
26  9 Gross increases—tax positions in prior years

(2 ) (2 )Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year
$ 158  $75 Included
 in the balance at the end of 2015 and 2014 ,  are $50 and $38 , respectively, of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highlycertain
 but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interestand
 penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to thetaxing authority
 to an earlier period. The Company has recorded an offsetting long-term asset of $48 for amounts included in the balance at the endof 2015.  Offsetting long-term assets were not material at the end of 2014. 
The
 total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $98 and 
$47 at the end of 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 61

Accrued
 interest  and  penalties  related  to  income  tax  matters  are  classified  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense.  Interest  and  penaltiesrecognized by the Company were not material in 
2015 and 2014 . Accrued interest and penalties were not material at the end of 2015 and 2014 . The
 Company  is  currently  under  audit  by  several  taxing  jurisdictions  in  the  United  States  and  in  several  foreign  countries.  Some  audits  mayconclude
 in the  next  12 months  and the unrecognized  tax  benefits  we have recorded  in relation  to  the  audits may  differ  from  actual  settlementamounts.
 It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertaintax positions in connection with the audits. The
 Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount ofunrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.
The
 Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada and in several other foreign jurisdictions.With
 few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2007. The Company iscurrently
 subject to examination in Canada for fiscal years 2011 to present and in California for fiscal years 2007 to present. No other examinationsare believed to be material.

Legal Proceedings
The
 Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance withapplicable
 accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where theypresent loss continge
ncies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. TheCompany
 monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnificationarrangements
 concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date ofthis
 report,  the  Company  has  not  recorded  an  accrual  with  respect  to  any  matter  described  below.  If  the  loss  contingency  at  issue  is  not  bothprobable
 and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that willmake
 the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred,including
 a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (includingany loss in
 excess of the accrual) cannot in our view be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought areindeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the

 Wyatt,  et al., v. B. P. America Corp., et al., Case No. 07-1754 (S.D. Cal.). On June 18, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict  Litigationassigned
 the action, entitled In re Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Practices Litigation, MDL Docket No 1840, to Judge Kathryn Vratil in the UnitedStates
 District Court for the District of Kansas. On April 12, 2009, the Company agreed to settle the actions in which it is named as a defendant.Under the settlement, which
 was subject to final approval by the court, the Company agreed, to the extent allowed by law and subject to other termsand conditions in the agreement, to
 install over five years from the effective date of the settlement temperature-correcting dispensers in the States ofAlabama,
 Arizona,  California,  Florida,  Georgia,  Kentucky,  Nevada,  New  Mexico,  North  Carolina,  South  Carolina,  Tennessee,  Texas,  Utah,  andVirginia.
 Other than payments to class representatives, the settlement does not provide for cash payments to class members. On September 22,2011,
 the  court  preliminarily  approved  a  revised  settlement,  which  did  not  materially  alter  the  terms.  On  April  24,  2012,  the  court  granted  finalapproval
 of the revised settlement. A class member who objected has filed a notice of appeal from the order approving the settlement. Plaintiffshave moved for an award of 
$10 in attorneys’ fees, as well as an award of costs and payments to class representatives. The Company has opposedthe
 motion. On March 20, 2014, the Company filed a notice invoking a “most favored nation” provision under the settlement, under which it seeks toadopt
 provisions in later settlements with certain other defendants, an invocation that class counsel opposed. The motion was denied on January23, 2015. Final judgment was entered on S
eptember 22, 2015, and the Company intends to appeal.The Company
 has received notices from most states stating that they have appointed an agent to conduct an examination of the books and recordsof
 the Company to determine whether it has complied with state unclaimed property laws. In addition to seeking the turnover of unclaimed propertysubject
 to escheat laws, the states may seek interest, penalties, costs of examinations, and other relief. Certain states have separately also maderequests for payment by the Company concerning a specific type of property, some of which have b
een paid in immaterial amounts.The
 Company  has  received  from  the  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  subpoenas  and  administrative  inspection  warrants  concerning  theCompany'
s fulfillment of prescriptions related to controlled substances and related practices. Offices of the United States Attorney in various districtshave
 communicated  to  the  Company  their  belief  that  the  Company  has  committed  civil  regulatory  violations  concerning  these  subjects.  TheCompany is seeking to cooperate with these process

 Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effecton the
 Company’s financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could resultin a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal q
uarter.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The
 Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan,Australia,
 and  Spain  and  through  majority-owned  subsidiaries  in  Taiwan  and  Korea.  The  Company’s  reportable  segments  are  largely  based  onmanagement’s
 organization  of  the  operating  segments  for  operational  decisions  and  assessments  of  financial  performance,  which  considersgeographic
 locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are the same as described in Note 1. All material inter-segment net salesand
 expenses  have  been  eliminated  in  computing  total  revenue  and  operating  income.  Certain  operating  expenses,  predominantly  stock-basedcompensation,
 are  incurred  on  behalf  of  the  Company's  Canadian  and  Other  International  operations,  but  are  included  in  the  U.S.  operationsbecause those costs are not allocated internal
ly and generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team.

 that  remain  outstanding  as  of  the  Termination  Date  shall  be  treated  in  a  manner  consistent  with  Section  2(b)(v)  of  thisAgreement.

4.Conditions on Certain Payments or Benefits . (a)
General Release of Claims .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in consideration of Executive’s receipt ofthe
 payments and benefits described under Section 2(b) or Section 3(a), as applicable, Executive agrees that, as a condition to hisreceipt
 of  any  such  payments  and  benefits,  he  shall  timely  execute  (and  not  revoke  thereafter)  a  general  release  of  claims  (a“Release”),
 in a form to be provided by the Company, releasing any and all claims of any kind arising from his employment or thetermination
 of his employment with the Company. To be timely, the Release must become effective and irrevocable no later thanfifty-five
 (55) days following the date of Executive’s termination (the “Release Deadline”). If the Release does not become effectiveand
 irrevocable  by  the  Release  Deadline,  Executive  will  forfeit  any  rights  to  the  payments  and  benefits  under  Section  2(b)  orSection 3(a), as applicable.
(b)
Clawback Policies .  All amounts payable under this Agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Company’s “clawback” policiesas in effect from time to time.
5.
Accrued Obligations .  To the extent not modified by this Agreement, Executive shall receive any amounts and benefits earned, accrued, orowing
 but not yet paid to him as of the Termination Date in accordance with the terms of any applicable employee benefit plans, programs,policies and arrangements of the Company.
6.
Tax Matters . (a)
Withholding of Taxes .  The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or othertaxes as the Company determines it is required to withhold pursu
ant to any applicable law.(b)
Parachute Excise Tax .  In the event that any amounts payable under this Agreement or otherwise to Executive would (i) constitute“parachute
 payments” within the meaning of section 280G of the Code or any comparable successor provisions and (ii) but for thissubsection
 would be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the Code or any comparable successor provisions (the“Excise Tax”), then such amounts payable to Executive hereund
er shall be either:(i)
provided to Executive in full; or(ii)
provided to Executive to the maximum extent that would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the ExciseTax;
whichev
er of the foregoing amounts, when taking into account applicable federal, state, local and foreign income and employment taxes, the ExciseTax and any other applicable taxes, results
 in the receipt by Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding thatall
 or  some  portion  of  such  benefits  may  be  subject  to  the  Excise  Tax.  Unless  the  Company  and  Executive  otherwise  agree  in  writing,  anydetermination
 required  under  this  subsection  shall  be  made  in  writing  in  good  faith  by  a  nationally  recognized  accounting  firm  selected  by  theCompany
 (the  “Accountants”).  In  the  event  of  a  reduction  in  benefits  hereunder,  the  reduction  of  the  total  payments  shall  apply  as  follows,notwithstanding
 anything  to  the  contrary  in  Section  12.9  of  the  Company’s  Seventh  Restated  2002  Incentive  Plan,  as  amended:  (i)  any  cashseverance
 payment due under this Agreement shall be reduced; (ii) forfeiture of any acceleration of vesting of any equity-based awards subject tosection
 409A of the Code, with the tranche that would vest last (without any such acceleration) first being subject to forfeiture; (iii) any accelerationof
 vesting of any equity-based awards not subject to section 409A of the Code shall remain as originally scheduled to vest, with the tranche thatwould vest last (without any such acceleration) first remaini
ng as originally scheduled to vest, and (iv) reduction of all other payments and benefits ina
 manner and order of priority that provides Executive with the largest net after-tax value; provided that such other payments and benefits of equalafter-tax
 present value shall be reduced in the reverse order of payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any reductionunder
 this subsection shall be structured in a manner intended to comply with section 409A of the Code. For purposes of making the calculationsrequired
 by this subsection, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely onreasonab
le, good-faith interpretations concerning the application of the Code and other applicable legal authority. The Company and Executive shallfurnish to
 the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under thissubsection.
 The Company shall bear all costs that the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by thissubsection.

If,  notwithstanding  any  reduction  described  in  this  subsection,  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (“IRS”)  determines  that  Executive  is  liable  for  theExcise
 Tax as a result of the receipt of amounts payable under this Agreement or otherwise as described above, then Executive shall be obligatedto
 pay  back  to  the  Company,  within  thirty  (30)  days  after  a  final  IRS  determination  or,  in  the  event  that  Executive  challenges  the  final  IRSdetermination,
 a final judicial determination, a portion of such amounts equal to the Repayment Amount. The “Repayment Amount” with respect tothe
 payment  of  benefits  shall  be  the  smallest  such  amount,  if  any,  that  is  required  to  be  paid  to  the  Company  so  that  Executive’s  net  after-taxproceeds with respect to any
 payment of benefits (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax and all other applicable taxes imposed onsuch
 payment) are maximized. The Repayment Amount with respect to the payment of benefits shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more thanzero
 would not result in Executive’s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the payment of such benefits being maximized. If the Excise Tax is noteliminated pursuant to this paragraph, Executive sh
all pay the Excise Tax.Notwithstanding
 any other provision of this subsection, if (i) there is a reduction in the payment of benefits as described in this subsection, (ii) theIRS
 later determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment of which would result in the maximization of Executive’s net after-taxproceeds
 (calculated as if Executive’s benefits had not previously been reduced), and (iii) Executive pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shallpay
 to Executive the amount by which those benefits which were reduced pursuant to this subsection as soon as administratively possible afterExecutive
 pays the Excise Tax; provided that, to the extent required by section 409A of the Code, the reimbursement is made on or before the lastday
 of Executive’s taxable year following the taxable year in which the Excise Tax was paid; the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidationor
 exchange for another benefit; and the amount subject to reimbursement in one year shall not affect any other amounts eligible for reimbursementin any other year.

 or  other  agreement  between  Executive  and  the  Company  that  relate  to  any  matter  that  is  also  the  subject  of  thisAgreement, and such provisions in such other agreeme
nts will be null and void.(c)

Interpretation .  Notwithstanding the other provisions hereof, this Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of section409A
 of the Code, to the extent applicable, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to avoid any penalty sanctions under section409A
 of the Code. Accordingly, all provisions herein, or incorporated by reference, shall be construed and interpreted to complywith
 section 409A of the Code and, if necessary, any such provision shall be deemed amended to comply with section 409A of theCode
 and the regulations thereunder. If any payment or benefit cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein withoutincurring
 sanctions  under  section  409A  of  the  Code,  then  such  benefit  or  payment  shall  be  provided  in  full  at  the  earliest  timethereafter
 when  such  sanctions  will  not  be  imposed.  Any  amount  payable  under  this  Agreement  that  constitutes  deferredcompensation
 subject to section 409A of the Code shall be paid at the time provided under this Agreement or such other time aspermitted
 under  section  409A  of  the  Code.  No  interest  will  be  payable  with  respect  to  any  amount  paid  within  a  time  periodpermitted
 by, or delayed because of, section 409A of the Code. All payments to be made upon the Termination Date under thisAgreement
 that  are  deferred  compensation  subject  to  section  409A  of  the  Code  may  only  be  made  upon  a  “separation  fromservice”

 payable to Executive during the six (6) month period following the Termination Date does not qualify within either of theforegoing
 exceptions and constitutes deferred compensation subject to the requirements of section 409A of the Code, then suchamount
 shall  hereinafter  be  referred  to  as  the  “Excess  Amount.”  If  at  the  time  of  Executive’s  separation  from  service,  theCompany’s
 (or any entity required to be aggregated with the Company under section 409A of the Code) stock is publicly-traded onan
 established securities market or otherwise and Executive is a “specified employee” (as defined in section 409A of the Code anddetermined
 in the sole discretion of the Company (or any successor thereto) in accordance with the Company’s (or any successorthereto)
 “specified employee” determination policy), then the Company shall postpone the commencement of the payment of theportion
 of the Excess Amount that is payable within the six (6) month period following the Termination Date with the Company (orany successor thereto) for
 six (6) months following the Termination Date with the Company (or any successor thereto). The delayedExcess
 Amount shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive within ten (10) days following the date that is six (6) months following theTermination
 Date with the Company (or any successor thereto). If Executive dies during such six (6) month period and prior to thepayment
 of the portion of the Excess Amount that is required to be delayed on account of section 409A of the Code, such ExcessAmount
 shall  be  paid  to  the  personal  representative  of  Executive’s  estate  within  sixty  (60)  days  after  Executive’s  death.  TheCompany makes
 no representation that any or all of the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement will be exempt fromor
