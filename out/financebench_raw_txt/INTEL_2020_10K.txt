A Year in Review
We achieved record revenue of $77.9 billion, with 49% from our data-centric 
businesses, amid the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dynamic of work and 
learn from home resulted in strong demand for notebook PCs, while demand for 
desktop PCs weakened. Demand in the DCG cloud service providers market 
segment grew, while enterprise and government declined on macroeconomic 
weakness. We shipped a higher volume of 10nm products than we had anticipated 
at the beginning of the year. The increased mix of 10nm, combined with a higher 
portion of revenue from lower margin adjacent businesses, offset higher platform 
revenue and drove a decline in gross margin of 3 percentage points. We invested 
$13.6 billion in R&D, reduced our spending to 25.3% of revenue, and signed an 
agreement to divest our NAND memory business. We made capital investments of 
$14.3 billion, and generated $35.4 billion cash from operations and $21.1 billion of 
free cash flow. We also returned $19.8 billion to stockholders, including $5.6 billion 
in dividends and $14.2 billion in buybacks.
"We achieved record revenue for the fifth consecutive 
year and maintained a strong balance sheet and 
liquidity position. Our results amid the challenges of a 
global pandemic and an uncertain economy reflect the 
importance of our technology and the resilience of our 
employees around the world."

Fundamentals of Our Business 5
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to play a larger role in our customers' success by delivering a predictable cadence of leadership products. 
The world is changing and driving the need for exponentially more computing. First we experienced the PC era, followed by the mobile 
and cloud era. We are now entering the era of distributed intelligence, where computing is pervasive and so many things in our lives—our 
homes, our cars, our hospitals, and our cities—now function like computers. In this world of distributed intelligence, our three fastest 
growing opportunities are AI, 5G network transformation, and the intelligent and autonomous edge. 
We have a history of transforming to capitalize on market shifts, and we are in the midst of another significant transformation to position 
ourselves and our customers for growth. With our focus on execution and re-energized culture as a force multiplier, we are transforming 
from a CPU to a multi-architecture xPU company, from silicon to platforms, and from a traditional IDM to a new, modern IDM. Our priorities 
are to strengthen our core, extend our reach, and redefine our position in the industry. Our capital provides a foundation to invest in our 
growth and to supplement and strengthen our capabilities. We are thoughtfully deploying capital and focusing our investment in 
differentiated technologies where we can play a bigger role in the success of our customers and deliver attractive returns to our 
stockholders. 
Our Priorities
Improve Execution to Strengthen Our Core
We have made changes that help position us to sharpen our operational excellence and process technology. We have streamlined our 
product roadmaps, evolved our technical organization to drive greater transparency and accountability, and exited businesses to enable 
focus on our core strategy. 
Technical talent. Our leadership team has deep technical, engineering, and business expertise and is focused on our opportunities. We 
are re-energizing our culture to drive better business outcomes for our customers by instilling a growth mindset, increasing accountability 
around shared company goals, implementing new operational protocols, and renewing a sense of purpose and value to create an 
environment for innovation and growth.
Continuous innovation . To deliver leadership products, we continue to innovate across all of the areas that are key to product leadership: 
process and packaging, architecture, memory, interconnect, security, and software. With these six areas, we are creating innovative xPU 
platforms that uniquely serve diverse new workload opportunities, and transforming from silicon to platforms to solve customers' problems 
through complete solutions offerings.
Predictable cadence. We have made an architectural shift to die disaggregation that, when combined with our differentiated advanced 
packaging, creates flexibility to use the process that best serves our customers and supports our ability to deliver on a predictable 
cadence. Disaggregated design allows us to manufacture different components of a chip on different processes: some components can 
benefit from the greater performance of the latest process node, while others can leverage lower-cost nodes where differentiated 
performance is not needed. Through disaggregated design, we mix and match architectures, IP, process nodes, and silicon from our own 
manufacturing facilities or from external foundries. Table of Contents
Fundamentals of Our Business 6
New, modern IDM. We are investing to transform our traditional IDM model to adapt to an evolving industry. This means creating greater 
flexibility to use internal or external foundry processes. It requires that we continue to lead advances in silicon technology by leaning into 
our expertise and manufacturing scale, while evolving to engage with the ecosystem in new and different ways. It also requires that we 
leverage our disaggregated design capabilities and continue to manufacture new products with significant cost advantage. We will also 
continue to invest in process technology development to bring to market the future process nodes and advanced packaging capabilities 
that create product differentiation and customization, while also enabling manufacturing optionality.
Evolving our engagement with the broader silicon manufacturing and design ecosystem involves working as a strategic partner with 
equipment vendors, EDA providers, and third-party foundries to help enhance the performance of our manufacturing tools, optimize 
design software for our processes, simplify design, improve efficiency, and standardize components. This also involves increasing the 
strategic use of third-party IP for standardized components to allow us to focus on differentiating technology, and updating our design 
methodologies to support movement of our designs to and from external foundries. 
Extend Our Reach to Accelerate Our Growth
Diverse product portfolio to capitalize on the fastest growing opportunities. The proliferation of data analytics, edge computing, and AI is 
driving a diverse and expanding range of computing applications from edge to cloud. In response, we are innovating to deliver products 
including a mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, and FPGAs—unified by an 
open, industry-standard programming model, oneAPI, to simplify application development.
AI helps our customers make sense of data to unleash its potential. We offer a combination of hardware and software technologies that 
deliver broad capabilities to support computing, storage, transmission, and tuning in AI. We have taken a multi-architecture approach to AI 
hardware. Intel Xeon processors provide a foundation for analytics and AI, and software like the OpenVINOTM toolkit significantly simplifies 
the deployment of solutions. Intel® FPGAs allow customers to access leading AI inferencing performance for their models. Similarly, Intel® 
MovidiusTM MyriadTM VPUs are purpose-built for AI and support diverse approaches for innovation in a wide range of applications, from 
healthcare to autonomous driving to facial recognition. Habana's Gaudi* AI training Processor and Goya* AI Inference Processor offer an 
easy-to-program development environment to help customers deploy and differentiate their solutions as AI workloads continue to evolve 
with growing demands on computing, memory, and connectivity. 
The transition to 5G and the cloudification1 of the network present a significant opportunity. 5G connectivity will transform industries from 
all business sectors and it continues to be a strategic priority across Intel. We are collaborating with ecosystem and vertical industry 
partners to define, prototype, test, and deliver 5G standards and solutions. Our 5G efforts are focused on network infrastructure and other 
data-centric opportunities, and our team has developed a valuable IP portfolio of products designed to support 5G network infrastructure, 
including the Intel Atom P5900 processor, a next-generation structured ASIC for 5G network acceleration, the new 2nd Gen Intel Xeon 
Scalable processors, and the Intel® Ethernet 700 Series Network Adapter.
Moving compute to the edge, where data is generated and consumed, provides new insight and revenue from previously untapped data. 
Our portfolio of products and capabilities positions us well to play a larger role in our customers' success. We are investing in processors 
with features made for edge workloads. We announced new enhanced Internet of Things capabilities, including 11th Gen Intel Core 
processors, Intel Atom x6000E series processors, Pentium® processors, and Celeron® N and J series processors, bringing new AI, 
security, functional safety, and real-time capabilities to edge customers. This year, we announced Mobileye* SupervisionTM, the EyeQ5*-
based solution that incorporates an end-to-end engine control unit, surround-view camera array, processors, driving policy, and high-
definition maps—all derived directly from our ongoing autonomous vehicle program. 
Redefine Our Position in the Industry
Solve our customers' problems through solutions and platforms. We are expanding beyond the CPU to better solve our customers' 
problems, and not just deliver parts of the solution. With our xPU portfolio, platform vision, IDM capabilities, and scale, we are able to help 
our customers tackle their own opportunities. We announced the Intel Evo platform brand powered by 11th Gen Intel Core processors with 
Intel Iris Xe graphics, representing laptop designs supported by Intel's Project Athena innovation program. In addition, we acquired Moovit 
to accelerate Mobileye's transformation to a full-stack MaaS provider that can provide hardware, software, sensors, integration, and large-
scale services. We are actively evaluating opportunities in software, services, and solutions, in AI, network transformation, and intelligent 
edge.

Our Financial Capital Allocation Decisions Are Driven by Three Priorities
Invest in the Business Acquire and Integrate Return Cash to Stockholders
Our first allocation priority is to invest in 
R&D and capital spending to strengthen 
our competitive position. We are efficiently 
maintaining our R&D investment as a 
percentage of revenue and continue to 
make significant capital investments, 
increasing our 14nm and 10nm wafer 
capacity. We also invested in 7nm and 
future process development. In addition to 
our own manufacturing capacity, we 
continue to use third-party foundries to 
expand the ways we can support our 
customers.Our second allocation priority is to invest in 
companies around the world that will 
complement our strategic objectives and 
stimulate growth of data-centric 
opportunities. We look for acquisitions that 
leverage and strengthen our capital and 
R&D investments. In 2020, we completed 
various acquisitions to expand our product 
offerings and the markets we serve. Those 
acquisitions included Moovit, which 
accelerates our MaaS offering and brings 
Mobileye closer to achieving our plan to 
become a complete mobility provider, 
including robotaxi services. We take action 
when investments do not meet our criteria, 
and in 2020 we divested the majority of our 
Home Gateway Platform division and 
signed an agreement to divest our NAND 
memory business.Our third allocation priority is to return cash 
to stockholders. We achieve this through our 
dividend and share repurchase programs. In 
March, we suspended stock repurchases in 
light of the COVID-19 pandemic and in 
August we entered into $10.0 billion in ASR 
agreements in response to our belief that our 
stock was trading below its intrinsic valuation 
at that time. In Q1 2021, we intend to 
complete the remaining $2.4 billion of our 
$20.0 billion planned repurchases 
announced in October 2019. During 2020, 
we paid $5.6 billion in dividends and 
repurchased $14.2 billion in shares. Our 
approach has reduced diluted shares 
outstanding over time.

 Fundamentals of Our Business Our Capital 9
Intellectual Capital
Research and Development
R&D investment is critical for enabling us to deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products and extend our reach to accelerate our 
growth. Successful R&D efforts can lead to new products and technologies or improvements to existing ones, which we seek to protect 
through our IP rights. We may augment our R&D initiatives by acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&D agreements, and 
directly purchasing or licensing technology.
Areas Key to Product Leadership
Every year we make significant investments in R&D and we have intensified our focus on areas key to product leadership. Our objective is 
to improve user experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other 
features with each new generation of products. We are also focused on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing 
ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency, including a significant reduction of design rules for future process nodes.
Process and packaging.  We are creating a new wave of compute engines 
that mix and match different process technologies and then connect them 
with high-performance, low-power packaging technologies like EMIB1 and 
Foveros1, the industry's first implementation of stacked processing 
components. This disaggregated design approach allows us to 
manufacture different components of a chip on different processes, giving 
us the flexibility to use the process that best serves our customers.
▪We launched our Intel Core processors with Intel® Hybrid 
Technology, also referred to as Lakefield, which use Foveros 3D 
stacking technology to achieve a dramatic reduction in package 
area.
▪We introduced our 10nm SuperFin Technology, a redefinition of 
the FinFET with new SuperMIM capacitors. It enables the largest 
single intranode enhancement in our history. We are planning 
further 10nm intranode enhancements.
xPU architecture.  The future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, 
and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, accelerator, and FPGA
sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building 
processors that span four major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing: 
▪CPU.  We started shipping our 11th Gen Intel Core processors, with our next-generation Willow Cove CPU microarchitecture, 
which includes redesigned caching hierarchy and security enhancements, among other features. These processors also include 
the next generation of Intel Iris Xe graphics architecture with upgraded 3D performance and media engine capabilities. 
▪GPU.  We launched the Intel Iris Xe MAX GPU for laptops and the first discrete Intel Server GPU. We also powered on our next-
generation GPU for client, referred to as DG2. 
▪Accelerator.  Habana Gaudi accelerators are at the forefront of AI solutions for data centers. Amazon Web Services announced 
that Habana Gaudi will be used to power future Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances.
▪FPGA.  We announced Intel® Stratix® 10 NX and Intel Stratix 10 AX FPGAs, extending our Intel Stratix 10 FPGA family.
Memory.  With our Intel® OptaneTM technology, we are developing products to disrupt the memory and storage hierarchy. 
▪The Intel Optane DC persistent memory 200 series is available with 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable platforms and will be supported 
with the Ice Lake server processor. The series is targeted at many workloads, including in-memory AI and analytics, databases, 
and virtual machine per container density.
Interconnect.  We deliver leading technologies that scale across all interconnect layers, spanning on-die, on-package, data center, and 
long-distance networks . 
▪We have a broad portfolio of data center connectivity products, including Intel® Ethernet, Intel® Silicon Photonics Optical 
Transceivers, and Intel® TofinoTM P4-programmable Ethernet switch ASICs.
▪The new 11th Gen Intel Core processors introduced integrated ThunderboltTM 4 and USB4. Thunderbolt 4, the next-generation 
universal cable connectivity solution, delivers increased minimum performance, expanded capabilities, and USB4 specification 
compliance. Thunderbolt 4 enables docks with up to four Thunderbolt ports and universal cables up to 2 meters in length.

Security.  We continue to deliver innovation to the market across foundational security, workload protection, and software reliability. We are 
working with customers and partners to build a more trusted foundation in a data-centric world. 
▪The new 11th Gen Intel Core processors include both TME and Intel® Control-flow Enforcement Technology (Intel® CET) security 
capabilities. TME provides the capability to encrypt the entirety of the physical memory of a system, while Intel CET delivers 
CPU-level security capabilities to help protect against common malware attack methods that have been a challenge to mitigate 
with software alone. 
▪We announced Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX), which enhance control of data security and IP protection for the 
cloud tenant while helping maintain the cloud service provider's role of managing resources and cloud-platform integrity.
Software.  Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures. 
▪We released the oneAPI open industry specification and launched the Gold release of Intel's oneAPI toolkits in support of our 
xPU roadmap. Our oneAPI toolkits enable developers to build cross-architecture applications using a single-code base across 
xPUs that take advantage of unique hardware features and lower software and maintenance cost. Developers can choose the 
best architecture for the problem they are solving without needing to rewrite software for different architectures and platforms.
▪The OpenVINO toolkit brings the full power of our xPU roadmap to the Internet of Things, client, and data center businesses. 
This complementary production-level toolkit focuses on helping developers deliver high-performance deep learning inference and 
computer vision across CPU, GPU, and FPGA products.
IP Rights
We own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&D, and other activities 
and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask work, and other rights. We actively seek to 
protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. For a detailed discussion of our IP rights, see 
"Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing" within Other Key Information.
"In addition to pledging funds, Intel gave COVID-19 scientists and researchers free access to our 
vast worldwide intellectual property portfolio this year in the hope and belief that making this 
intellectual property freely available to them will save lives. We will continue to invent—and 
protect—our intellectual property, but we offered it freely to those working to protect people from 
the pandemic."
—Steve Rodgers,  Executive Vice President and General Counsel
Manufacturing Capital
We are transforming from a traditional IDM to a modern IDM by investing to lead advances in silicon technology, leaning into our expertise 
and manufacturing scale, while evolving to engage with the ecosystem and leveraging our disaggregated design capabilities. Unlike many 
other semiconductor companies, we primarily design and manufacture our products in our own manufacturing facilities and we will 
continue to integrate engineering and manufacturing to provide new products with significant cost advantage. At the same time, our 
architectural shift to die disaggregation allows us to mix and match architectures, IP, process nodes, and silicon that creates increasing 
flexibility for our products. 
In developing new generations of manufacturing process technology, we seek to realize the benefits from Moore's Law, a law of 
economics predicted by our co-founder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago. Realizing Moore's Law can create economic benefits as 
we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we shrink its size, or increase functionality and performance of a chip while maintaining the 
same cost with higher density. This makes possible the innovation of new products with higher performance while balancing power 
efficiency, cost, and size to meet customers' needs. Our ability to optimize and apply our manufacturing expertise to deliver more 
advanced, differentiated products has been foundational to our success and is a continued focus of our investments.
"The IDM model has been foundational to Intel's success as a global leader in semiconductor 
manufacturing by enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply assurance. We 
are committed to be the supplier of choice for achieving best-in-class performance and to deliver 
world-changing products on a predictable cadence for our customers."
—Keyvan Esfarjani, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Manufacturing and Operations
We shipped higher volumes of 10nm products in 2020 than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. We also launched our 11th 
Gen Intel Core processors with new 10nm SuperFin Technology.
We announced in July 2020 that our 7nm-based CPU product timing would be delayed and that the primary driver was the yield of our 
7nm manufacturing process. We will continue to invest in our future process technology roadmap and advanced packaging technologies 
to differentiate our products, provide manufacturing optionality and deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products to our customers.Table of Contents

"Our goal is to enable leadership products for Intel by delivering predictable process and 
packaging technology innovation."
—Ann Kelleher, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Technology Development
Network and Supply Chain
Our global supply chain supports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and 
operations, sales and marketing, and business units, with the goal of enabling product and process leadership, industry-leading total cost 
of ownership, and uninterrupted supply for our customers. Our supply chain ecosystem comprises thousands of suppliers globally. Our 
worldwide site expansion projects remained on track despite disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to our own 
manufacturing capacity, we continue to use third-party foundries to expand the ways in which we can support our customers. These third-
party solutions complement our manufacturing and provide additional flexibility. Our world-class safety standards and supply chain 
operations, including our robust risk management and crisis response model, have to date allowed our worldwide factory and supply chain 
network to continue to operate safely and with mostly on-time deliveries despite the pandemic. 
"As Intel pursues an expanded data-centric market, our collaboration with our wide-ranging 
supplier ecosystem is deeper, more vibrant, and farther reaching than ever. Together with the 
ecosystem, we are focused on enabling technology advancements to deliver uninterrupted supply 
of leadership products to our customers."
—Dr. Randhir Thakur, Corporate Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer
The majority of our logic wafer manufacturing is conducted in the U.S. We have 10 manufacturing sites—six are wafer fabrication, three 
are assembly/test facilities, and our Costa Rica site added in 2020 is a test-only site. The following map shows our present factory sites 
and the countries where we have a significant R&D and/or sales presence. In response to COVID-19, we quickly made operational 
changes and adopted measures to enable a continued safe environment for our employees and operation of our manufacturing sites.
Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing, assembling, and testing of our platform and memory 
products. We operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity, 
allowing us to better analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs. Our new process technologies are transferred 
identically from a central development fab to each manufacturing facility. After transfer, the network of factories and the development fab 
collaborate to continue driving operational improvements. This enables fast ramp of the operation, fast learning, and better quality control. 
Our NAND memory fabrication facility in Dalian, China is included in the transaction entered into with SK hynix to divest our NAND 
memory business, and is part of the NAND assets held for sale as of December 26, 2020. Our Intel Optane memory business is expressly 
excluded from this transaction. The next generations of Intel Optane technology and SSDs are being developed in New Mexico following 
the sale of our non-controlling interest in IMFT to Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) in 2019. We will continue to purchase product 
manufactured by Micron under our supply agreement, which includes the next generation of Intel® 3D XPointTM technology.Table of Contents

Human Capital
Culture is critically important to Intel's success. We are re-energizing our culture to deliver on our corporate purpose and to attract, 
develop, and retain top talent needed to build transformative products and services that help our customers succeed in an increasingly 
data-driven world. We invest in our highly-skilled global workforce of 110,600 people by seeking to create a diverse, inclusive, and safe 
work environment where our employees can learn, innovate, and deliver their workplace best every day.
Our values—fearless, inclusion, customer-obsessed, one Intel, truth and transparency, and quality —guide how we make decisions, treat 
each other, and serve our customers. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Intel Code of Conduct, and Intel's 
Global Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.
"People with diverse perspectives, experiences, and input are critical to Intel’s innovation, playing 
important roles in key projects and programs across the company. An essential element of our growth 
strategy is to build a culture that empowers and inspires employees to collaborate and create, as we 
strive to become the most inclusive workplace on the planet."
—Sandra Rivera , Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer
Inclusion
Diversity and inclusion are core to Intel's values and instrumental in driving innovation and delivering 
stronger business growth. We achieved our 2020 goal of full representation in our U.S. workforce two 
years ahead of schedule, the result of an integrated strategy focused on hiring, retention, and progression. 
We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we recognize we still 
have work to do, including beyond the walls of Intel. Our RISE strategy and 2030 goals set our global 
ambitions for the next decade, including doubling the number of women in senior leadership; exceeding 
40% female representation in technical roles, including engineering positions and other roles with 
technical job requirements; increasing the percentage of employees who self-identify as having a disability 
to 10%; and ensuring accountability for embedding inclusive leadership practices across our business. 
Our goals also include doubling the number of underrepresented minorities in U.S. senior leadership. To 
drive accountability, we continue to link a portion of our executive and employee compensation to diversity 
and inclusion metrics. 
Today's greatest challenges require a shared commitment to a plan and meaningful action. That is why we 
have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to work with 
customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business practices across 
industries. We are creating and implementing a Global Inclusion Index and convening a coalition of 
companies to focus on unified goals and metrics that will be shared through the index. This collective effort 
will allow the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress. We will also continue to 
collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social equity, 
make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness  for millions of people around the world. 
Compensation and Benefits
We strive to provide pay, benefits, and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees. Our total rewards package includes 
market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, 
paid time off and family leave, parent reintegration, fertility assistance, flexible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 
2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continued to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the U.S. We achieve pay 
equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after 
accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure. We also 
advanced transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data in 2019. Although the U.S. 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did not require employers to file EEO-1 survey pay data in 2020 due to COVID-19, we felt it 
was important to continue collecting the data and to disclose it publicly in 2020. We believe that our holistic approach toward pay equity, 
representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees develop and progress in their 
careers at all levels.
To aid and support employees during COVID-19, we are investing more than $100 million in additional benefits, including special 
recognition for employees working on site. We also put in place a telecommuting reimbursement program to help employees required to 
work from home improve their workspaces, and increased flexibility in our leave programs to support employees caring for children and 
others.

 Fundamentals of Our Business Our Capital 13
Growth and Development
We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. 
We offer extensive training programs and provide rotational assignment opportunities. We implemented a new performance management 
system to support our culture evolution and to increase focus on continuous learning and development. Through our regular Employee 
Experience Surveys, employees can voice their perceptions of the company and their work experience, including learning and 
development opportunities. Our undesired turnover rate was 4% in 2020.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
Our commitment in Intel's Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy is to provide a safe and injury-free workplace. We continually invest in 
programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and 
convenient health and wellness programs, including on-site health centers, which were increasingly critical this year for our essential 
workers who have worked on site since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout our response to COVID-19, our priority has 
remained protecting the health and safety of our employees. Intel's Pandemic Leadership Team—which has been in place for 15 years—
regularly reviews and adapts our policies based on evolving research and guidance related to the virus. In support of our 2030 goals, we 
will continue to build our strong safety culture and drive global expansion of our corporate wellness program through continued employee 
education and engagement activities.
Social and Relationship Capital
We are committed to engaging in corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives that support our communities and help us develop 
trusted relationships with our stakeholders. Proactive engagement with our stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, 
including those aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading corporate citizen and 
create shared value for Intel, our global supply chain, and our communities.
Economic and social. The health of our business and local economies depends on continued investments in innovation. We provide high-
skill, high-paying jobs around the world. Many of these are manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our own domestic and international 
factories. We also benefit economies through our R&D ecosystem spending, sourcing activities, consumer spending by our employees, 
and tax payments. We make sizable capital investments and provide leadership in public-private partnerships to spur economic growth 
and innovation.
We stand at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to empower individuals, companies, and governments 
around the world to solve major societal challenges. We also aim to empower people through education and advance social initiatives to 
create career pathways into the technology industry. This has included our global Intel AI for Youth program, scaled in partnership with 
governments and institutions to empower youth with digital readiness and AI skills, as well as our multi-year partnerships with historically 
black colleges and universities in the U.S. aimed at increasing the number of African Americans who pursue electrical engineering, 
computer engineering, and computer science fields. Our employees and retirees actively share their expertise through volunteer initiatives 
in the communities where we operate. These efforts contributed more than 10 million hours of service over the past decade, and our new 
goals include a commitment to volunteer an additional 10 million hours by 2030. In 2020, we volunteered 910 thousand hours. COVID-19 
presented challenges for in-person volunteering, resulting in lower reported volunteer hours compared to prior years. However, we saw an 
outpouring of support from employees for virtual volunteering, donations, and innovative technology projects to support our communities.  
In April, we announced the Pandemic Response Technology Initiative, a commitment of $50 million to combat COVID-19. Our focus is to 
leverage our technology, expertise, resources, and our global ecosystem, to accelerate access to technology that can combat the current 
pandemic and get ahead of future pandemics through scientific discovery, enable remote learning for students, and aid in economic 
recovery. To date, we have partnered with many organizations on numerous projects across sectors, including technology, healthcare, 
education, industrial, retail, transportation, and academia.
Human rights commitment.  We are committed to maintaining and improving processes to avoid human rights violations related to our 
operations, supply chain, and products. We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our business, 
including board-level oversight and the involvement of senior-level Management Review Committees. We also meet throughout the year 
with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies and oversight 
processes. While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end users may 
develop, we do not tolerate our products being used to violate human rights. Where we become aware of a concern that Intel products are 
being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we restrict or cease business with the third party until we 
have high confidence that Intel's products are not being used to violate human rights. As a result, in 2020 we restricted certain sales 
based on our Human Rights Principles that would have otherwise been considered lawful.
Supply Chain Responsibility
We actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve 
overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices 
throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. 
We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate 
and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we will advance collaboration across our 
industry on responsible minerals sourcing.Table of Contents
 
 Fundamentals of Our Business Our Capital 14
Over the past decade, we have directly engaged with our suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and 
bonded labor and other human rights issues. We perform supplier audits and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-
building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and our 
Code of Conduct. The suppliers covered by these audits represent 78% of cash payments made to managed suppliers. We also engage 
with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and supplier diversity. Although COVID-19 
presented travel and safety challenges in 2020 that impacted our ability to complete as many in-person supplier audits as in the previous 
year, we continued to engage with our suppliers and communicate our expectations and requirements. To achieve our 2030 goals, we will 
significantly expand the number of suppliers covered by our engagement activities to deepen accountability for human rights.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our suppliers. We believe a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation 
and value for our business. We achieved our 2020 goal to reach $1 billion in annual spending with diverse-owned suppliers and our new 
2030 goals include doubling this figure over the next decade. Beginning in 2021, we will not retain or use outside law firms in the U.S. that 
are average or below average on diversity for their equity partners. We are applying a similar rule to firms used by our tax department, 
including non-legal firms.
Natural Capital
Driving to the lowest environmental footprint possible helps create efficiencies, lower costs, and respond to the needs of our stakeholders. 
We invest in conservation projects and set company-wide environmental targets to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy 
use, water use, and waste generation. We build energy efficiency into our products to help our customers lower their own emissions and 
energy costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use technology to address environmental challenges. We 
achieved our 2020 greenhouse gas goal, reducing our emissions 39% on a per unit basis from 2010 levels. Through our 2030 goals we 
will continue to drive to higher levels of operational efficiency, including a further 10% reduction in our carbon emissions on an absolute 
basis even as we continue to grow. Our 2030 strategy and goals also focus on improving product energy efficiency and increasing our 
"handprint"—the ways in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions that enable 
intelligence in machines, buildings, supply chains, and factories, and make electrical grids smarter, safer, and more efficient. 
Climate and Energy
We focus on reducing our own climate impact, and over the past two decades have reduced our direct emissions and indirect emissions 
associated with energy consumption. We achieved our 2020 energy goal, saving more than 4.5 billion kWh since 2012 by investing in 
energy conservation projects in our global operations. In 2020, we conserved more than 155 million kWh of energy in support of our new 
2030 goal to conserve an additional 4 billion kWh of energy over the next 10 years. In addition to conserving energy, we invest in green 
power and on-site alternative energy projects that provide power directly to our buildings. We continue to link a portion of our executive 
and employee compensation to corporate responsibility metrics. In 2020, these included a climate-related metric to use 75% renewable 
energy globally during the year, which supports our 2030 goal to achieve 100% renewable energy use across our global manufacturing 
operations. In 2020, we signed on to RE100, a global coalition of businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity use. 
We are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform 
our disclosure on climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. For governance and strategy, we follow an 
integrated approach to address climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives, and 
policies. Strategies and progress toward goals are reviewed with senior executives and the Intel Board of Directors' Corporate 
Governance and Nominating Committee. We describe our overall risk management processes in our Proxy Statement, and describe our 
climate-related risks and opportunities in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, the Intel Climate Change Policy, and "Risk Factors" 
within this Form 10-K. In addition to what is included within this Form 10-K, results of our 2020 goals and information on our 2030 goals, 
are included in our Corporate Responsibility Report. Our Corporate Responsibility Report includes a mapping of our disclosure to the 
TCFD, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework, and our CDP Climate Change Survey, all available on our website.1 
Water Stewardship
Water is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. We use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and 
we use fresh and reclaimed water to run our manufacturing facility systems. Over the past decade, our sustainable water management 
efforts and partnerships have enabled us to conserve billions of gallons of water, and through our 2030 goals we have committed to 
conserve an additional 60 billion gallons in this decade. As part of this commitment, we plan to achieve net positive water use globally. In 
2020, we linked a portion of our executive and employee compensation to our target to conserve more than 5 billion gallons of water in 
our operations and fund new water restoration projects in collaboration with environmental and community partners that restore more than 
1 billion gallons of water during the year to local watersheds.

Circular Economy and Waste Management
We have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies  that enable the recovery and productive 
re-use of waste streams. We achieved our 2020 waste management goals, reaching a 93% recycle rate for our non-hazardous waste and 
sending zero hazardous waste to landfills.1 Our 2030 goals include a target of zero total waste to landfill, as well as implementation of 
circular economy strategies for 60% of our manufacturing waste streams in partnership with our suppliers. This can include reuse of waste 
streams directly in our own operations or enabling reuse of our waste streams by other industries.
Value We Create
Each of our six forms of capital plays a critical role in our long-term value creation. We consider numerous indicators in determining the 
success of our capital deployment in creating value. Highlights of value created in 2020 are as follows:

Market and Business Overview
Market Trends and Strategy
Data is a significant force in society, and is being generated at an unprecedented pace. The future of technology is being shaped by the 
rise of several technology inflections: 
▪The levels of efficiency and scale that cloud architectures brought to the data center are now being extended to the network and 
edge. Workloads are no longer static between enterprises and public clouds; they are distributed to a mix of hybrid and multi-
cloud.
▪5G will enable rich new experiences and services, fundamentally changing the way we think of compute and requiring most 
networks to transform.
▪AI is fundamental and becoming pervasive in all applications, and is enabling customers to leverage the power of data.
▪The edge is demanding more and more compute closer to where data is being created and consumed, driving a new wave of 
multifunction, compute-hungry devices.
Data centers—whether in the cloud, the network, or at the edge—will go through a massive architectural transformation in the coming 
years, leveraging heterogeneous computing with different types of processor architectures optimized for different workloads. With 
unmatched scale, portfolio breadth, and ecosystem support, we are uniquely positioned to unlock the value of data for people, business, 
and society on a global scale. 
Cloud revenue grew in 2020, driven by rapidly expanding hyperscaler demand for capacity, peaking in the first half with inventory 
digestion throughout the remainder of the year. The on-premises enterprise business experienced cyclical declines due to sustained 
COVID-19 workplace trends and macroeconomic uncertainty; enterprise customers continue to embrace cloud as an alternative to 
traditional legacy architectures. The communications service providers segment continued to grow, accelerating the global transformation 
of the network and edge through 5G-enabled solutions.
Products and Competitiveness
We offer customers a broad portfolio of 
silicon and software designed to provide 
workload-optimized performance across 
compute, storage, and network. As a 
leading provider of data center platforms, 
we face competition from competitors 
such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 
(AMD), providers of GPU products such 
as NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA), 
companies using ARM* architecture, new 
entrants developing products customized 
for specific data center workloads, and 
internally developed solutions by cloud 
service providers and others. We expect 
an increasingly competitive environment 
in 2021.
We are now shipping our 10nm-based 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (previously referred to as Ice Lake). In 2020, we 
introduced our 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (previously referred to as Cooper Lake) accompanied by the Intel Optane DC 
persistent memory 200 series. As the industry's only mainstream data center CPUs with built-in AI acceleration, Intel Xeon processors are 
helping customers solve problems and gain insight for future opportunities. We also collaborated with 5G leaders to design the world's first 
standard, high-volume silicon for radio access networks, the Intel Atom P5900 processor, designed from the ground up for 5G wireless 
base stations. Since acquiring Habana Labs in December 2019, we aligned our specialized AI accelerator investments around the 
Habana Gaudi training processor and we began shipping Goya inference processors this year, which contributed to advancing our AI 
strategy. Amazon Web Services announced that Habana Gaudi will be used to power future Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances. In 
the connectivity space, we brought together Barefoot Networks' programmable Ethernet switch technology and our silicon photonics

Market and Business Overview
Market Trends and Strategy
The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global vehicle industry, resulting in a year over year decline in overall production of 
approximately 17%3, and delayed deployment of certain OEMs' advanced features and other projects. We expect ADAS volume to 
recover from the effects of COVID-19 faster than overall global vehicle production, and we expect long-term growth of ADAS to remain 
unaffected as consumers increasingly consider ADAS a differentiating factor in their automotive purchasing decisions. 
The continued growth of ADAS is dependent on various factors, including regulation, market demand, and consumers' recognition of its 
value. Mobileye's ADAS solutions also serve as a qualification space for our autonomous technology, using vast experience and 
proliferation to validate and constantly improve AV technology. This year, we introduced Mobileye Supervision, the EyeQ5-based solution 
that incorporates an end-to-end engine control unit, surround-view camera array, processors, driving policy, and high-definition maps—all 
derived directly from our ongoing autonomous vehicle program. AV technologies such as Mobileye Supervision will make their way into 
premium ADAS solutions, broadening monetization opportunities and value proposition.

MD&A 25
Despite the COVID-19-related impact on vehicle production, OEMs are still looking to enhance current L2+ solutions by improving system 
fidelity, availability, and performance. High-definition maps with constant updates, global coverage, and various semantic features are 
prerequisites for L2+ applications and the future deployment of robotaxi and passenger car autonomy (Consumer AV). Canonical mapping 
methods rely on extensive manual labor and dedicated mapping vehicles. Mobileye's disruptive REM crowdsource mapping technology 
provides automatic map creation and updates. REM mapping capabilities are also being leveraged to extend the value of static and 
dynamic data to businesses in new market segments such as smart cities and infrastructure surveys.
We believe the future of autonomous driving will unfold in two phases: commercial robotaxi and series-production passenger car 
consumer AVs. We expect consumer AVs to materialize only after the robotaxi industry deploys and matures. The main inhibitors of a 
mass market product offering of consumer AV are the cost of AV technology, ability to scale at a low cost, regulatory framework, and 
public acceptance. Thus, we see the robotaxi phase as a necessary corridor to consumer AV. Mobileye is well-positioned to play a 
significant role in the broader MaaS market with the commercialization of robotaxi and the future consumer AV market. Our full-stack self-
driving system—geared with our camera-centric backbone and vast experience in productizing cutting-edge technology in the automotive 
industry—is the foundation for developing an economically competitive AV solution. Proliferation of data-collection vehicles alongside 
REM technology will allow for low-cost geographic expansion and coverage. Together with Moovit's complementary assets in the service 
layers, Mobileye is building itself as an end-to-end service provider at scale.
Until the UNECE, EU, and U.S. provide regulation for self-driving vehicles without safety drivers for commercial ride sharing and public 
transportation, several countries are pushing to enact laws and regulation by 2021 to enable regular deployment and operation of MaaS 
fleets with self-driving vehicles starting in 2022. 
Products and Competitiveness
Our offering for ADAS and AV is propelled by our computer vision and AI expertise and software assets, deployed on our EyeQ SoC 
family. The tight co-design of hardware and software gives the EyeQ SoC the ability to support complex and computationally intense tasks 
and sets it apart from competition because it is purpose-fit for high-compute, low-power, automotive-compliant mission profiles. Our 5th 
Gen EyeQ5 SoC is designed to act as the central computer for fully autonomous driving vehicles. We have been able to achieve power, 
performance, and cost targets by employing proprietary computational cores that are optimized for a wide variety of computer vision, 
signal processing, and machine learning tasks, including deep neural networks. Starting with EyeQ5, we are supporting an automotive-
grade standard operating system and providing a complete software development kit to allow customers to differentiate their solutions by 
deploying their algorithms on EyeQ5. The EyeQ5 SoC is expected to be in commercial vehicles starting in 2021 and is already operational 
in our autonomous test vehicles.
EyeQ5 serves as the computational foundation for our scalable camera-only surround sensing system. The system consists of multiple 
independent computer vision engines and deep networks for algorithmic redundancy. The result is a robust and comprehensive model of 
the environment that allows end-to-end autonomous driving. The surround computer vision system is the backbone of Mobileye's AV 
architecture and the flagship offering for next-generation ADAS.
The next significant building block in our complete offering is REM mapping technology, which compiles crowdsourced mapping data from 
EyeQ SoC-equipped vehicles. We are focused on our crowd-sourced mapping efforts and expect a significant increase in harvesting 
capabilities in 2021. We also expect an expansion of the number of vehicles using our localization capabilities by the end of 2021. The 
REM RoadbookTM can enhance current ADAS applications through a variety of advanced features, including predictive adaptive cruise 
control, lane-level localization in all weather and road conditions, hands-free driving application, and real-time alerts.
Leveraging this data, we launched a full suite of vision-based data services for cities, road operators, transportation authorities, and 
mapping companies. Using vehicles equipped with Mobileye's road mapping technology, we provide highly refreshed geographic 
information systems data about the road network, infrastructure assets, pavement condition, mobility, and traffic. This information allows 
our customers to monitor and preserve their infrastructure more efficiently, making roadways and streets safer for all.
The third building block in our full stack offering is our unique formal model for AV safety (RSS). At its core, RSS is a pragmatic method to 
design and then efficiently validate the safety of an AV, serving as the governing safety layer for the decision-making system. RSS 
formalizes human decision making for safe driving under two main principles: first, it acknowledges the need to balance safety with useful 
driving by making plausible worst-case scenario assumptions for other road users; and second, it provides a technology-neutral model 
and a transparent framework for the regulatory endeavor of building an industry standard for safety. In late 2019, Intel was named to lead 
the IEEE working group to develop AV decision making standards.
These building blocks are already part of our recently launched Mobileye Supervision, a direct derivative of our autonomous driving

In 2019, revenue was $72.0 billion, up $1.1 billion, or 2%, from 2018. Our data-centric businesses collectively grew 3% year over year and 
made up nearly half of our total revenue in 2019. Platform ASPs increased due to stronger core mix offset by a decline in NSG ASPs due 
to lower NAND market pricing and a decrease in DCG platform unit sales as the enterprise and government market segment contracted. 
Our PC-centric business was flat year over year as ASP strength from richer commercial segment mix and modem growth were offset by 
declines in platform volume. Table of Contents

Gross Margin
We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars from the sale of platform products in the DCG and CCG operating segments. Our 
overall gross margin dollars in 2020 increased by $1.5 billion, or approximately 3%, compared to 2019, and in 2019 decreased by $1.6 
billion, or 4%, compared to 2018. Our gross margin percentage was down as the increase in platform revenue was offset by higher 
platform unit cost and a higher portion of our revenue from lower margin adjacent businesses.

Ongoing mark-to-market net gains and losses reported during 2020 were primarily driven by Montage Technology, Co. Ltd. (Montage); 
2019 and 2018 net gains and losses were primarily driven by ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) and Cloudera. In 2019, we sold our equity 
investment in ASML.
During 2020, we recognized higher than historically experienced impairment charges on our non-marketable portfolio based on our 
assessment of the impact of recent public and private market volatility and tightening of liquidity. We recognized impairments of 
$290 million on non-marketable equity securities ($122 million in 2019 and $132 million in 2018). In 2018, we recognized an impairment 
charge of $290 million in our equity method investment in IMFT. 
In sale of equity investments and other, we recognized $1.1 billion on the initial fair value adjustment from a Montage holding becoming 
marketable and $606 million related to four other equity investments that went public in 2020. We recognized McAfee dividends of $126 
million in 2020 and $632 million in 2019, and in 2019 we recognized $107 million from our sale of our non-controlling interest in IMFT.
Interest and Other, Net
We recognized a net loss in interest and other in 2020 compared to a net gain in 2019, primarily due to lower divestiture gains in 2020 
compared to 2019.
We recognized a higher net gain in interest and other in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower loss on debt conversions and

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources: 
(In Millions) Dec 26, 2020 Dec 28, 2019
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets $ 23,895 $ 13,123

Reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months $ — $ 350 
Total debt $ 36,401 $ 29,001 
Temporary equity $ — $ 155 
Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. When assessing our sources of liquidity, we include cash and investments 
as shown in the preceding table. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and 
country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities.
Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the 
SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, 
we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of December 26, 2020, we had no 
commercial paper outstanding. During 2020, we issued a total of $10.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and repaid 
$1.0 billion of our 1.85% senior notes that matured in May 2020 and $1.8 billion of our 2.45% senior notes that matured in July 2020. We 
also repaid $700 million in floating-rate senior notes that matured in May 2020. Additionally, we paid $1.1 billion to satisfy conversion 
obligations for the remaining $372 million of our $2.0 billion 2009 Debentures. 
On March 24, 2020, we suspended the use of our financial resources for stock repurchases. On August 19, 2020, in response to our belief 
that our stock was trading well below its intrinsic valuation at that time, we entered into ASR agreements to repurchase an aggregate of 
$10.0 billion of our common stock. In total, we have repurchased approximately $17.6 billion in shares as part of our planned $20.0 billion 
share repurchases announced in October 2019. We intend to complete the remaining $2.4 billion balance of these planned repurchases 
in Q1 2021. 
We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures 
for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential acquisitions, strategic investments, 
dividends, and common stock repurchases.Table of Contents

Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,671 $ 1,175 $ (414) Table of Contents
MD&A 43
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
For 2020 compared to 2019, the $2.2 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working 
capital. Changes in working capital were driven by accounts receivable, inventory, and income taxes, offset by other assets and liabilities.
For 2019 compared to 2018, the $3.7 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working 
capital. Changes in working capital were driven by taxes, other assets and liabilities, and accounts receivable, offset by customer 
utilization of prepaid supply agreement payments and inventory build. 
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals, and proceeds from 
divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $14.3 billion in 2020, excluding NAND capital expenditures 
subsequent to the held for sale date ($16.2 billion in 2019 and $15.2 billion in 2018). 
The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-
for-sale debt investments and trading assets, offset by an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale debt investments and 
trading assets, and a decrease in capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions.
The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to net trading asset activity, acquisitions, 
and capital expenditures. The increase was partially offset by net available-for-sale debt investment activity.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of 
short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.
The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by long-
term debt issuances, offset by an increase in repayments of debt and debt conversions and an increase in repurchases of common stock. 
During 2020, we repurchased $14.2 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $13.6 
billion in 2019. As of December 26, 2020, $9.7 billion remained available for repurchasing common stock under the repurchase 
authorization limit. Our total dividend payments were $5.6 billion in 2020 compared to $5.6 billion in 2019. We have paid a cash dividend 
in each of the past 113 quarters. 
The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased long-term debt issuance, 
offset by increased repurchases of common stock. Table of Contents

1Operating lease obligations represent the undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases, but exclude non-lease components. 
2Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as 
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 26, 2020, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the 
property.
3Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or 
services. 
4Tax obligations represent the future cash payments related to Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on our previously untaxed 
foreign earnings. For further information, see "Note 8: Income Taxes" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
5Amounts represent principal payments for all debt obligations and interest payments for fixed-rate debt obligations. Interest payments on floating-
rate debt obligations, as well as the impact of fixed-rate to floating-rate debt swaps, are excluded.
6Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the short-
term portion of these long-term liabilities. Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table because they do not represent the amounts 
that may ultimately be paid.
7Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions 
of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.
The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments 
and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for 
some obligations.
Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in "Other purchase obligations and commitments" in the preceding 
table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum 
quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations 
with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement 
terms or the minimum cancellation fee.
For the purchase of raw materials, we have entered into certain agreements that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a 
percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the 
future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these 
agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current 
manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent 
authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. 
Approximately half of our milestone-based contracts are tooling related for the purchase of capital equipment. These arrangements are 
not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty.  As of December 26, 2020, assuming that all future 
milestones are met, the additional required payments would be approximately $530 million.
For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum 
statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to 
pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In 
addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.Table of Contents

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management 
programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are 
based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. Actual results may 
differ materially. 
Currency Exchange Rates
We are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments and loans 
receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest 
rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related 
hedging instruments. We are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness and may use 
foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk.
Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital 
purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan. We have 
established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-U.S. dollar 
forecasted future cash flows and existing non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from 
funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or 
option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was 
reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. 
Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability 
positions outstanding as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of 
less than $61 million and less than $38 million, respectively.
Interest Rates
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our 
investment policy is to preserve principal and the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track 
the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment 
with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. We also enter into swaps to convert 
fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are 
generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.
A hypothetical increase in benchmark interest rates of up to 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a 
decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $75 million as of December 26, 2020 (a hypothetical decrease of 
1% would have resulted in an increase of approximately $88 million as of December 28, 2019).
Taking into account floating-rate debt and fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 
up to 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense on our indebtedness of approximately $132 million from debt outstanding 
as of December 26, 2020 (an increase of approximately $139 million from debt outstanding as of December 28, 2019). 
Equity Prices
We are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce 
or eliminate through hedging activities. 
As of December 26, 2020, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $1.8 billion ($450 million as of December 28, 2019). 
Substantially all of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 26, 2020 was concentrated in securities traded on the 
Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market 
value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 
60% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by approximately $1.1 billion, based on the 
value as of December 26, 2020 (a decrease in value of approximately $180 million, based on the value as of December 28, 2019 using an 
assumed decline of 40%). 
We utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation 
arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the 
related liabilities.Table of Contents
MD&A 46
Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, 
although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the 
companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through 
liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and 
there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our 
investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $3.3 billion as of December 26, 2020 ($3.5 billion as of 
December 28, 2019) and included our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $658 million ($658 million as of December 28, 
2019). The carrying amount of our equity method investments was $18 million as of December 26, 2020 ($37 million as of December 28, 
2019). 
Commodity Price Risk
Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We 
have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use 
commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that 
are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities. Table of Contents

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial 
measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our 
operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of 
business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and 
measuring our performance.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax 
effects where applicable. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment. These non-GAAP 
financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 
and the financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.
Non-GAAP 
adjustment or 
measure Definition Usefulness to management and investors
Acquisition-related 
adjustmentsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 
consists of amortization of intangible assets such as 
developed technology, brands, and customer 
relationships acquired in connection with business 
combinations. Charges related to the amortization of 
these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales 
and MG&A in our U.S. GAAP financial statements. 
Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated 
useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and 
thus are generally recorded over multiple years.We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-
related intangible assets for purposes of calculating 
certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are 
inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the 
timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These 
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current 
operating performance and comparison to our past 
operating performance and provide investors with 
additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.
Restructuring and 
other chargesRestructuring charges are costs associated with a 
formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to 
employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other 
charges include asset impairments, pension charges, 
and costs associated with restructuring activity.We exclude restructuring and other charges, including 
any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because these costs do not reflect our current operating 
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful 
evaluation of our current operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results and provide 
investors with additional means to evaluate expense 
trends.
Gains (losses) from 
divestitureGains or losses are recognized at the close of a 
divestiture.We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures 
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because they do not reflect our current operating 
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful 
evaluation of our current operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results.
Ongoing mark-to-
market on 
marketable equity 
securitiesAfter the initial mark-to-market adjustment is recorded 
upon a security becoming marketable, gains and losses 
are recognized from ongoing mark-to-market 
adjustments of our marketable equity securities.We exclude these ongoing gains and losses for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because we do not believe this volatility correlates to our 
core operational performance. These adjustments 
facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating 
performance and comparisons to past operating results.
Tax Reform We made adjustments to the original estimate of 
income tax expense resulting from Tax Reform.We exclude adjustments to the provisional tax estimate 
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because they are the result of regulatory change and do 
not reflect our current operating performance. These 
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current 
operating performance and comparisons to past 
operating results.
Free cash flow We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of free 
cash flow, which is used by management when 
assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, 
and quality of earnings. Free cash flow is operating 
cash flow adjusted to exclude additions to property, 
plant and equipment. We also reference a ratio of free 
cash flow to non-GAAP net income.This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in 
understanding our capital requirements and provides an 
additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our 
business. We excluded additions to held for sale NAND 
property, plant and equipment because the additions are 
not representative of our long-term capital requirements 
and we expect these assets to be sold. The ratio of free 
cash flow to non-GAAP net income is helpful in 
comparing the results and trends of our adjusted cash 
flow to income.Table of Contents

Sales and Marketing
Customers
We sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to 
branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as 
industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers, who buy our products through distributor, 
reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted 
for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel® processors and 
other products from our distributors. We have incentive programs that allow distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in 
small quantities to systems integrators. Our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.
Sales Arrangements
Our products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order 
acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as 
indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us 
on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and 
without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our 
standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using 
electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods 
ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other 
incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.
In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to 
the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that 
payment is due at a later date, 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. 
From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support 
protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred 
due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. 
Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on 
stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between 
the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price 
protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of 
a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by 
the distributor. 
Distribution
Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. 
Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity 
to key customers.
Seasonal Trends
Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the 
third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. Due to COVID-19 related impacts on demand in 2020, net revenue was higher in the first 
half of the year due to strong notebook platform demand driven by the increase in working and learning from home, and strength in data 
center demand as cloud service providers increased capacity. 
Marketing
Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives 
preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid 
businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, 
Celeron, Pentium, and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year, we added a new GPU brand, Intel Iris. We also 
introduced the Intel Evo platform brand for designs based on 11th Gen Intel Core processors.
In 2020, we launched our new brand that signals our business transformation. We promote brand awareness and preference, and 
generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily 
include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer 
communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating 
demand for our products. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such 
as connectivity.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 51
Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs 
broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel® logos on 
computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The 
program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel® brands, subject to customers meeting defined 
criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. 
We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.
Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing 
Intel owns and develops significant IP and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, R&D, and other activities 
and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and mask work rights. We actively 
seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, 
particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. For a 
discussion of the risks related to IP and our IP rights, see "We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory 
proceedings" in "Risk Factors" within this section. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not 
significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.
We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the 
comparative pace of governments' patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in 
some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our product offerings into new 
industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our 
own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as 
companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance 
that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on 
favorable terms or at all.
The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and 
other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our 
products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing 
genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential 
the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding 
matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that 
were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate 
methodology, could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial 
Statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available 
when the estimate was made.
Refer to "Note 2: Accounting Policies" within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting 
estimates and policies, which are as follows:
▪Inventories —the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory, excluding factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the 
lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand and market conditions; 
▪Long-lived assets —the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of property, plant and equipment, 
identified intangibles, and goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to 
reporting units;
▪Non-marketable equity investments —the valuation estimates and assessment of impairment and observable price adjustments; and
▪Loss contingencies —the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.Table of Contents

Risk Factors
The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, and the 
trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be 
affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and 
uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends 
should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including 
in the MD&A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.
Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results. 
Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our 
products varies within or among the market segments served by our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. It is difficult to forecast these 
changes and their impact. For example, we saw negative COVID-driven demand impacts in several areas of our business during the 
second half of 2020, as discussed in MD&A, and the nature and extent of future impacts are difficult to predict. Changes in the demand for 
our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products, can reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write 
down the value of our assets.
Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:
▪business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;
▪consumer confidence or income levels, and the levels of customer capital spending, which may be impacted by changes in market 
conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; expected inflation; 
employment; and energy or other commodity prices;
▪our ability to timely introduce competitive products; 
▪competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;
▪the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;
▪customer order patterns, including order cancellations, which can be affected by maturing product cycles for our products, customers' 
products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; disruptions affecting customers; and other factors;
▪market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products, including the introduction and availability of products 
used together with our products; and
▪customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user 
computing workloads.
Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may 
incur significant charges and costs.  Because we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are 
fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and 
equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases or we fail to 
forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross 
margin. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we 
may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful 
lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. Conversely, at times product demand increases or we fail to 
forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded, and we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, or 
otherwise fail to meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to 
customer relationships. 
We face significant competition.  The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market 
developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent 
product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate and/or respond to these developments, our competitive position can 
weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified, and we 
expect it to continue to do so in the future.
Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload 
optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap 
execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and 
market segment. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements 
and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. In our IOTG business, for 
example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive 
factors. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive 
landscape, our business and results of operation can be harmed.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 53
We face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; 
accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific 
standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. 
Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, 
and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and 
application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and 
servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed 
semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically 
integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For 
example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our 
client CPUs.
Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC) or Samsung 
Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. 
Manufacturing process improvements introduced by TSMC have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive 
offerings by our competitors. As an IDM, we have higher capital expenditures and R&D spending than many of our "fabless" competitors. 
We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business 
collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For 
example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply 
chains.
Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand 
for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our DCG platform 
ASPs were impacted by the competitive pricing environment during 2020. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic 
partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 
2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. 
Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.
If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and 
we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.
We invest significantly in R&D, and to the extent our R&D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may 
not realize a return on our investments.  To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and 
manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&D efforts 
across several key areas: process and packaging technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security, and software. These include 
ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the 
benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, 
and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations, as discussed in the 
risk factor “We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology.” To 
the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve transistor density with sufficient 
manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and 
time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new product designs. To the extent 
our R&D efforts do not timely produce semiconductor designs for our platform products with improvements in areas like performance, 
performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our 
competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which 
different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into 
a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of 
advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays 
or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, 
adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result 
in delays in the development of the associated product.
We do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products fail, and the 
products and technologies we invest in and develop are not always well received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. 
We make significant investments in R&D, and our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, 
if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. 
Our investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. In recent years, we have 
entered new areas and introduced new products as we seek to lead in key technology inflections such as AI, 5G networking, and the 
intelligent and autonomous edge. We have expanded our adjacent product offerings in client computing, the data center, the Internet of 
Things, and memory, with offerings such as discrete GPUs, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. These 
efforts are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that 
there was no clear path to profitability for the business. Table of Contents
Other Key Information 54
These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our expanded TAM, and they also introduce new sources 
of competition, including, in some of these market segments, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and 
customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant 
investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes utilize technologies that are different from the ones that we develop 
and manufacture, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly 
driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing 
technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking 
infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not 
succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market 
segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, time-to-market, and energy efficiency of our 
products, as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Some of these new 
businesses face challenging market conditions. For example, market pricing for NAND memory products has been, and may continue to 
be, highly volatile. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for 
our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to 
impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.
Changes in the mix of products sold can materially impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and 
market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our 
platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end 
platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced 
platform products, and at times are not profitable. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in 
any of our market segments, or our adjacent products represent an increasingly greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross 
margin percentage may decrease.
We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.
We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing technologies.  Production of integrated 
circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly 
advanced nodes as we seek to realize the benefits of Moore's Law. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced 
nodes is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the 
manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often 
takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes. 
We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We  
experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology. Although we began shipping products based on our 10nm 
process technology in volume in 2019, our delays in transitioning to this node occurred while third-party foundries such as TSMC 
developed new, competitive process technologies. Competitors using third-party foundries are able to benefit from the improvements such 
process technologies have made in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which has helped increase the competitiveness of 
their products. In 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our 7nm process technology that resulted in yield 
degradation, which was the primary driver for a delay in our expectations for our 7nm-based CPU product timing. These delays can allow 
competitors to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us by third-party foundries and could 
adversely affect the competitiveness of our products. Because of the delays in our 10nm and 7nm process technologies, we may 
experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies 
and products. To increase our manufacturing and design flexibility, we have developed a disaggregated design approach for certain 
products, which enables us to manufacture processors and components on different process technologies, including third-party foundry 
processes, and connect them in a single package with advanced packaging technologies. This approach introduces additional risks as 
described in the risk factor “We face supply chain risks.” 
Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-
generation process technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the process 
node introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the 
expected cost and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D investments, particularly as 
development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of 
some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 55
Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated 
manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times 
caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer 
relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, including additional cores or other 
competitive features in our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. 
Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product 
costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. When we introduce a new process 
node, it typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields. For 
example, our increased 10nm product mix in 2020 had a negative impact on our overall unit cost and gross margins, and yields on our 
10nm manufacturing process remain below our mature 14nm process. In addition, the improvements we expect to make in 10nm costs 
and yields may not proceed at the same rate as the improvements we made on 14nm. As the die size of our products has increased and 
our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more 
susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields.
From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating 
permits and licenses, interruptions in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test 
facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which 
could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. 
Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our 
business and the results of operations. In addition, delays in our product introductions can cause us to become less competitive and lose 
revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in the product 
development stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.
We face supply chain risks.  Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our 
business. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain materials and equipment, including certain 
photolithography tools, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, supplier 
consolidation or business failures can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. 
Finding and qualifying alternate or additional suppliers is often a lengthy process and can lead to production delays or additional costs, 
and such alternatives are sometimes not available at all. The inability of suppliers to deliver necessary production materials or equipment 
can disrupt our production processes and make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Suppliers periodically extend 
lead times, face capacity constraints, limit supplies, increase prices, experience quality issues, or encounter cybersecurity or other issues 
that can interrupt or increase the cost of our supply. Our production can be disrupted by the unavailability of resources, such as water, 
silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources at times requires us to 
reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our manufacturing operations and 
ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a 
supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others.
We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture, assemble and test, and supply certain components and products, including for areas 
such as networking, communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. We may utilize third-party providers for these 
and other components and products in the future. From time to time, these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely 
or cost-effective basis, in sufficient volumes, or at all. In some cases there are limited or no readily available satisfactory alternate 
providers. In any of these circumstances, we can encounter supply delays or disruptions or incur additional costs that could prevent us 
from meeting customer demand and/or adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, while we have a supply 
agreement with Micron providing for the supply of Intel 3D XPoint memory, we may need to fund and develop internal manufacturing 
options to continue 3D XPoint memory supply in the longer term. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and 
manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are 
manufactured or supplied by third parties.
Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different 
components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single 
package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may 
have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the 
manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In 
addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity 
and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed, 
our costs could increase, and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected.
Increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices could cause our compliance costs to increase 
or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation. Moreover, given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our 
products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do not directly control the procurement or employment practices of 
such suppliers, we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risks as a result of our suppliers' conduct.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 56
We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues.  From time to time, we identify product defects, errata 
(deviations from published specifications), and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our 
manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or attain 
through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues can lead to product failures, unpredictable system behavior, system 
instability, and other issues, and sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. We 
also face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, 
even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new 
devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, 
financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses. 
Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:
▪writing off some or all of the value of inventory;
▪recalling products that have been shipped;
▪providing product replacements or modifications;
▪providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;
▪defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and
▪paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.
These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation 
techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis—or 
at all—and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications, and can result in adverse 
performance or power effects. We and third parties, such as hardware and software vendors, may make prioritization decisions about 
which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation 
and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other issues can damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product 
releases, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, 
our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be 
unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.
We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to 
our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact 
with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard 
specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. As we have become a more data-centric 
company, our processors and other products are being used in additional and new critical application areas that create new or increased 
cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of 
Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category 
known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as "Spectre" and "Meltdown." Additional categories and variants 
have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in, 
and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities, including with respect to 
security and manageability features in our products. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our 
customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a 
vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop 
that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy 
mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address 
future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or 
regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.
Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative 
measures, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve 
vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services 
vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and 
performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether and 
how to develop and deploy mitigations. We and such third parties may make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, 
which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or 
mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, 
data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which 
they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 57
Security vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of 
operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For 
example, whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to 
developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, 
responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product 
replacements or modifications, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities 
or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may 
be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively 
mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before 
mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, 
or otherwise harm our business and reputation. 
We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations.  The manufacturing and assembly and test of our 
products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and 
regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of 
production; alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations 
or sales.
Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to 
increased costs or future liabilities. Our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by 
environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to 
acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Regulations in 
response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements and increased 
compliance and energy costs. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under 
environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or 
requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.
The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of 
operations. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected significant portions of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our 
financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to numerous pandemic-related risks, including those described below. The 
degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, 
including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, other 
actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the virus and resulting economic disruption, and how quickly 
and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of 
the pandemic on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other partners, and their financial conditions, but a material effect on these 
parties could also materially adversely affect us. 
Operational risks. The pandemic has resulted in authorities imposing, and businesses and individuals implementing , numerous measures 
to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter -in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, 
and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, 
and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. We have significant manufacturing operations in the U.S., Ireland, Israel, 
China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and is taking measures to try to contain it. 
There is considerable uncertainty regarding the business impacts from such measures and potential future measures. Shelter-in-place 
orders and other measures, including work-from-home and social distancing policies implemented to protect employees, have resulted in 
reduced workforce availability at some of our sites, construction delays, and reduced capacity at some of our vendors and suppliers. 
Restrictions on our manufacturing or support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers, can impact our 
ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly 
if prolonged. Similarly, current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation can also impact our ability to meet demand and could 
materially adversely affect us. Our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions in their operations and 
supply chains, which can result in delayed, reduced, or cancelled orders, or collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of 
operations. We previously paused new construction projects at several of our manufacturing sites due to local government restrictions. 
While these restrictions were subsequently lifted, similar restrictions affecting construction could be imposed again in the future.
The pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including with respect to employee travel; employee work locations; 
cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences; and social distancing measures. We may take further actions 
as required by government authorities or others, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, 
vendors, and partners. Work-from-home and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and 
have affected the way we conduct our product development, validation, and qualification, customer support, and other activities, which 
could have a material adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks 
posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform 
critical functions.Table of Contents

Demand and macroeconomic risks . The pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It has caused a 
significant contraction in the global economy, and there is considerable uncertainty as to the severity and duration of the contraction. 
Risks related to adverse changes in global economic conditions are described in our risk factor titled “Global or regional conditions can 
harm our financial results,” and include the risk that demand for our products will be significantly harmed. During the second half of 2020 
in particular, we saw negative COVID-related demand trends in several areas of our data-centric businesses, as well as COVID-related 
changes in product mix that drove lower ASPs in our PC-centric business, as discussed in MD&A. Given the continued and substantial 
economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on demand for our 
products. For example, the increased demand for notebook products as a result of work- and learn-from-home dynamics may not 
continue as the pandemic progresses, or demand mix shifts that have been pronounced during the pandemic and have negatively 
impacted our ASPs could continue, such as the mix shift from desktop to notebook products in our CCG business and the mix shift from 
the enterprise and government market segment to the cloud service provider market segment in DCG.
Liquidity risks . The pandemic has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. Unanticipated 
consequences of the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.
Other risks.  The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section and throughout this report, 
which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us. Developments related to COVID-19 have been unpredictable, and additional 
impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or able to respond to appropriately. 
We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.
Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results.  We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations 
in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the 
U.S. accounted for 79% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020, with revenue from billings to China, including Hong 
Kong, contributing 26% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, 
assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of 
global and regional factors outside of our control. 
Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth, changes or 
uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses 
including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending. The COVID-19 pandemic has 
caused a significant contraction in the global economy, and there is considerable uncertainty as to its severity and duration . Adverse 
changes in economic conditions, including those related to the pandemic, can significantly harm demand for our products and make it 
more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our 
business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs 
or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial 
institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.
We can be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:
▪geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and 
terrorist activity, including, for example, geopolitical tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters 
and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;
▪natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic) , and other catastrophic events;
▪inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of 
services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;
▪formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and 
changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;
▪government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from 
a particular country;
▪adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives 
provided to competitors;
▪differing employment practices and labor issues;
▪ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;
▪local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;
▪continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including as a result 
of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union; and
▪fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit 
deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 59
We are also subject to risks related to uncertainty regarding LIBOR. Certain of our interest rate derivatives and investments are based on 
LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR. LIBOR is the subject of 
recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely after 
2021 or to perform differently than in the past. While we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to the 
2021 target date or that the 2021 cessation date may be extended, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these 
developments, and they could include an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest income.
We are subject to risks related to trade policies and regulations. Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade 
barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce 
demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or 
slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade 
policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our 
products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. 
In particular, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to 
some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. The U.S. has imposed restrictions on the export of U.S.-regulated 
products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced 
our sales, and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance, result in reputational harm to us due to 
our relationship with such companies, or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is 
difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, which may include trade restrictions and additional or 
increased tariffs and export controls imposed on short notice, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such 
actions. 
Trade disputes and protectionist measures, or continued uncertainty about such matters, could result in declining consumer confidence 
and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with 
us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, and decoupling of 
global trade networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.
Laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business.  We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among 
jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export 
requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; 
advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such 
requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable 
developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology may limit global adoption, 
impede our strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation 
and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and 
services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those 
workloads. 
Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance 
that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can 
result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to 
our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to 
government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.
We are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency 
exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of 
the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a 
weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital 
expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to 
offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can 
harm our results of operations and financial condition. 
Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.  Our operations and business, and those of 
our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues (including the COVID-19 
pandemic); cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; 
manufacturing equipment failures; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our 
manufacturing processes as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or 
components, including due to cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities 
are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result in certain natural disasters 
occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the 
availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semi-arid regions. During 2020, the west coast of the 
U.S. experienced historic wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities. The long-term effects of climate 
change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear, but could be severe. Table of Contents
Other Key Information 60
Catastrophic events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials 
from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and 
expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we 
cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover 
quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may experience reduced 
or cancelled orders or disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations.
We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we 
obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and 
broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by 
insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
Damage to our reputation can damage our business.  Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, 
governments, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise 
to reputational risk, including those described throughout this Risk Factors section, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. 
Our reputation can be impacted by catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic); incidents involving unethical 
behavior or misconduct; product quality, security, or safety issues; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal control failures; corporate 
governance issues; data breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; the use of our products for illegal or objectionable 
applications, including AI and machine learning applications that present ethical, regulatory, or other issues; marketing practices; media 
statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues or incidents that, whether actual or perceived, result in 
adverse publicity. To the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate crises, the ensuing negative public reaction 
could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us 
to regulatory actions or restrictions. 
Damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating environment. It could 
reduce investor confidence in us, adversely affecting our stock price. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when 
competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.
We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.
We face risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.  We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the 
Internet, or to introduce malicious software, to our IT systems. Individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored 
organizations, insider threats including employees and third-party service providers, or intruders into our physical facilities, at times 
attempt to gain unauthorized access and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our 
associated software and services. Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and 
organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. 
We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our suppliers, 
customers, or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, suppliers, and customers; interrupt 
our systems and services or those of our suppliers, customers, or others; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and 
services. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the affected parties to 
risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations, including our manufacturing 
operations. Our IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by third parties, and these providers can experience 
breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information.
From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure, as well as those 
of third parties who provide products and services to us. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, our Habana Labs subsidiary’s network 
was breached, resulting in unauthorized third-party access of certain confidential information, in connection with a suspected unsuccessful 
ransomware attack. The breach was confined to our subsidiary’s network and is not expected to have a material impact on Habana Labs’ 
business. We are also subject to risks associated with attacks involving our supply chain. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we became aware 
of reports that an update to widely used IT infrastructure management software provided by one of our vendors, SolarWinds Corporation, 
had been compromised by attackers, and we are investigating these reports. To date, cybersecurity incidents have not resulted in a 
material adverse impact to our business or operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact. Such 
incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, 
writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, 
defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to 
maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as reputational harm. In addition, 
these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate 
preventative measures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to our systems has increased 
significantly, which also increases our cybersecurity attack surface. We have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and 
sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces. We seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and 
attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal 
processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known 
or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of 
an incident or its magnitude and effects.Table of Contents

Theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our 
reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.  The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by 
us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. We 
anticipate that our collection of such personal data will increase as we enter into the MaaS market in our Mobileye business, and it may 
increase as we enter into other new or adjacent businesses. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are 
rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related 
and data protection measures could be significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our 
reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply 
with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or 
proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.
We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. 
We cannot always enforce or protect our IP rights.  We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to 
the success of our business. We rely on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, 
technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation 
risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. We are not always able to enforce or protect our 
IP rights. Enforcement is costly and time-consuming and can divert management attention. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may 
be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in 
another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations—
and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet 
standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive 
position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or 
unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and 
reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be 
reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees .
Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. 
Technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of 
our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of 
the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards 
organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard 
specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant 
licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the 
value of our IP rights may be impaired.
Third parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business.  We face claims based on IP 
rights from individuals and companies, including claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a 
new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other companies. Some of these claimants are funded by investment firms and have 
substantial resources, which can increase our defense costs. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners sometimes divest portions of their 
portfolios to more than one individual or company, increasing the number of parties who own IP rights previously all held by a single party. 
We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, 
regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and 
attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the 
alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in 
conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the 
cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights 
claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' 
businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.
As a result of IP rights claims, we could:
▪pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, or royalties;
▪stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims; 
▪need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or
▪enter into settlement or license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop 
production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 62
We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  Many of our products 
include third-party technology or implement industry standards and may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and 
industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance 
that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to 
license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact 
on our financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source 
software, we may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source 
licensing terms.
We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time,  we face legal claims or regulatory matters 
involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, and other issues on a global basis. As described in "Note 19: Commitments 
and Contingencies" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. 
Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an 
injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, 
such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial 
condition, and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-
consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, and distracting to management.
We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. 
Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business. The 
competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is increasingly intense. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire 
our employees. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit 
and hire technical and professional talent. Changes in the interpretation and application of employment-related laws to our workforce 
practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, 
retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. 
Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be 
viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as 
competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees would be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. 
Moreover, sustained declines in our stock price can reduce the retention value of our share-based awards. Changes in our management 
team can also disrupt our business. For example, we underwent several significant changes to our technical leadership during 2020 and 
announced the appointment of a new CEO in January 2021. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees, including 
in connection with these changes, could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, 
and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.
We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions.
Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our 
ongoing business, and adversely impact our results of operations.  Strategic transactions are an important component of our financial 
capital allocation strategy. We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other 
strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:
▪our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;
▪failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and of its anticipated benefits to materialize;
▪disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;
▪failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals at all 
or without materially burdensome conditions, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, 
or other unforeseen factors;
▪our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and 
restructuring charges;
▪our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired 
businesses;
▪our inability to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or our difficulty in integrating employees, business systems, and 
technology;
▪controls, processes, and procedures of acquired businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, 
and our failure to identify compliance issues or liabilities;
▪our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or 
assets; and
▪the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.
Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, 
particularly in the case of a large acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions. Moreover, our resources are limited and our decision to 
pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo the prospect of 
entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives. Table of Contents
Other Key Information 63
Where an existing investment does not meet our criteria for success, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and 
other options. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures, such as the pending divestiture of our NAND memory business 
to SK hynix, due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms; changes in market conditions or geopolitical conditions affecting the 
regions or industries in which we or counterparties operate; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals; limitations or 
restrictions due to regulatory or governmental approvals, litigation, contractual terms, or other conditions; delays in closing; lack of support 
by third parties; actions by competitors; adverse effects on our business relationships, operating results, or business due to the 
announcement and pendency of such transactions; and continued financial obligations, unanticipated liabilities, or transition costs 
associated with such transactions . In some cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all .
We invest in public and private companies and do not always realize a return on our investments.  We make investments in public and 
private companies around the world to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. 
Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with 
established revenue streams and business models. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time 
of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize a return on our 
investment in a private company, if any, is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or 
acquisition. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which can include failures to achieve business 
objectives as well as bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.
We are subject to sales-related risks. 
We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties.  We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties 
such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We 
depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to 
customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material 
change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our 
ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and 
stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end 
customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many 
risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties sell products that 
compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. 
From time to time, they face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and 
financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could 
have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce 
sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.
From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized "gray market." Gray market products can distort demand 
and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies, which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. 
Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products also sometimes 
include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be 
substandard.
We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers.  Collectively, our three largest customers accounted 
for 39% of our net revenue in 2020 and 41% of our net revenue in 2019. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account 
for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.
Industry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing 
power of certain customers, particularly cloud service providers, in some of our data-centric businesses. The cloud and cloud applications 
represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and 
consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization 
with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; 
product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product 
security and security features. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, and to the extent we do not execute 
effectively across these factors, our competitive position and market segment share may be adversely affected. 
Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including 
designs customized for their specific computing workloads. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, 
and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate 
workloads. During the second half of 2020, the mix shift in sales from enterprise and government market segment customers to cloud 
service providers contributed to lower ASPs in DCG. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud 
customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs. 
The loss of, or substantial reduction in sales to, one of our key customers, or their delays in orders for our products, can lead to a 
reduction in our revenue and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including 
customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.Table of Contents
Other Key Information 64
We face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign 
government entities associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are 
often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to U.S. government contracts, 
congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, 
administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, U.S. government 
contracts are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security, and failure to comply 
with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or 
debarment from future business with the U.S. government.
Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.
A number of factors can increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including: 
▪changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;
▪the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;
▪changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;
▪adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;
▪increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;
▪changes in available tax credits;
▪changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;
▪changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of 
manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income and expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD 
recommendations or other legislative actions;
▪changes in accounting standards; and
▪our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred 
upon repatriation.
We have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. 
We are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program, and the amount, timing, and execution of our 
repurchases fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business, including 
operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Changes in cash 
flows, tax laws and other laws, and the market price of our common stock can also limit or alter the amount and frequency of our stock 
repurchases. Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. For example, we suspended stock 
repurchases during a portion of 2020 due to uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that our 
stock repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Intel Corporation (the Company) as of December 26, 2020 and 
December 28, 2019, the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Stockholders' Equity for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements"). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position 
of the Company at December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), 
the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our 
report dated January 21, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our 
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or 
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was 
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to 
the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical 
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by 
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to 
which it relates.Table of Contents
Auditor's Reports 71
Inventory Valuation
Description of the 
MatterThe Company's net inventory totaled $8.4 billion as of December 26, 2020, representing 5.5% of total assets. 
As explained in "Note 2: Accounting Policies" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company 
computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of 
products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to 
assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the 
products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the 
determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing 
overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost 
or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable 
quality. 
Auditing management’s assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the 
determination of lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory reserves is 
judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as 
customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain 
new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.
How We Addressed 
the Matter in Our 
AuditWe evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over the 
costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the calculation of lower of 
cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices, and the 
determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory.
Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product 
costs and selling prices, and product demand forecasts) and the underlying data used in management’s 
inventory valuation assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current 
industry and economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, 
including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory 
valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the 
changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), 
the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and our report dated January 21, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion 
thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our 
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 : Basis of Presentation
We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 were 52-week fiscal 
years. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel and our subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany 
accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that 
affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The inputs into our judgments and 
estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19 on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The actual results that we 
experience may differ materially from our estimates.
Note 2 : Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or 
services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. In accordance with contract terms, revenue for 
product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the 
agreed upon shipping terms. 
We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable 
consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists 
primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer 
based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable 
balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued 
liabilities.
We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We 
generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct 
service, which we record as expense when the marketing activities occur.
Inventories
We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive 
engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities 
and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory. 
For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous 
technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to 
manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ has previously valued inventory up to $870 million in the 
quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the 
period incurred.
The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal 
capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loadings compared to our total available capacity in 
a statistical model to determine our normal capacity level. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion 
of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as cost of sales in 
that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges are insignificant in the years presented. 
Charges in years prior to those presented have ranged up to $1.1 billion taken in connection with the 2009 economic recession.
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of 
the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net 
realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies with costs improving over time due to scale and 
improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing 
environment.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 79
The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of salable quality. 
We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build 
decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate 
of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. 
When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we 
write off amounts considered to be excess inventory. 
Property, Plant and Equipment
We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings 
related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that 
asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.
We evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors 
such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of 
machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory 
planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, 
primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of 
assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.
Assets are "grouped" and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding 
when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, 
significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an 
asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be 
impaired. 
Fair Value
When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions 
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, grants receivable, 
and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our 
issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.
The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: 
▪Level 1 . Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining 
whether a market is active.
▪Level 2.  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active 
markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or 
can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
We use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant 
inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted 
for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices 
for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.
▪Level 3.  Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or 
liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are 
reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus 
prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.
Debt Investments
We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash 
equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and 
reverse repurchase agreements.
Marketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a 
related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk 
from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising 
from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains 
on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 80
Marketable debt investments are considered available-for-sale investments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not 
hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. Available-for-sale debt 
investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash 
equivalents. Available-for-sale debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months 
and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt investments with 
remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Available-for-sale debt investments are reported at 
fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost 
of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level, and record the interest income and realized gains or 
losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.
Our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we 
determine whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and 
reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the 
unrealized loss when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required 
or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are 
recognized in interest and other, net, and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income 
(loss).
Equity Investments
We regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments 
are measured and recorded as follows: 
▪Marketable equity securities  are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with 
changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement. 
▪Non-marketable equity securities  are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement 
alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable 
price changes.
▪Equity method investments  are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise 
significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity 
method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a 
one-quarter lag.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains 
(losses) on equity investments, net. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price 
changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an 
observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. 
Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes 
requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of 
estimates. 
Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also 
subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may 
have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include the investee's financial condition and business 
outlook, industry and sector performance, market for technology, operational and financing cash flow activities, and other relevant events 
and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-
marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment and the use of estimates, including 
discount rates, investee revenue and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. 
▪Non-marketable equity securities  are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and long-
lived assets. Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value 
and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
▪Equity method investments  are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which 
considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient 
period of time to allow for recovery. 
Impairments of equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 81
Derivative Financial Instruments
Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a 
lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in 
derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security 
arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments 
fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value 
amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related 
collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other 
accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.
Cash flow hedges  use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for 
variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital 
purchases spending.
The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects 
earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign 
currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are 
recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow 
hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would 
be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in 
the same section as the underlying item.
Fair value hedges  use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our 
fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the 
offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are 
recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from financing activities.
Non-designated hedges  use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized 
monetary assets and liabilities, non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and non-U.S.-dollar-
denominated loans receivables recognized at fair value. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our U.S.-
dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt instruments classified as trading assets. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded 
through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in 
interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally 
offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. 
Loans Receivable
We elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the 
loan with a related derivative instrument. When the fair value option is not elected, the loans are carried at amortized cost. We measure 
interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated 
coupon rate. We classify our loans within other current and long-term assets. 
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, 
derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade receivables. We generally place investments 
with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our 
analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt 
instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to 
those for other investments. 
We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions 
with the same counterparty. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are 
generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of 
December 26, 2020, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in U.S. treasury and 
U.S. agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $2.0 billion. 
To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and 
secure collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash 
collateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other 
accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the 
collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 82
A substantial majority  of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived 
from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the 
net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers (43% as of December 26, 2020) do not represent a significant credit 
risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. 
We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are 
moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this 
analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, 
such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.
Business Combinations
We allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their 
estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in 
determining the fair value of the following:
▪intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, 
and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;
▪deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the 
acquisition date; 
▪inventory; property, plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; deferred revenue; and contingent consideration, each 
as may be applicable; and
▪goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired 
and the liabilities assumed.
Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the 
management of the acquired companies. We allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the 
business combination.
Goodwill
We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently 
if indicators of potential impairment exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an 
impairment. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, 
excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. 
Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors 
affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative 
factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.
Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. 
Significant estimates include market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated costs, and discount rates 
based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital.
We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. In the current 
year, the fair value for all of our reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not 
indicate that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary. 
Identified Intangible Assets
We amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life. Acquisition-related in-
process R&D assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of 
acquisition; initially, these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, 
the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to amortization from 
this point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D.
We perform a quarterly review of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as 
industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. 
Employee Equity Incentive Plans
We use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net 
of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we 
eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if 
each vesting period were a separate award.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 83
Income Taxes
We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets 
and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently 
enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. 
We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for 
taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe 
that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recovery of a portion of our 
deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such 
changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.
We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that 
the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such 
positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred 
income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-U.S. earnings or for 
outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. 
Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and 
investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment 
needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which could be subject to applicable 
non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. 
Leases
Leases primarily consist of real property, and, to a lesser extent, certain machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options 
to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease 
components, and the non-lease components are accounted for separately and not included in our leased assets and corresponding 
liabilities. Payments on leases may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.
Loss Contingencies
We are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related 
to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that 
arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable 
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Note 3 : Operating Segments
We manage our business through the following operating segments:
▪DCG
▪IOTG
▪Mobileye
▪NSG
▪PSG
▪CCG
We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products, which are our principal products and considered as one class of 
product. We offer platform products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a 
stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, based on Intel architecture. Platform products are used in various form factors across our DCG, 
IOTG, and CCG operating segments. Our non-platform, or adjacent, products can be combined with platform products to form 
comprehensive platform solutions to meet customer needs.
DCG and CCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG, Mobileye, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify 
as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. Our 
Internet of Things portfolio, presented as Internet of Things, is comprised of the IOTG and Mobileye operating segments. Beginning with 
the first quarter of 2021, we expect our DCG operating segment to include the results of our Intel Optane memory business, and our NSG 
segment will be composed of our NAND memory business.
We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally 
allocated to the operating segments.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 84
We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
▪results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented; 
▪historical results of operations from divested businesses; 
▪results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business; 
▪amounts included within restructuring and other charges; 
▪a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and 
▪acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. 
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about 
the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset 
information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing 
and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is 
included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. 
Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense 
included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment 
revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. 
Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other 
segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.

In 2020, our three largest customers accounted for 39% of our net revenue (41% in 2019 and 39% in 2018), with Dell Inc. accounting 
for 17% (17% in 2019 and 16% in 2018), Lenovo Group Limited accounting for 12% (13% in 2019 and 12% in 2018), and HP Inc. 
accounting for 10% (11% in 2019 and 11% in 2018). These three customers accounted for 43% of our accounts receivable as 
of December 26, 2020 (39% as of December 28, 2019). Substantially all of the revenue from these customers was from the sale of 
platforms and other components by the CCG and DCG operating segments.

We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock 
outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock 
from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock 
options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the 2006 ESPP. In January 2020, 
we fully redeemed the remaining principal of our 2009 Debentures. We included our 2009 Debentures in the calculation of diluted 
earnings per share of common stock in 2019 and 2018 by applying the treasury stock method because the average market price was 
above the conversion price.
Securities that would have been anti-dilutive are insignificant and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in all 
periods presented.Table of Contents

Other  1.8  0.7  (0.2) 
Effective tax rate  16.7 %  12.5 %  9.7 %
Our effective tax rate increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with 
respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of our planned divestiture of the NAND memory business. It also increased due to  
the reduction in our foreign derived intangible income benefit in 2020.
Our effective tax rate increased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by one-time benefits that occurred in 2018.
We derive the effective tax rate benefit attributed to non-U.S. income taxed at different rates primarily from our operations in China, Hong 
Kong, Ireland, and Israel. The statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5% to 25.0%. In addition, we are subject to reduced 
tax rates in China and Israel as long as we conduct certain eligible activities and make certain capital investments. These conditional 
reduced tax rates expire at various dates through 2035 and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration.Table of Contents

Deferred and Current Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at 
the end of each period were as follows:
(In Millions) Dec 26, 2020 Dec 28, 2019

Deferred tax assets are included within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The valuation allowance as of December 26, 2020 included allowances primarily related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of $1.8 
billion.
As of December 26, 2020, our federal and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $345 million and $826 
million, respectively. Most of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-U.S. and U.S. 
federal net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2040. A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards 
in the U.S. relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. The non-U.S. net 
operating loss carryforwards include $772 million that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation allowance.
At December 26, 2020, we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $19.0 billion that we have 
indefinitely invested, and on which we have not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of potential tax is not practicable 
because of the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.
Current income taxes receivable of $131 million as of December 26, 2020 ($76 million as of December 28, 2019) are included in other 
current assets. Current income taxes payable of $756 million as of December 26, 2020 ($575 million as of December 28, 2019) are 
included in other accrued liabilities.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 90
Long-term income taxes payable of $4.6 billion as of December 26, 2020 ($4.9 billion as of December 28, 2019) is primarily comprised of 
the transition tax from Tax Reform, which is payable over eight years beginning in 2018, as well as amounts for uncertain tax positions, 
reduced by the associated deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits.

If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $550 million as 
of December 26, 2020 ($454 million as of December 28, 2019) and a reduction in the effective tax rate. Interest, penalties, and accrued 
interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.
We comply with the tax laws, regulations, and filing requirements of all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We regularly engage in 
discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although the timing of the resolutions and/
or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded 
within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the 
unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2020 could decrease by as much as $430 million in the next 12 months. 
We file federal, state, and non-U.S. tax returns. Excluding pre-acquisition Altera tax years, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal and 
non-U.S. tax examinations for years prior to 2010. For U.S. state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 
2012.

Upon Micron's notice of intent to exercise its right to call our interest in IMFT, we recognized an impairment charge of $290 million related 
to our investment in the third quarter of 2018. In 2019, Micron exercised its right and we sold our non-controlling interest in IMFT to 
Micron. We received $1.7 billion in sales proceeds and certain other repayments from Micron during 2019 and reported a gain of $107 
million. We continue to purchase products manufactured by Micron at the IMFT facility under our supply agreement, which includes the 
next generation of 3D XPoint technology.
McAfee
McAfee completed its initial public offering in October 2020. Due to our 40% ownership and significant influence as of December 26,

Acquisitions
We completed six acquisitions in 2020 and five acquisitions in 2019, all of which qualified as business combinations. The consideration for 
the acquisitions in 2020 and 2019 primarily consisted of cash and was allocated to goodwill and identified intangible assets. For

Moovit
On May 4, 2020, we acquired Moovit, a MaaS solutions company, for total consideration of $915 million. The fair values of the assets 
acquired relate to goodwill of $638 million and intangible assets of $331 million. The goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributed to 
the expected synergies and other benefits that will be generated from the combination of Intel and Moovit. We expect substantially all of 
the goodwill will not be deductible for local tax purposes. The acquisition-related intangible assets are primarily related to Moovit's monthly 
active user base and application platform. The goodwill and operating results of Moovit are included in our Mobileye operating segment.
Habana Labs
On December 12, 2019, we acquired Habana Labs, an Israel-based developer of programmable deep learning accelerators targeting AI 
workloads in the data center, for total consideration of $1.7 billion. Habana Labs strengthens our AI portfolio and accelerates our efforts to 
capitalize on the nascent, fast-growing AI silicon market opportunity. The fair values of the assets acquired relate to goodwill of $1.5 billion 
and acquisition-related intangible assets of $250 million. The goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributed to the expected synergies 
and other benefits that will be generated from the combination of Intel and Habana Labs. We expect substantially all of the goodwill will 
not be deductible for tax purposes. The acquisition-related intangible assets are primarily related to in-process R&D. The goodwill and 
operating results of Habana Labs are included in our DCG operating segment.
Divestitures
NAND Memory Business
On October 19, 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business, including our NAND 
memory fabrication facility in Dalian, China and certain related equipment and tangible assets (the Fab Assets), our NAND SSD business 
(the NAND SSD Business), and our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business). Our Intel 
Optane memory business is expressly excluded from the transaction. The transaction will occur over two closings for total consideration of 
$9.0 billion in cash, of which $7.0 billion will be received upon initial closing, not to occur prior to November 1, 2021, and the remaining 
$2.0 billion will be received no earlier than March 2025. The consummations of the first closing and the second closing are subject to 
customary conditions, including the receipt of certain governmental approvals.
At the first closing, Intel will sell to SK hynix the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business, and SK hynix will assume from Intel certain 
liabilities related to the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business. In connection with the first closing, we and certain affiliates of SK hynix 
will also enter into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to SK hynix NAND 
memory wafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, China, until the second closing.
We will transfer certain employees, IP, and other assets related to the NAND OpCo Business to separately created, wholly owned 
subsidiaries of Intel at the first closing. The equity interest of these wholly owned subsidiaries will transfer to SK hynix at the second 
closing. We have concluded based on the terms of the transaction agreements that the subsidiaries will be variable interest entities for 
which we are not the primary beneficiary, and accordingly will deconsolidate at the first closing. 
The carrying amounts of the major classes of NAND assets held for sale included the following:

Additional capital purchases of approximately $1.8 billion expected prior to first close will be classified as assets held for sale in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet and within additions to held for sale NAND property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Statement of 
Cash Flows.
Home Gateway Platform Division
On July 31, 2020, we completed the divestiture of the majority of Home Gateway Platform, a division of CCG, for proceeds of $150 
million. The divestiture included the transfer of certain employees, equipment, and an ongoing supply agreement for future units.
Smartphone Modem Business
On December 2, 2019, we completed the divestiture of the majority of our smartphone modem business, including certain employees, IP, 
equipment, and leases. Net assets sold were $267 million. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $690 million on the divestiture. 
Wind River
During the second quarter of 2018, we completed the divestiture of Wind River and recognized a pre-tax gain of $494 million.Table of Contents

1To manage foreign currency risk associated with the Australian-dollar-denominated notes issued in 2015, we entered into currency interest rate 
swaps which had an aggregate outstanding notional amount of $396 million at December 26, 2020, which effectively converted these notes to U.S.-
dollar-denominated notes. For further discussion on our currency interest rate swaps, see "Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments." Principal and 
unamortized discount/issuance costs for the Australian-dollar-denominated notes in the table above were calculated using foreign currency 
exchange rates as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019.Table of Contents

Senior Notes
In 2020, we issued a total of $10.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Net proceeds from the offerings are being used for 
general corporate purposes, which may include refinancing outstanding debt, funding for working capital and capital expenditures, and 
repurchasing shares of our common stock. During 2020, we repaid $1.0 billion of our 1.85% senior notes that matured in May 2020 and 
$1.8 billion of our 2.45% senior notes that matured in July 2020. We also repaid $700 million in floating-rate senior notes that matured in 
May 2020.
In 2019, we issued a total of $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and redeemed our $915 million, 4.70% senior notes 
due December 2045.
Our floating-rate senior notes pay interest quarterly and our fixed-rate senior notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed-
rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under the 
notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank 
junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.
Oregon and Arizona Bonds
In 2019 , we received proceeds of $648 million in aggregate from the sale of the 2019 Arizona Bonds and the 2019 Oregon Bonds. The 
bonds are our unsecured general obligations in accordance with loan agreements we entered into with the Industrial Development 
Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission. The bonds mature in 2049 and 
carry an interest rate of 5.00%. The 2019 Arizona Bonds and the 2019 Oregon Bonds are subject to mandatory tender in June 2024 and 
March 2022, respectively, at which time we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate 
bonds until another fixed-rate period is selected or until their final maturity date.
Convertible Debentures
In 2009, we issued the 2009 Debentures, which were convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock and paid 
a fixed rate of interest semiannually. In 2019, we paid $1.5 billion to satisfy conversion obligations for $615 million in principal, resulting in 
a cumulative loss of $156 million in interest and other, net, and $1.0 billion as a reduction in stockholders' equity related to the conversion 
feature. In 2020, we paid $1.1 billion in cash to settle our remaining $372 million in principal, resulting in a loss of $109 million in interest 
and other, net and $750 million as a reduction in stockholders' equity related to the conversion feature. 
Debt Maturities
Our aggregate debt maturities, excluding commercial paper and drafts payable, based on outstanding principal as of December 26, 2020,

 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 98
Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current 
period. If an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, we 
classify these assets as Level 3. 
We classify non-marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity method investments as Level 3. Impairments recognized on 
these investments held as of December 26, 2020 were $272 million ($113 million held as of December 28, 2019 and $416 million held as 
of December 29, 2018).
Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method 
investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, reverse repurchase agreements with 
original maturities greater than three months, and issued debt. 
We classify the fair value of grants receivables as Level 2. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their 
carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 26, 2020 was $139 million (the aggregate carrying 
value of grants receivable and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as of December 28, 
2019 was $543 million).
We classify the fair value of issued debt (excluding commercial paper and drafts payable) as Level 2. The fair value of these instruments 
was $40.9 billion as of December 26, 2020 ($30.6 billion as of December 28, 2019).

During 2020 and 2019, we did not enter into any new pay-variable, receive-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the fair 
value attributable to benchmark interest rates related to our outstanding senior notes. In 2018, we entered into $7.1 billion of such swaps 
and designated them as fair value hedges. The total notional amount of these swaps was $12.0 billion as of December 26, 2020 and 
$12.0 billion as of December 28, 2019. In 2019, we unwound $7.1 billion of swaps, resulting in a $111 million gain to be amortized over 
the remaining life of the debt.

Note 17 : Retirement Benefit Plans
Defined Contribution Plans
We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the U.S. and 
certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred 
basis. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation 
plan for certain highly compensated employees. 
We expensed $398 million for matching contributions based on the amount of employee contributions under the U.S. qualified defined 
contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans in 2020. Prior to 2020, the contributions were discretionary and we expensed 
$379 million in 2019 and $372 million in 2018.
U.S. Retiree Medical Plan
Upon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible U.S. employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the U.S. Retiree Medical Plan. 
The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.
As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the projected benefit obligation was $741 million and $633 million, which used the 
discount rate of 2.4% and 3.3%. The December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 corresponding fair value of plan assets was $600 
million and $553 million.
The investment strategy for U.S. Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future 
benefit payments. The assets are invested solely in a tax-aware global equity portfolio, which is actively managed by an external 
investment manager. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. As of 
December 26, 2020, substantially all of the U.S. Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were 
measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs.
The estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows:

Postretirement Medical Benefits $ 37 $ 38 $ 39 $ 40 $ 41 $ 218 
Pension Benefit Plans
We provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly the U.S., Ireland, Israel, and Germany. A substantial 
majority of the plans' benefits have been frozen. Table of Contents

Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets for Pension Benefit Plans
The vested benefit obligation for a defined-benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee 
is currently entitled based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement.

4 All plans had accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets for all periods presented. 
Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. We use the 
corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger 
of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.

We establish the discount rate for each pension plan by analyzing current market long-term bond rates and matching the bond maturity 
with the average duration of the pension liabilities. 
We establish the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund 
asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate 
of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for 
each asset class.Table of Contents

Funding
Our practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and 
regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Funding for the U.S. Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary under 
applicable laws and regulations; additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate.
On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 61% funded as of December 26, 2020. The U.S. Pension Plan, which 
accounts for 31% of the worldwide pension and retiree medical benefit obligations, was 89% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our 
ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for U.S. retirement plans is 
determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the U.S. Pension Plan 
currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost
The net periodic benefit cost for pension and U.S. retiree medical benefits was $164 million in 2020 ($135 million in 2019 and $197 million 
in 2018).

U.S. Plan Assets
The investment strategy for U.S. Pension Plan assets is to manage the funded status volatility, taking into consideration the investment 
horizon and expected volatility to help ensure that sufficient assets are available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation 
to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when 
outside the target ranges, which are approximately 90% fixed income and 10% equity investments. During 2020, the U.S. Pension Plan 
assets were invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value. 
Non-U.S. Plan Assets
The investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with 
regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within 
the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard 
contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to 
set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through 
index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, 
asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help ensure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as 
they come due. The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over was approximately 45% fixed income, 35% 
equity, and 20% hedge fund investments in 2020.
The equity investments in the non-U.S. plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., 
and emerging markets throughout the world.
We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in 
hedge funds, bond index funds, and equity index funds.

Note 18 : Employee Equity Incentive Plans
Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder 
and employee interests. Our plans include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP.
Under the 2006 Plan, 866 million shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-
employee directors through June 2023. As of December 26, 2020, 193 million shares of common stock remained available for future 
grants.
Under the 2006 Plan, we grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market condition, 
performance condition, and a service condition, which we call PSUs. Prior to 2019, we granted OSUs, which were RSUs with only market 
and service conditions. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and employees. For PSUs granted in 2020, the number of shares 
of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount, equally based on two metrics: our 
three-year cumulative non-GAAP EPS growth relative to a target rate and TSR of our common stock measured against the benchmark 
TSR of the S&P 500 IT Sector Index over a three-year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this 
performance period. As of December 26, 2020, 12 million PSUs and OSUs were outstanding. PSUs vest three years from the grant date, 
and OSUs, which were granted prior to 2019, generally vest three years and one month from the grant date. Other RSU awards and 
option awards generally vest over four years from the grant date. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. 
Share-Based Compensation
Share-based compensation recognized in 2020 was $1.9 billion ($1.7 billion in 2019 and $1.5 billion in 2018). During 2020, the tax benefit 
that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $380 million ($359 million in 2019 and $399 million in 2018).
We estimate the fair value of RSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on the date of 
grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair 
value of RSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical volatility. 
Restricted Stock Units
Weighted average assumptions used in estimating grant values were as follows:
Dec 26, 2020 Dec 28, 2019 Dec 29, 2018
Estimated values $ 54.82 $ 48.06 $ 48.95 
Risk-free interest rate  0.4 %  2.3 %  2.4 %

Forfeited  (8.5) $ 47.89 
December 26, 2020  82.7 $ 50.14 
Expected to vest  76.7 $ 50.06 
The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2020 was $1.9 billion ($1.9 billion in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018), which represents the 
market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2020 was $1.3 
billion ($1.3 billion in 2019 and $1.2 billion in 2018). The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on 
behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net of estimated 
future forfeitures.
As of December 26, 2020, unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $2.4 billion. 
We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.
Stock Purchase Plan
The 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific 
dates. Under the 2006 ESPP, 523 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2026. As of December 26, 
2020, 249 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 105
Employees purchased 21 million shares of common stock in 2020 for $876 million under the 2006 ESPP (17 million shares of common 
stock for $688 million in 2019 and 14 million shares of common stock for $468 million in 2018). As of December 26, 2020, unrecognized 
share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled $48 million. We 
expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months.
Note 19 : Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
We recognized leased assets in other long-term assets of $604 million and corresponding accrued liabilities of $173 million, and other 
long-term liabilities of $354 million as of December 26, 2020. Our leases have remaining terms of 1 to 15 years and may include options 
to extend the leases for up to 38 years. The weighted average remaining lease term was 4.5 years, and the weighted average discount 
rate was 2.5% as of December 26, 2020. 
Lease expense was $416 million in 2020 ($185 million in 2019 and $231 million in 2018), including $237 million in variable lease expense 
in 2020. Discounted and undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases as of December 26, 2020, excluding non-lease 
components, were as follows:

Commitments
Commitments for construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment totaled $8.6 billion as of December 26, 2020 ($10.9 billion as 
of December 28, 2019), a substantial majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and 
commitments totaled approximately $2.6 billion as of December 26, 2020 (approximately $2.8 billion as of December 28, 2019). Other 
purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or 
services. 
Legal Proceedings
We are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Although management at present believes that the 
ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of 
operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, 
and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in 
matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order 
prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other 
remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and 
overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and 
customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded 
that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.
European Commission Competition Matter
In 2001, the EC commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business 
practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the 
EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that 
Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision 
finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC 
found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged "conditional rebates and payments" 
that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by 
making alleged "payments to prevent sales of specific rival products." The EC imposed a fine in the amount of €1.1 billion ($1.4 billion as 
of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to "immediately bring to an end the 
infringement referred to in" the EC decision.
The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated 
that we should "cease and desist" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are 
subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the 
decision and to explain changes to our business practices.
We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our 
appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with 
the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of 
Intel's grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a 
rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General Wahl, an advisor to the 
Court of Justice, issued a non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision 
in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether 
the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court has appointed a panel of five judges to consider our Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 106
appeal of the EC's 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice’s clarifications of the law. In November 2017, the parties filed initial 
"Observations" about the Court of Justice's decision and the appeal and were invited by the General Court to offer supplemental 
comments to each other's "Observations," which the parties submitted in March 2018. Responses to other questions posed by the 
General Court were filed in May and June 2018. The General Court heard oral argument in March 2020. Pending the final decision in this 
matter, the fine paid by Intel has been placed by the EC in commercial bank accounts where it accrues interest.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly 
referred to as "Spectre" and "Meltdown") that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings 
like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate 
software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly 
reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. 
Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel and, in certain cases, our current and former executives and directors, in U.S. federal and 
state courts and in certain courts in other countries relating to the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, as well as other variants 
of these vulnerabilities that have since been identified.
As of January 20, 2021, consumer class action lawsuits relating to the above class of security vulnerabilities publicly disclosed since 2018 
were pending in the U.S., Canada, and Israel. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, 
generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety 
of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the U.S., numerous individual class action suits 
filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated in April 2018 for all pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. 
In March 2020, the court granted Intel's motion to dismiss the complaint in that consolidated action but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. 
Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in May 2020, which Intel moved to dismiss in July 2020; argument on the motion was heard in 
December 2020. In Canada, in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, an initial status conference has not yet been 
scheduled. In a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec, the court has stayed the case until January 2021. In 
Israel, two consumer class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court of Haifa. In the first case, the District Court denied the parties' 
joint motion to stay filed in January 2019, but to date has deferred Intel's deadline to respond to the complaint. Intel filed a motion to stay 
the second case pending resolution of the consolidated proceeding in the U.S., and a hearing on that motion has been scheduled for 
November 2020. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the 
pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those 
cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty 
exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are 
significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if 
any, that might arise from those matters.
In addition to these lawsuits, Intel stockholders filed multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits since January 2018 against certain current 
and former members of our Board of Directors and certain current and former officers, alleging that the defendants breached their duties 
to Intel in connection with the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities and the failure to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. 
The complaints sought to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. Some of the derivative actions were filed in the U.S. 
District Court for the Northern District of California and were consolidated, and the others were filed in the Superior Court of the State of 
California in San Mateo County and were consolidated. The federal court granted defendants' motion to dismiss in August 2018 on the 
ground that plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to show they were excused from making a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. The 
federal court granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, but subsequently dismissed the cases in January 2019 at plaintiffs' request. 
The California Superior Court entered judgment in defendants' favor in August 2020 after granting defendants' motions to dismiss 
plaintiffs' consolidated complaint and three successive amended complaints, all for failure to plead facts sufficient to show plaintiffs were 
excused from making pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the California court's judgment in October 
2020. In January 2021, another Intel stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court in San Mateo County against certain 
current and former officers and members of our Board of Directors. The lawsuit asserts claims similar to those dismissed in August 2020, 
except that it alleges that the stockholder made a pre-lawsuit demand on our Board of Directors and that the demand was wrongfully 
refused. Defendants have not yet responded.
Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences v. Intel China, Ltd., et al.
In February 2018, the Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS) sued Intel China, Ltd., Dell China, Ltd. 
(Dell) and Beijing JingDong Century Information Technology, Ltd. (JD) for patent infringement in the Beijing High Court. IMECAS alleges 
that Intel Core processors infringe Chinese patent CN 102956457 ('457 Patent). The complaint demands an injunction and damages of at 
least RMB 200 million plus the cost of litigation. A trial date is not yet set. In March 2018, Dell tendered indemnity to Intel, which Intel 
granted in April 2018. JD also tendered indemnity to Intel, which Intel granted in October 2018. In March 2018, Intel filed an invalidation 
request on the '457 patent with the Chinese Patent Reexamination Board (PRB). The PRB held an oral hearing in September 2018 and in 
February 2019 upheld the validity of the challenged claims. In January 2020, Intel filed a second invalidation request on the '457 patent 
with the PRB, for which the PRB heard oral argument in July 2020 and in November 2020 held the challenged apparatus claims invalid. In 
December 2020, Intel filed a third invalidation request on the '457 patent with the PRB. In September 2018 and March 2019, Intel filed 
petitions with the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) requesting institution of inter partes  review (IPR) of U.S. Patent No. 
9,070,719, the U.S. counterpart to the '457 patent. The USPTO denied institution of Intel's petitions in March and October 2019, 
respectively. In April 2019, Intel filed a request for rehearing and a petition for a Precedential Opinion Panel (POP) in the USPTO to 
challenge the denial of its first IPR petition, and in November 2019 Intel filed a request for rehearing on the second IPR petition. In 
January 2020, the USPTO denied the POP petition on the first IPR petition. In June 2020, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board denied Intel's 
rehearing requests on both petitions.Table of Contents
 
 Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 107
In October 2019, IMECAS filed second and third lawsuits in the Beijing IP Court, alleging infringement of Chinese Patent No. CN 
102386226 ('226 Patent) based on the manufacturing and sale of Intel® Core i3 microprocessors. Defendants in the second case are 
Lenovo (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (Lenovo) and Beijing Jiayun Huitong Technology Development Co. Ltd. (BJHT). Defendants in the third case 
are Intel Corp., Intel China Co., Ltd., the Intel China Beijing Branch, Beijing Digital China Co., Ltd. (Digital China), and JD. Both complaints 
demand injunctions plus litigation costs and reserve the right to claim damages in unspecified amounts. No proceedings have occurred or 
are yet scheduled in these lawsuits. In December 2019, Lenovo tendered indemnity to Intel, which Intel granted in March 2020. In July 
2020, Intel filed two invalidation requests on the '226 patent with the Chinese PRB. The PRB heard oral argument in December 2020.
Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, the unspecified nature and extent of damages claimed by IMECAS, and 
uncertainty regarding the availability of injunctive relief under applicable law, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential 
loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. We dispute IMECAS's claims and intend to vigorously defend against them.
VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel 
In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California 
alleging infringement of eight patents acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). The patents, which originated at Freescale 
Semiconductor, Inc. and NXP B.V., are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,268,588; 7,675,806; 7,706,207; 7,709,303; 8,004,922; 8,020,014; 8,268,672; 
and 8,566,836. VLSI accuses various FPGA and processor products of infringement. VLSI estimated its damages to be as high as $7.1 
billion, and its complaint further sought enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest. In May, June, September, 
and October 2018, Intel filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of claims in all eight of the patents in-suit. The PTAB instituted 
review of six patents and denied institution on two patents. As a result of the institution decisions, the parties stipulated to stay the District 
Court action in March 2019. In December 2019 and February 2020, the PTAB found all claims of the '588 and '303 patents, and some 
claims of the '922 patent, to be unpatentable. The PTAB found the challenged claims of the '014, '672 and '207 patents to be patentable. 
Intel moved for a continuation of the stay in March 2020 as it appealed certain rulings by the PTAB. In June 2020, the District Court issued 
an order continuing the stay through August 2021 and setting trial for December 2022.
In June 2018, VLSI filed a second suit against Intel, in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement by various Intel 
processors of five additional patents acquired from NXP: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,212,663; 7,246,027; 7,247,552; 7,523,331; and 8,081,026. 
VLSI accused Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys' 
fees and costs, and interest. In March 2019, the District Court dismissed VLSI's claims for willful infringement as to all the patents-in-suit 
except the '027 patent, and also dismissed VLSI's allegations of indirect infringement as to the '633, '331, and '026 patents. In June 2019, 
Intel filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of claims in all five patents-in-suit. In January 2020, the District Court vacated the 
November 2020 trial date based on agreement of the parties; no trial date is currently set. In January and February 2020, the PTAB 
instituted review of the '552, '633, '331 and '026 patents and as a result, Intel moved for stay of the District Court proceedings. In May 
2020, the District Court stayed the case as to the '026 and '552 patents but allowed the case to proceed on the '027 and '331 patents. For 
these two patents, VLSI is seeking damages of approximately $4.13 billion plus enhanced damages for the '027 patent. VLSI is no longer 
asserting claims from the '633 patent. 
In March 2019, VLSI filed a third suit against Intel, also in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of six more 
patents acquired from NXP: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,366,522; 6,663,187; 7,292,485; 7,606,983; 7,725,759; and 7,793,025. In April 2019, VLSI 
voluntarily dismissed this Delaware case without prejudice. In April 2019, VLSI filed three new infringement suits against Intel in the U.S. 
District Court for the Western District of Texas (WDTX) accusing various Intel processors of infringement. The three suits collectively 
assert the same six patents from the voluntarily dismissed Delaware case plus two additional patents acquired from NXP, U.S. Patent 
Nos. 7,523,373 and 8,156,357. VLSI accuses Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, 
enhanced damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and interest. Specifically, VLSI is seeking damages of approximately $11 billion collectively 
in the Texas cases, plus enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement. In the first Texas case, VLSI is asserting the '373 and '759 
patents. (In December 2020, the court granted Intel summary judgment of non-infringement on the '357 patent.)  VLSI seeks 
approximately $2.5 billion plus enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement in that case. That case was originally scheduled for trial 
in November 2020, but the court has now moved trial to February 2021. In October and November 2019 and in February 2020, Intel filed 
IPR petitions on certain asserted claims across six of the patents-in-suit in WDTX. Between May and October 2020, the PTAB denied all 
of these requests, and Intel has requested a rehearing, as well as a review from the Precedential Opinion Panel (POP), as to all petitions. 
All requests for POP review were denied in October and December 2020, and in December 2020 requests for rehearing were denied as 
to petitions filed on the '373 and '759 patents.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) 
Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts Chinese Patent 201410094015.9 accusing certain Intel Core processors of 
infringement. VLSI requests an injunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in damages. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 
with the PRB, but no hearing date has been set. In May 2020, defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a 
determination on invalidity. The court has not yet ruled on the motion to stay. The court held the first evidentiary hearing in November 
2020.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a second case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) 
Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts Chinese Patent 201080024173.7. VLSI accuses certain Intel core 
processors and seeks an injunction. Defendants filed with the PRB an invalidation petition in October 2019. No hearing date has been set. 
In June 2020, defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court has not yet 
ruled on the motion to stay. The court held its first evidentiary hearing in September 2020. The Court held a second evidentiary hearing 
and trial in December 2020 and has not yet issued a ruling.Table of Contents

In November 2019, Intel, along with Apple Inc., filed a complaint against Fortress Investment Group LLC, Fortress Credit Co. LLC, Uniloc 
2017 LLC, Uniloc USA, Inc., Uniloc Luxembourg S.A.R.L., VLSI, INVT SPE LLC, Inventergy Global, Inc., DSS Technology Management, 
Inc., IXI IP, LLC, and Seven Networks, LLC. Plaintiffs allege violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act by certain defendants, Section 7 of 
the Clayton Act by certain defendants, and California Business and Professions Code section 17200 by all defendants based on 
defendants' unlawful aggregation of patents. In February 2020, defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint. In July 2020, the court 
granted defendants' motion to dismiss with leave to amend. The court dismissed antitrust claims related to two DSS patents with 
prejudice. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in August 2020, and defendants moved to dismiss in September 2020. The court 
heard defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint in December 2020 and granted the motion in January 2021, with leave to 
further amend .
In June 2020, affiliates controlled by Fortress Investment Group, which also controls VLSI, acquired Finjan Holdings, Inc. Intel had signed 
a "Settlement, Release and Patent License Agreement" with Finjan in 2012, acquiring a license to the patents of Finjan and its affiliates, 
current or future, through a capture period of November 20, 2022. The agreement also contains covenants wherein Finjan agrees to 
cause its affiliates to comply with the agreement. As such, Intel maintains that it now has a license to the patents of VLSI, which has 
become a Finjan affiliate, and that Finjan must cause VLSI to dismiss its suits against Intel. In August 2020, Intel started dispute resolution 
proceedings under the agreement. As a part of this dispute resolution process, Intel and Finjan held a mediation in December 2020, but 
failed to resolve their differences. Intel filed suit to enforce its rights under the License Agreement with Finjan in January 2021 in Delaware 
Chancery Court . In September 2020, Intel filed motions to stay the Texas, Delaware, and Shanghai matters pending resolution of its 
dispute with Finjan. In November 2020, Intel filed a motion to stay the Shenzhen matter pending resolution of its dispute with Finjan. In 
November 2020, the Delaware Court denied Intel's motion to stay. The other stay motions remain pending. Finally, Intel filed a motion to 
amend its answer in the Texas matters to add a license defense in November 2020. The Court has yet to rule on the motion.
Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are 
unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. We dispute VLSI's claims 
and intend to vigorously defend against them.
Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement
Starting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California 
against Intel and certain current and former officers based on Intel’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who 
purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 2019 and July 2020, generally allege that the defendants violated 
securities laws by making false and misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announced delays. 
In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a 
consolidated complaint. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural 
posture and the nature of these cases, including that the proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been 
specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if 
certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the 
potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters.
In addition to the securities lawsuits, several Intel stockholders have filed derivative lawsuits against certain members of our Board of 
Directors and certain current and former officers based on Intel’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The complaints, which 
were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in December 2020, allege that defendants breached their fiduciary 
duties to Intel by either making or allowing the company to make alleged misstatements about the timeline for 7nm products during the 
class period alleged in the securities litigation. Certain of the complaints also allege claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934. The complaints seek to recover damages on behalf of Intel. Defendants have not yet responded. Table of Contents

Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and 
procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how 
well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The 
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered 
relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute 
assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been 
detected.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our employees are working from home. Established business continuity plans 
remain activated to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data, and internal controls. The design of our 
processes and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of 
the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls 
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange 
Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under 
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is 
accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to 
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange 
Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 26, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, 
our internal control over financial reporting.
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and 
the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020. Management based its assessment on 
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (2013 framework). Management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating 
effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the 
fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial 
Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with 
the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the company's 
internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firm's attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and 
Supplemental Details. Table of Contents
