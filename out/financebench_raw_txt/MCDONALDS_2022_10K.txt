ABOUT  McDONALD'S
McDonald’ s Corporation, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the "Company ." The Company , its franchisees and suppliers are
referred to herein as the "System."
BUSINESS SUMMARY
GENERAL
For the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no material changes to the Company's corporate structure or in its method of conducting business. Refer to
the Segment and Geographic Information section on page 48 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
The Company franchises and operates McDonald’ s restaurants, which serve a locally relevant menu of quality food and beverages in communities across more
than 100 countries. Of the 40,275 McDonald's restaurants at year-end 2022 , approximately  95% were franchised.
The Company’ s reporting segments are aligned with its strategic priorities and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance.
Significant reportable segments include the United States ("U.S.") and International Operated Markets. In addition, there is the International Developmental
Licensed Markets & Corporate segment, which includes markets in over 80 countries, as well as Corporate activities.
McDonald’ s franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or
affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of
individuals with entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property
ownership and franchising. The business relationship between the Company and its independent franchisees is supported by adhering to standards and policies,
including McDonald's Global Brand Standards, and is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to protecting the McDonald’ s brand.
The Company is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally relevant customer experiences and
driving profitability . Franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters, marketing and pricing
decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonald’ s global brand, operating system and financial resources.
Directly operating McDonald’ s restaurants contributes significantly to the Company's ability to act as a credible franchisor . One of the strengths of the
franchising model is that the expertise from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonald’ s to improve the operations and success of all restaurants
while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, ef ficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated
restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated
restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, the Company is able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and
pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit McDonald’ s restaurants.
The Company’ s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Fees vary by type of site,
amount of Company investment, if any , and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license
agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The Company’ s Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred
by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the
McDonald’ s brand and, for periods prior to its sale on April 1, 2022, third-party revenues for the Company's Dynamic Yield business.
Conventional Franchise
Under a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for the restaurant location and
the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and décor . The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by
franchisees, enables it to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry .
Franchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the
Company may co-invest with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or operating systems. These investments, developed in collaboration with
franchisees, are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance and increase the value of the McDonald's brand through the
development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 3
The Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with
franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all McDonald’ s restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Company’ s revenue,
primarily through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the
opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. The Company's heavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable
revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales, and resulting cash flow streams.
Developmental License or Affiliate
Under a developmental license or af filiate arrangement, licensees are responsible for operating and managing their businesses, providing capital (including the
real estate interest) and developing and opening new restaurants. The Company generally does not invest any capital under a developmental license or af filiate
arrangement, and it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally receives initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new
license.
While developmental license and af filiate arrangements are largely the same, af filiate arrangements are used in a limited number of foreign markets
(primarily China and Japan) within the International Developmental Licensed Markets segment as well as a limited number of individual restaurants within the
International Operated Markets segment, where the Company also has an equity investment and records its share of net results in equity in earnings of
unconsolidated af filiates.
PURPOSE, MISSION AND VALUES
Through its size and scale, McDonald's embraces and prioritizes its role and commitment to the communities in which it operates through its purpose  to feed and
foster communities, and its mission  to make delicious feel-good moments for everyone. The Company is guided by five core values  that define who we are and
how we run our business across the three-legged stool of McDonald’ s franchisees, suppliers, and employees:
1.Serve  – We put our customers and people first;
2.Inclusion  – We open our doors to everyone;
3.Integrity  – We do the right thing;
4.Community  – We are good neighbors; and
5.Family  – We get better together .
The Company believes that its people, all around the world, set it apart and bring these values to life on a daily basis.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’ s people strategies aim to create an environment grounded in diversity , equity , and inclusion (“DEI”). To do this, the Company continues to
evaluate and evolve its compensation and benefits programs to remain locally relevant and competitive, while of fering quality training and learning opportunities,
and continues to uphold a high standard of health and safety for employees and customers alike.
You can find more information about the Company's human capital management and related initiatives in its “Purpose & Impact” report.
Our People
Company employees, which include those in the Company's corporate and other of fices as well as in Company-owned and operated restaurants, totaled over
150,000 worldwide as of year-end 2022, of which approximately 70% were based outside of the U.S. In addition to Company employees, the over two million
individuals who work in McDonald's franchised restaurants around the world are critical to the Company’ s success, enabling it to drive long-term value creation
and further its purpose and mission. People are at the cornerstone of the Company's business and an essential part of the System.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
The Company's aspiration is that no matter where you are in the world, when you interact with McDonald’ s, DEI is as evident and familiar as the Arches
themselves. A diverse workforce is and will continue to be critical to McDonald’ s success, and the Company is committed to making this a continued priority . The
Company adheres to a global DEI strategy designed to drive accountability across the System to better represent the diverse communities in which McDonald’ s
operates, to accelerate cultures of inclusion and belonging and to further dismantle barriers to economic opportunity .
The Company’ s DEI strategy reflects its commitment to deliver equitable treatment for all people and includes:
•ongoing ef forts to improve the representation of women and underrepresented groups at all levels of the Company;
•a franchisee recruitment initiative to increase the number of new franchisees from all backgrounds, including underrepresented groups, particularly for
those who may face socio-economic barriers to entry;
•best practice sharing with franchisees and suppliers to support them in furthering DEI progress within their own organizations;
•upholding human rights and cultivating a respectful workplace that is ethical, truthful and dependable; and
•a commitment to equal pay among Company employees with comparable job responsibilities, experience, performance and contributions, as well as
fair treatment in access, opportunity and advancement for all.
While McDonald’ s is proud of its more than 65-year history as an employer , its global DEI strategy is designed to facilitate continued growth in how the
Company approaches equitable opportunity and its role in catalyzing it across the System and beyond. The Company is committed to accelerating
representation, inclusion and opportunity for underrepresented groups, not only within the Company but across the System. This goal is underscored by the
Company's Mutual Commitment to Diversity , Equity and Inclusion, a pledge that invites the Company’ s U.S. based suppliers to commit to accountability for DEI
progress within their own organizations. Aligned with the Company's
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 4
purpose, mission and values, the Mutual Commitment draws on McDonald's size and scale and highlights its opportunity to accelerate meaningful change for
employees, franchisees, suppliers, customers and communities.
To reinforce the importance of the Company’ s values, the Company’ s incentive plan includes quantitative human capital metrics that hold executives
accountable for making progress on DEI goals. In addition to the Company’ s financial performance, executives are measured on quantitative metrics that include
championing the Company's core values, improving representation within leadership roles (Senior Director and above) and assessing feelings of inclusion within
the Company . In addition, in 2022, the Company introduced an owner/operator diversity metric into its incentive plan for certain key of ficers and managing
directors.
For more information on employee, Board and franchisee representation, as well as diverse-owned supplier spend and equal pay , see the Company's
Global Diversity , Equity , and Inclusion Report, including the Diversity Snapshot.
Respectful Workplace Environment
Fostering safe, inclusive and respectful workplaces, wherever McDonald's does business, has been integral to the Company for its more than 65-year history .
The Company understands the importance of providing a positive experience and making everyone feel valued, both in its of fices and in McDonald's restaurants.
The Company’ s commitment to human rights is set forth in its Human Rights Policy and is furthered by its Standards of Business Conduct, which apply to
Company employees, and its Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets forth human rights requirements for the Company's global suppliers. Company employees
are trained on and are required to annually certify their understanding of, and commitment to upholding, the Standards of Business Conduct.
Further , the Company’ s Global Brand Standards (which apply to all McDonald’ s restaurants, whether Company-owned or franchised) prioritize action in four
areas: harassment, discrimination, and retaliation prevention; workplace violence prevention; restaurant employee feedback; and health and safety . Beginning in
2022, the first full year in which the Global Brand Standards were in ef fect, all restaurants were assessed on the Global Brand Standards in accordance with the
applicable McDonald’ s market’ s business evaluation processes.
As part of its commitment to a respectful workplace environment, the Company recognizes how important it is to provide channels for its employees to
report human rights and similar concerns that may violate Company policies and standards. Employees can do so in many ways, including through an
anonymous global channel, the Business Integrity Line, which is staf fed by a live operator from an independent company and is available 24 hours a day , 365
days a year . This is complemented by additional reporting channels in many markets. The Company expects its employees and franchisees to uphold human
rights and cultivate respectful workplaces, which builds trust, protects the integrity of the McDonald's brand and fuels Systemwide success.
Compensation, Benefits, and Talent Development
The compensation and benefits provided to Company employees, including both corporate staf f and Company-owned restaurant employees, is established
based upon competitive considerations in the relevant labor market. The amount and type of compensation varies by an employee's level and location, and
typically includes some combination of the following (in addition to base pay): cash bonuses, stock-based awards, retirement savings programs, and health and
welfare benefits. Company employees may also receive paid time of f, family care resources, tuition assistance and flexible work schedules.
In 2021, the Company publicly communicated its ongoing commitment to equal pay , which is supported by an annual pay gap analysis that aims to ensure
equitable pay practices are consistently implemented and executed across the Company . Results of the 2022 pay gap analysis showed that women globally in
Company owned and operated markets were paid 99.91 cents on the dollar in base pay on average of what men were paid for similar work. Further , there was
no base pay gap disfavoring underrepresented groups in the U.S. These results indicate the Company substantially attained equal pay , and by the end of the
first quarter of 2023, intends to close the small gaps identified in line with the commitment to close pay gaps identified in annual equal pay analyses. In line with
its core values, the Company continuously emphasizes the importance of pay that is competitive, non-discriminatory , performance-based, transparent and
compliant with legal and regulatory standards.
Additionally , McDonald’ s has a long-standing commitment to providing training, education benefits and career path opportunities, which empower the people
and communities it serves. Learning and development is a competitive advantage to McDonald’ s and a true dif ferentiator to its employee value proposition.
McDonald’ s Hamburger University has eight campuses around the world, as well as online and on-demand resources, that provide training for Company
employees as well as franchisees and their eligible employees. The Company is committed to providing opportunities for people to enhance their skills and fulfill
their potential through talent development programs, apprenticeship opportunities, language and technical skill training and support for continuing education, as
it believes this helps to facilitate talent attraction, career development and retention.
Communities
McDonald’ s embraces its role and commitment to the communities it serves. Through its Youth Opportunity program, the Company aims to reduce barriers to
employment for two million youth by 2025 through supporting pre-employment job readiness training, employment opportunities and workplace development
programs. The Company is also proud to support the network of over 260 local chapters of Ronald McDonald House Charities (“RMHC”) spanning over 60
countries and regions that creates, finds and supports programs that directly improve the health and well-being of children and their families. In 2020, the
Company announced a five-year , $100 million commitment to RMHC.
In addition, the Company maintains a Global Food Disposition Policy to help support its suppliers and distributors around the world in disposing of food in
alignment with McDonald’ s food waste hierarchy , including by enabling food donations wherever possible. The Policy , which aims to avoid food waste and loss
while also allowing the System to meet the needs of local communities, is a critical part of the Company's sustainability work and its purpose to feed and foster
communities.
The Company continues to bring its Community Impact strategy to life through enhanced support ef forts because its business thrives when communities
thrive. As a System, McDonald’ s creates opportunities that encourage Company employees, franchisees and their employees, suppliers and customers to get
involved in philanthropic and volunteering opportunities.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 5
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company prioritizes action and progress across a range of environmental matters, and endeavors to improve its long-term sustainability and resiliency ,
which benefit the System and the communities McDonald's serves. The Company monitors environmental regulations and stakeholder expectations in order to
be well-positioned to respond in a timely and appropriate manner , as it cannot predict the precise nature of how these matters will continue to evolve. Although
any impact would likely vary by geographic region and/or market, the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may increase costs and/or operational
complexity for the Company .
To guide its management of environmental matters and to strengthen its resiliency , the Company has developed goals and commitments that are informed
by relevant frameworks, including the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). These include initiatives to reduce Systemwide greenhouse
gas emissions, support deforestation free sourcing throughout the Company's global supply chain, ef ficiently manage natural resources and support biodiversity ,
responsibly source ingredients and packaging and increase the availability of recycling in restaurants to reduce waste. These are areas of increasing importance
to the Company and its stakeholders and where the Company believes it can have a significant impact and help to drive industry-wide change. In recent years,
the Company has made significant progress on many of its global goals and commitments. You can find more information about these initiatives, as well as other
environmental sustainability matters, in the Company's “Our Purpose & Impact” report. Information can also be found in the Company's annual Climate Change,
Forests and W ater reports submitted to CDP , an organization that helps companies manage their environmental impacts.
The Company monitors and manages the evolving environmental landscape to further understand potential risks and opportunities for the business in
collaboration with expert partners. The Company believes taking action on environmental matters will drive long-term business value by ensuring that it is
managing operational costs in its energy supply , improving the security of its raw material supply , stewarding the environment in its surrounding communities and
reducing its exposure to increasing environmental risks, regulation and costs.
SUPPLY CHAIN, FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY
The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established
and enforces high food safety and quality standards and maintains quality centers around the world designed to promote consistency of these quality standards
and menu compliance. The quality management systems and processes involve ongoing product reviews, virtual supplier visits and third-party verifications. A
Food Safety Advisory Council, comprised of the Company’ s internal food safety experts as well as suppliers and outside academics, supports our food safety
risk management work and provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety and quality . The Company also has ongoing programs to elevate
food safety culture throughout the business by educating employees about food safety practices, including proper storage, handling and preparation of food for
customers, and conducting trainings for its suppliers and restaurant operators to share best practices on food safety and quality .
The Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation and drive continuous improvement across its global supply chain. Leveraging its scale,
supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company collaborates with suppliers on contingency planning to achieve continuous supply and
competitive, predictable costs over the long term. The Company also works closely with suppliers and other third-party experts to drive sustainable sourcing
initiatives, including the environmental matters discussed above and improving the health and welfare of the animals within its supply chain. Led by its Chief
Supply Chain Of ficer, the Company has developed and implemented a comprehensive strategy that its global supply chain organization leverages to identify ,
assess and manage risk in its supply chain.
To reinforce the importance of its values, the Company maintains a Supplier Code of Conduct that applies to all of its suppliers around the world. The
Company expects all of its suppliers to meet the rigorous standards set forth in the Code, which cover areas including human rights, workplace environment,
business integrity and environmental management. In addition, the Company has a comprehensive Supplier W orkplace Accountability (SW A) program to help
suppliers understand its expectations, verify compliance and work toward continuous improvement.

McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 6
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property , including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other
proprietary information. The Company considers the "McDonald's" trademark and the Golden Arches Logo to be of material importance to its business.
Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. The Company's patents, copyrights
and licenses are of varying durations.
COMPETITION
McDonald’ s restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of traditional, fast casual and other food service competitors. The
Company measures its competitive position within the informal eating out ("IEO") segment, which is inclusive of the Company's primary competition of quick-
service restaurants, but also includes 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, street stalls or kiosks, cafés, specialist cof fee shops, self-service cafeterias and
juice/smoothie bars. The Company competes among quick-service restaurants primarily on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety
and product quality .
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
The Company has global operations and is therefore subject to the laws of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and the rules
and regulations of various governing bodies, which may dif fer among jurisdictions. As discussed under “Legal Proceedings – Government Regulations” on page
33 of this Form 10-K, governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business, including, but not limited to,
advertising, franchising, health, safety , environment, competition, zoning, employment and taxation.
In addition, during the last three years, markets experienced varying levels of governmental restrictions on restaurant operations in response to the COVID-
19 pandemic, including restrictions related to operating hours, dine-in capacity , and dining room and restaurant closures. These restrictions af fected the
Company’ s revenues for all three years, with a more limited impact in 2022 due to the lesser extent of the restrictions.
While costs associated with legal and regulatory compliance have increased along with the number and scope of laws and regulations af fecting our
business, these costs are not expected to have a material ef fect on the Company’ s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 7
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESUL TS OF OPERA TIONS
MANAGEMENT'S VIEW OF THE BUSINESS
In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, some
of which are considered to be non-GAAP , including comparable sales and guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, after-tax return on invested capital from
continuing operations, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below . Management believes these measures are important in
understanding the financial performance of the Company .
•Constant currency results exclude the ef fects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average
exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the ef fect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other charges and
gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company
believes this better represents underlying business trends.
•Comparable sales and comparable guest counts  are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and transactions, respectively , at all
restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the
reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters and acts of war , terrorism
or other hostilities (including restaurants temporarily closed due to COVID-19, as well as those that remain closed in Ukraine). Restaurants in Russia were
treated as permanently closed as of April 1, 2022 and therefore excluded from the calculation of comparable sales and comparable guest counts beginning
in the second quarter of 2022. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyper-inflationary
(generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more
accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is
affected by changes in pricing and product mix.
•Systemwide sales  include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. This includes sales from digital channels, which are
comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk at both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as
revenues by the Company , management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales
are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The
Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees,
developmental licensees and af filiates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.
•The Company’ s after-tax return on invested capital ("ROIC")  from continuing operations is a metric that management believes measures capital-allocation
effectiveness over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC dif ferently , limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.
Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculation of ROIC.
•Free cash flow , defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate , defined as free cash flow divided by

menu and marketing promotions and continued digital and delivery growth.
•Comparable sales in the International Operated segment increased 13.3%, reflecting positive comparable sales across the segment, primarily driven by
France, Germany and the U.K.

tax audit in France and a gain on the sale of the Company's Dynamic Yield business. Additionally , 2021 results were impacted by gains on the Company's sale of
McDonald's Japan stock, the remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of a change in the U.K. statutory income tax rate and charges from the sale of McD
Tech Labs.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION
In early 2023, the Company announced an evolution of its successful Accelerating the Arches  strategy (the “Strategy”). The Strategy , which encompasses all
aspects of McDonald’ s business as the leading global omni-channel restaurant brand, continues to reflect the Company’ s purpose, mission and values.
Enhancements to the Strategy include the additions of Restaurant Development to the MCD growth pillars and an internal ef fort, Accelerating the Organization ,
both of which are aimed at elevating the Company’ s performance. The Company's guiding purpose, mission and values are discussed in a dedicated section on
page 4 of this Form 10-K.
GROWTH PILLARS
The following growth pillars, MCD, build on historic strengths and articulate areas of further opportunity . Under the Strategy , the Company will:
•Maximize our Marketing by investing in new , culturally relevant approaches, grounded in fan truths, to ef fectively communicate the story of our brand, food
and purpose. This is exemplified by campaigns that elevate the entire brand, such as the Famous Orders platform that has been repeatedly adopted by
markets across the globe, the FIF A World Cup campaign that debuted in 75 markets, the UK’ s Raise Your Arches campaign that was picked up by 30
markets around the globe and The Cactus Plant Flea Market Box in the U.S. The Company is committed to a marketing strategy that highlights value at
every tier of the menu, as af fordability remains a cornerstone of the McDonald’ s brand and is especially important to our customers in uncertain economic
environments.
•Commit to the Core  menu by tapping into customer demand for the familiar and focusing on serving our iconic products such as our W orld Famous Fries,
the Big Mac, our Chicken McNuggets and the McFlurry . Around the world, McDonald’ s possesses 10 of these "billion-dollar brand equities." The Company
will continue to improve on its classics by implementing a series of operational and formulation changes designed to deliver hotter , juicer , tastier burgers
across the globe. While leaning into core icons like Chicken McNuggets, ongoing focus will include scaling emerging equities such as the McSpicy and
McCrispy Chicken Sandwiches. The Company also continues to see a significant opportunity with cof fee, demonstrated by markets leveraging the McCafé
brand, customer experience, value and quality to drive long-term growth.
•Double Down on the 4D's: Digital, Delivery , Drive Thru and the recent addition of Restaurant Development  by leveraging competitive strengths and
building a powerful digital experience growth engine to deliver a personalized and convenient customer experience. To unlock further growth, the Company
expects to continue to accelerate the pace of restaurant openings and technology innovation so that whenever and however customers choose to interact
with McDonald’ s, they can enjoy a fast, easy experience that meets their needs. In 2022, digital channels (the mobile app, delivery and kiosk) comprised
nearly 35% of Systemwide sales in the Company’ s top six markets, representing over $25 billion in digital Systemwide sales.
◦Digital: The Company’ s digital experience growth engine — “MyMcDonald’ s” — is transforming its of ferings across drive thru, takeaway , delivery ,
curbside pick-up and dine-in with digital enhancements. Through the digital tools, customers can access personalized of fers, participate in a loyalty
program, order through the mobile app and receive McDonald's food through the channel of their choice. The Company has successful loyalty
programs in over 50 markets around the world, including its top six markets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’ s loyalty customers have
proven to be highly engaged, with nearly 50 million active loyalty members across the top six markets in the last 90 days, including 28 million in
the U.S.
◦Delivery:  The Company has continued to expand the number of restaurants of fering delivery to nearly 35,000, representing over 85% of
McDonald's restaurants. Delivery is available in about 100 markets, and the Company is continuing to build on and enhance the delivery
experience for customers by adding the ability to place a delivery order on the McDonald's mobile app in some of its largest markets. This
capability is now available in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and Australia. The Company has also put in place long-term strategic partnerships with
UberEats, DoorDash, Just Eat Takeaway .com and Deliveroo. These partnerships are expected to benefit the Company , its customers and
franchisees by optimizing operational ef ficiencies and creating a seamless customer experience.
◦Drive Thru: The Company has drive thru locations in over 26,000 restaurants globally , including nearly 95% of the over 13,000 locations in the
U.S. This channel remains a competitive advantage, and we expect that it will become even more critical to meeting customers’  demand for
flexibility and choice. The Company continues to build on its drive thru advantage, as the vast majority of new restaurant openings in the U.S. and
International Operated Market segments will include a drive thru.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 9
◦Restaurant Development:  The Company will accelerate the pace of restaurant openings with the recent addition of this component to the MCD
growth pillars. In 2023, the Company plans to open approximately 1,900 new restaurant units across the globe, which will contribute to nearly 4%
net unit growth. The Company believes there is opportunity for further growth in many of its largest markets and to explore new formats under the
McDonald’ s brand over the coming years.
FOUNDATION
Foundational to the Strategy is keeping the customer and restaurant crew at the center of everything we do, along with a relentless focus on running great
restaurants, empowering our people and modernizing ways of working through Accelerating the Organization .
•Running Great Restaurants:  The Company of fers the speed, choice and personalization that its customers expect and serves delicious food people
feel good about eating, with convenient locations and hours and af fordable prices.
•Empowering our People: The Company believes the employee experience is critical to its success and, in 2022, implemented Global Brand
Standards which are designed to create a culture of safety for both employees and customers in McDonald’ s restaurants around the world.
•Accelerating the Organization : The Company will unlock further growth as it modernizes the way it works by focusing on becoming faster , more
innovative and more ef ficient at solving problems for its customers and people. This work is guided by a commitment to provide people with career
paths for growth and development that capitalize on the global nature of the Company's business.
These ef forts, coupled with investments in innovation, are designed to enhance the customer experience and deliver long-term profitable growth for all
stakeholders. The Strategy is aligned with the Company’ s capital allocation philosophy of investing in opportunities to grow the business (through new
restaurants and reinvesting in existing restaurants) and returning free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.
The Company believes the Strategy builds on its inherent strengths by harnessing its competitive advantages while leveraging its size, scale and agility to adapt
and adjust to uncertain economic and operating environments to meet consumer demands. The Strategy is supported by a strong global senior leadership team
aimed at executing against the MCD growth pillars and accelerating the Company’ s broad-based business momentum.
OUTLOOK
Based on current conditions, the following is provided to assist in forecasting the Company's future results for 2023.
• The Company expects net restaurant unit expansion will contribute nearly 1.5% to 2023 Systemwide sales growth, in constant currencies.
• The Company expects full year 2023 selling, general and administrative expenses of about 2.2% to 2.3% of Systemwide sales.
• The Company expects 2023 operating margin percent to be about 45%.
• Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2023 to increase between
10% and 12%, driven primarily by higher average interest rates.
• The Company expects the ef fective income tax rate for the full year 2023 to be in the 20% to 22% range. Some volatility may result in a quarterly
tax rate outside of the annual range.
• The Company expects 2023 capital expenditures to be between $2.2 and $2.4 billion, about half of which will be directed towards new restaurant
unit expansion across the U.S. and International Operated Markets. Globally , the Company expects to open about 1,900 restaurants. The
Company will open more than 400 restaurants in the U.S. and International Operated Markets segments, and developmental licensees and
affiliates will contribute capital towards about 1,500 restaurant openings in their respective markets. The Company expects about 1,500 net
restaurant additions in 2023.
• The Company expects to achieve a free cash flow conversion rate greater than 90%.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page 35 of this Form
10-K. This section generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and the year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Discussions of 2020 items and the year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are not included in their entirety in this
Form 10-K and can be found in the “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of the Company’ s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022.
Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions
During the last three years, markets experienced varying levels of governmental restrictions on restaurant operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
including restrictions related to operating hours, dine-in capacity , and dining room and restaurant closures. These restrictions af fected the Company’ s revenues
for all three years, with a more limited impact in 2022 due to the lesser extent of the restrictions. As most revenues and the Company's share of net results in
equity investments are based on a percent of sales, consumer sentiment and government restrictions as a result of COVID-19 may continue to have an impact
on results.
Impact of the War in Ukraine
During the first quarter of 2022, McDonald’ s temporarily closed restaurants in Russia and Ukraine due to the ongoing war in the region. Restaurants remained
closed in Russia through the Company's sale of its Russian business in the second quarter 2022.
Beginning in September 2022, the Company began reopening restaurants in Ukraine.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS
The impact of foreign currency translation on consolidated operating results in 2022 reflected the weakening of all major currencies against the U.S. Dollar ,
driven by the Euro, British Pound, and Australian Dollar .
While changes in foreign currency exchange rates af fect reported results, McDonald’ s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and
services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows. Results excluding the ef fect of foreign currency
translation (referred to as constant currency) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates.

performance driven by higher sales-driven Franchised margins. Company-operated margins were negatively impacted by the permanent restaurant closures as
a result of the sale of the Company's business in Russia and the temporary restaurant closures in Ukraine, as well as by inflationary cost pressures. In addition,
net income reflected an income tax benefit associated with global tax audit progression.
The Company repurchased 15.8 million shares of its stock for $3.9 billion in 2022 and 3.4 million shares of its stock for $846 million in 2021.

REVENUES
The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and
affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial
fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and af filiates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial
fees. The Company’ s Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology
platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald’ s brand and, for periods prior to its

RESTAURANT MARGINS
Franchised restaurant margins are measured as revenues from franchised restaurants less franchised restaurant occupancy costs. Franchised revenues include
rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, and initial fees. Franchised restaurant occupancy costs include lease expense and depreciation, as the Company
generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for the restaurant location.
Company-operated restaurant margins are measured as sales from Company-operated restaurants less costs for food & paper , payroll & employee benefits
and occupancy & other operating expenses necessary to run an individual restaurant. Company-operated margins exclude costs that are not allocated to
individual restaurants, primarily payroll & employee benefit costs of non-restaurant support staf f, which are included in Selling, general and administrative
expenses.

In 2022, total restaurant margins increased 5% (1 1% in constant currencies), which reflected strong sales performance across all segments.
Franchised margins represented nearly 90% of restaurant margin dollars.
Total restaurant margin growth was negatively impacted in both periods by foreign currency translation due to the weakening of all major currencies against
the U.S. Dollar .
Franchised margins in the U.S. reflected higher depreciation costs related to investments in restaurant modernization.
Company-operated margins in the U.S. and International Operated Markets segment reflected positive sales performance driven by strategic menu price
increases, and the negative impact of inflationary pressures. Results in the International Operated Markets segment were also negatively impacted by the
restaurant closures in Russia and Ukraine.
Total restaurant margins included $1,501 million of depreciation and amortization expenses in 2022.

In 2022, consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% (8% in constant currencies), reflecting higher costs for investments in
restaurant technology , incremental costs related to strategic initiatives, the Company's 2022 W orldwide Owner/Operator convention and proxy contest, as well as
the impact of inflationary cost pressures.
Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are
incurred to support the overall McDonald's business.

McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 16
•Gains on sales of restaurant businesses
In 2022, gains on sales of restaurant businesses decreased primarily due to a lower number of restaurant sales in the U.S.
•Equity in earnings of unconsolidated af filiates
In 2022, equity in earnings of unconsolidated af filiates decreased due to lower equity in earnings from China as a result of the continued impact of COVID-19
related government restrictions, and lower equity in earnings from the International Operated Markets segment, primarily as a result of dissolving a restaurant
joint partnership. Results also reflected lower equity in earnings from Japan, due to the Company's reduced ownership in McDonald's Japan when compared to
2021.
•Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net
Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net reflected higher asset write-of fs, costs incurred to support the Company's business in Ukraine, and the
comparison to a prior year gain on the strategic sale of restaurant properties. Results also reflected a gain as a result of an increase to fair value of an existing
restaurant joint venture in connection with the buyout of a joint venture partner within the International Operated Markets segment.
•Impairment and other charges (gains), net
In 2022, impairment and other charges (gains), net reflected $1,281 million of pre-tax charges related to the sale of the Company's business in Russia and a pre-
tax gain of $271 million related to the Company's sale of its Dynamic Yield business.
Results in 2021 reflected net pre-tax gains of $339 million, primarily related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock. These results were partly of fset by $54
million of pre-tax charges, primarily related to the sale of McD Tech Labs.

were partly of fset by the impact of restaurant closures in Russia and Ukraine as well as inflationary pressures in Company-operated restaurant
margins.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
In 2022 and 2021, the reported ef fective income tax rates were 21.1% and 17.3%, respectively .
Results for 2022 reflected the tax impact of $537 million of nonoperating expense related to the settlement of a tax audit in France. During the year , the
Company finalized and settled certain tax examinations and remeasured other income tax reserves based on audit progression.
Results for 2021 included $364 million of income tax benefits due to a change in the U.K. statutory income tax rate. Excluding the income tax benefits and
the tax impact of net gains, the ef fective income tax rate for the year was 21.1%.
Consolidated deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, was $6.1 billion in 2022 and $6.6 billion in 2021. Substantially all of the net tax assets are
expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently issued accounting standards are included on page 41 of this Form 10-K.
CASH FLOWS
The Company has a long history of generating significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending
such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.
Cash provided by operations totaled $7.4 billion in 2022, a decrease of $1.7 billion or 19%. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion in 2022, a decrease of $1.6
billion or 23%. The Company’ s free cash flow conversion rate was 89% in 2022 and 94% in 2021. Cash provided by operations decreased in 2022 compared to
2021 primarily due to the settlement of a tax audit in France, changes in working capital, and the negative impact of foreign currency rates on operating results.
Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $512 million compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher
purchases of restaurant businesses, partly of fset by proceeds from the sale of Dynamic Yield in 2022 and proceeds from the sale of McDonald’ s Japan stock in
2021.
Cash used for financing activities totaled $6.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to increased
treasury stock purchases, partly of fset by increased net debt issuances.
The Company’ s cash and equivalents balance was $2.6 billion and $4.7 billion at year end 2022 and 2021, respectively . In addition to cash and equivalents
on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and
line of credit agreements.

RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
In 2022, the Company opened 1,576 restaurants and closed 1,332 restaurants. In 2021, the Company opened 1,494 restaurants and closed 661 restaurants.
The increase in closures in 2022 was primarily due to the closure of 855 restaurants as a result of the sale of the Company's business in Russia.

Approximately 95% of the restaurants at year-end 2022 were franchised, including 95% in the U.S., 89% in International Operated Markets and 98% in the
International Developmental Licensed Markets.
Capital expenditures decreased $141 million or 7% in 2022 due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants, primarily as a result of the sale of the
Company's business in Russia and temporary restaurant closures in Ukraine.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 20
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY TYPE (In millions)
* Primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures.
New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development
costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which
include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design ef ficiencies, as well as leveraging
the Company's global sourcing network and best practices.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company owned approximately 57% and 55%, respectively , of the land and 80% of the buildings for restaurants in
its consolidated markets.
SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS
In 2022, the Company returned approximately $8.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends paid and shares repurchased.

Total returned to shareholders $ 8,064  $ 4,765 $ 4,627 
In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, ef fective January 1, 2020, that authorized the purchase of up
to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding stock, with no specified expiration date. In 2022, approximately 15.8 million shares were repurchased for $3.9 billion,
bringing total purchases under the program to approximately 23.5 million shares or $5.6 billion.
The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 47 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year . The 2022 full year
dividend of $5.66 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $1.38 per share, with an increase to $1.52 per share paid in
the fourth quarter . This 10% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $6.08 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’ s confidence in the
ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow . As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing
needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’ s Board of Directors.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 21
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURN
Total assets decreased $3.4 billion or 6% in 2022, primarily due to a decrease in Cash and equivalents driven by lower cash from operations and increased
treasury stock purchases, partly of fset by increased net debt issuances. Net property and equipment decreased $0.9 billion in 2022, primarily due to the sale of
the Company's business in Russia. Net property and equipment and the Lease right-of-use asset, net represented approximately 47% and approximately 25%,
respectively , of total assets at year-end. Approximately 87% of total assets were in the U.S. and International Operated Markets at year-end 2022.
The Company’ s after-tax ROIC from continuing operations is a metric that management believes measures capital-allocation ef fectiveness over time and
was 22.6%, 21.5% and 14.9% as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . The increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to improved operating
results and recovery from the impact of COVID-19 as well as lower average debt balances compared to the prior year . Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1
to this Form 10-K.
FINANCING AND MARKET RISK
The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations
at December 31, 2022 totaled $35.9 billion, compared with $35.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The net increase in 2022 was due to net issuances of $1.2
billion, partly of fset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $814 million.

See the Debt Financing footnote on page 55 of this Form 10-K.
(3) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps used to hedge debt.
Standard & Poor's and Moody's currently rate the Company’ s commercial paper A-2 and P-2, respectively , and its long-term debt BBB+ and Baa1,
respectively . To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings.
Certain of the Company’ s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term
debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’ s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit
ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’ s business. In December 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $15 billion of borrowing
capacity with no specified expiration date, all of which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2022. These borrowings may include (i) public or private
offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities
available through a medium-term notes program registered with the SEC and a Global Medium-T erm Notes program, the Company is authorized to issue up to
$5 billion of commercial paper , and has $3.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement  (see the Debt Financing footnote on page 55 of this
Form 10-K).  As of December 31, 2022, the Company's subsidiaries also had $267 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign
currency line of credit agreements.
The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements. The Company manages its debt portfolio in
response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using
derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments.
In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in
which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties,
intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and af filiates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows
and shareholders’  equity . Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $13.0 billion and $12.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively . In addition, where practical, the Company’ s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the
Summary of significant accounting policies footnote related to financial instruments and hedging activities on page 45 of this Form 10-K for additional information
regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.
The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of
these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below , or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At
December 31, 2022, the Company was required to post $78 million of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's
counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on certain hedges of the Company’ s supplemental benefit plan liabilities
where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.
The Company’ s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’ s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign
currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:(1)

Australian Dollars 884 855

Polish Zloty 444 427
New Zealand Dollars 275 267
The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates on the Company’ s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a
one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the ef fects of the reduced level of economic activity that
could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction
relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however , the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the ef fect of
fluctuating currencies on the Company’ s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these
analyses of the Company’ s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2022 levels nor a 10% adverse change in
foreign currency rates from 2022 levels would materially af fect the Company’ s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.
LIQUIDITY AND USES OF CASH
The Company generates significant cash from operations and expects available cash and cash equivalents, future operating cash flows and its ability to
issue debt to be suf ficient to finance its foreseeable operating needs and other cash requirements.
Consistent with prior years, the Company expects existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, the ability to issue
domestic debt and repatriation of a portion of foreign earnings to continue to be suf ficient to fund its domestic operating, investing and financing activities. The
Company also continues to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be suf ficient to fund its foreign operating,
investing and financing activities. In the future, should more capital be required to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by domestic operations and is
available through the issuance of domestic debt, the Company could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions.
The Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where it earns approximately 60% of its operating income. A significant portion of these historical
earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing
development and growth of its international operations.
Sources of Liquidity
The Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Minimum rent payments under franchise
arrangements are based on the Company’ s underlying investment in owned sites and parallel the Company’ s underlying lease obligations and escalations on
properties that are leased. The Company believes that control over the real estate enables it to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the
highest in the industry . Refer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 49 of this Form 10-K for additional information on future gross minimum payments
due to the Company under existing conventional franchise arrangements.
Additionally , the Company is authorized to utilize up to $15 billion of borrowing capacity in various forms by the Board of Directors, all of which remained
outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The Company is also authorized to issue up to $5 billion of commercial paper , and has $3.5 billion available under a
committed line of credit agreement. Refer to the Financing and Market Risk section on page 22 of this Form 10-K.
Material Cash Requirements and Uses of Cash
Material cash requirements primarily consist of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. Refer
to the Leasing Arrangements footnote on page 50 and the Debt Financing footnote on page 55 of this Form 10-K for more information.
The Company also records liabilities related to supplemental benefit plans maintained in the U.S. as well as liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits on
certain tax positions. Details related to these obligations are provided in the Employee Benefit Plan footnote on page 54 and the Income Taxes footnote on page
52 of this Form 10-K.
The Company contracts with vendors and suppliers in the normal course of business. These contracts may include items related to construction projects,
inventory , energy , marketing, technology and other services. Generally , these items are shorter term in nature and have no minimum payment requirements.
These expenses, along with other standard operating expenses incurred, are funded from operating cash flows and reflected in other areas of this Form 10-K
(e.g., franchised margins, Company-operated margins and selling, general & administrative expenses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Income
and capital expenditures that are reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows).
Additionally , the Company has guaranteed certain loans totaling approximately $197 million at December 31, 2022. These guarantees are contingent
commitments generally issued by the Company to support borrowing arrangements of the System. At December 31, 2022, there was no carrying value for
obligations under these guarantees in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 23
OTHER MATTERS
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company’ s consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the
Company to make estimates and judgments that af fect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an
ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may dif fer from these estimates.
The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to confirm that they provide accurate and transparent
information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a
higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
•Property and equipment
Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’ s estimates of the period over which
the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with
similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. Refer to the Property and Equipment section in the Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies footnote on page 42 of this Form 10-K and the Property and Equipment footnote on page 49 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
•Leasing Arrangements
The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the Company . The Company also
uses an incremental borrowing rate in calculating the Lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a
collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment. Refer to the Leasing section in the Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies footnote on page 42 of this Form 10-K and the Leasing Arrangements footnote on page 50 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
•Long-lived assets impairment review
Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually . If qualitative indicators of impairment are present, such as changes in global and
local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends, the Company will use these and other
factors in estimating future cash flows when testing for the recoverability of its long-lived assets. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgements
based on the Company’ s experience and knowledge of its operations. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in
comparable sales. If the Company’ s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, it may be required to record impairment charges. Refer to the
Long-lived Assets and Goodwill sections in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies footnote on page 43 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
•Litigation accruals
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees,
franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property , shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments
or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. Refer to the Contingencies footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional
information.
•Income taxes
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized.
The Company operates within, and is subject to audit in, multiple taxing jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these
audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter .
Refer to the Income Taxes section in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies footnote on page 44 of this Form 10-K and the Income Taxes footnote
on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES — INFLATION
Broader inflationary pressures in the economy are expected to continue to impact the restaurant industry through supply chain, labor and energy cost
challenges. The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage these inflationary cost increases ef fectively through its rapid inventory turnover , ability to
adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 24
Other Key Information
STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH
At least annually , McDonald's considers which companies comprise a readily identifiable investment peer group. The Company is included in published
restaurant indices; however , unlike most other companies included in these indices, which have no or limited international operations, McDonald's does business
in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of its revenues and income is generated outside the U.S. In addition, because of its size, McDonald's
inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results. Therefore, the Company believes that such a comparison is not meaningful.
The Company's market capitalization, trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the U.S. economy have resulted in McDonald's inclusion
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ("DJIA") since 1985. Like McDonald's, many DJIA  companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the U.S.
and some manage global brands. Thus, the Company believes that the use of the DJIA  companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate.
The following performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns (i.e., price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends) relative to

RISK F ACTORS
Our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently
deem to be immaterial may also significantly adversely af fect our business. If any of these risks were to materialize or intensify , our expectations (or the
underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely af fected.
STRA TEGY  AND BRAND
If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to drive business growth.
To drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies must be ef fective in maintaining and strengthening
customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System’ s continued ability to:
•capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, including
by maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu items, and doubling down on digital, delivery , drive thru and restaurant development;
•innovate and dif ferentiate the McDonald’ s experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience
to our customers with profitability;
•build upon our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience;
•run great restaurants by driving ef ficiencies and expanding capacities while continuing to prioritize health and safety;
•accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities ; and
•evolve and adjust our strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior , and other events impacting our results of
operations and liquidity .
If we are delayed or unsuccessful in evolving or executing against our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business,
financial condition and results of operations may suf fer.
Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
To continue to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value and relevance of our brand, including our
corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are af fected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional
content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System,
including the people practices at McDonald’ s restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our of ferings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some
changes can occur rapidly . For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which continuously evolve and may have
contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that af fect the
“informal eating out” (“IEO”) segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by
business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, as well as by our position or
perceived lack of position on environmental, social responsibility , public policy , geopolitical and similar matters. Consumer perceptions may also be af fected by
adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment
or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate,
our brand and financial results may suf fer.
If we do not anticipate and address industry trends and evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and
marketing plans, our business could suffer .
Our continued success depends on our System’ s ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to
anticipate and respond ef fectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and industry trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food of ferings, and
consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to the use of digital channels and environmental and social responsibility matters. If we are not able
to predict, or quickly and ef fectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors are able to do so more ef fectively , our financial results could be adversely
impacted.
Our ability to build upon our strengths and advantages also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and
the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and ef fectively to evolving customer behavior and preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive
conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies and marketing plans, as well as the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important
components of our business strategy . However , they may not be successful, or may not be as successful as the ef forts of our competitors, which could
negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.
Additionally , we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching
consumers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across dif ferent channels,
including digital, allows us to reach consumers ef fectively , efficiently and in ways that are meaningful to them. If our advertising and marketing programs are not
successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 27
Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology , may not generate the expected results.
Our long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. W e continue to build upon our investments in
restaurant development, technology , digital engagement and delivery in order to transform and enhance the customer experience. As part of these investments,
we are continuing to place emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty
initiatives, mobile ordering and payment systems, and enhancing our drive thru technologies, which ef forts may not generate expected results. W e also continue
to expand and refine our delivery initiatives, including through integrating delivery and mobile ordering. Utilizing a third-party delivery service may not have the
same level of profitability as a non-delivery transaction, and may introduce additional food quality , food safety and customer satisfaction risks. If these customer
experience initiatives are not successfully executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may
suffer.
We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.
We compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. W e also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other
competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores, cof fee shops and online retailers. W e
expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by a contracting IEO segment or
by new or continuing actions, product of ferings or consolidation of our competitors and third-party partners, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our
results.
We compete primarily on the basis of product choice, quality , affordability , service and location. In particular , we believe our ability to compete successfully
in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, successfully develop and introduce new products, price our products
appropriately , deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations, manage our investments in technology , restaurant
modernization, digital engagement and delivery , and respond ef fectively to our competitors’  actions or of ferings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be
no assurance these strategies will be ef fective, and some strategies may be ef fective at improving some metrics while adversely af fecting others, which could
have the overall ef fect of harming our business.
We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others,
which could harm the value of the McDonald’ s brand and our business.
Our success depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further
develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. W e rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets,
patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.
We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that
we currently use have not been, and may never be, registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the
future. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property , and the steps we have taken to do so in the U.S. and foreign countries may not
be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may
claim infringement by us in the future. In particular , we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to
enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might af fect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit,
could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.
In addition, we cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that adversely
affect the value of our intellectual property .
OPERA TIONS
The global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.
We encounter dif fering cultural, regulatory , geopolitical and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonald’ s
restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System’ s success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations
is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System’ s ability to leverage
operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald’ s customers and
could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and market share.
Disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or trade-related tarif fs
or controls, trade policies and regulations, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our , our franchisees’  or our suppliers’  operations,
and asset seizures. Such disruptions or volatility can also result from acts of war , terrorism or other hostilities. For example, the war between Russia and Ukraine
has resulted in volatile and unpredictable conditions throughout the region, exacerbated volatile macroeconomic conditions and increased pressure on our
supply chain and the availability and costs of commodities, including energy , which we expect to continue to impact our financial results. The broader impacts of
the war and related sanctions, including on macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical tensions, consumer demand and the ability of us and our franchisees to
operate in certain geographic areas, may also continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
While we may face challenges and uncertainties in any of the markets in which we operate, such challenges and uncertainties are often heightened in
developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability , economic volatility , crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many
cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced,
including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage ef fectively the risks associated with our international
operations could adversely af fect our business and financial results.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 28
Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.
We depend on the ef fectiveness of our supply chain management to assure a reliable and suf ficient supply of quality products on favorable terms.
Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which
may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases have in the past and may in the future adversely af fect us
as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be
caused by shortages, inflationary pressures, unexpected increases in demand, transportation-related issues, labor-related issues, technology-related issues,
weather-related events, natural disasters, acts of war , terrorism or other hostilities, or other factors beyond the control of us or our suppliers or franchisees.
Interruptions in our System’ s supply chain or inef fective contingency planning can increase our costs and/or limit the availability of products critical to our
System’ s operations.
Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.
Our success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our
developmental licensees and af filiates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a
percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses
independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely
dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks af fecting our operations also af fect our franchisees. If franchisee sales trends
worsen, or any of such risks materialize or intensify , our financial results could be negatively af fected, which may be material.
Our success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and af filiates to implement major initiatives, which may include
financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to
contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively
impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks’  lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in
major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
Our operating performance could also be negatively af fected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image
inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and
potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand’ s image and reputation
could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.
Our ownership mix also af fects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is
driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors, including whether
we have ef fectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or af filiates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our
structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.
Challenges with respect to labor , including availability and cost, could impact our business and results of operations.
Our success depends in part on our System’ s ability to ef fectively attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in McDonald’ s
restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staf fed restaurants in an intensely competitive labor market. W e and our franchisees have experienced and may
continue to experience challenges in adequately staf fing certain McDonald’ s restaurants, which can negatively impact operations, including speed of service to
customers, and customer satisfaction levels. The System’ s ability to meet its labor needs is generally subject to external factors, including the availability of
sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate.
Further , our System has experienced increased costs and competition associated with attracting, recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining qualified
employees, as well as with promoting awareness of the opportunities of working at McDonald’ s restaurants. W e and our franchisees also continue to be
impacted by increasingly complex U.S. and international laws and regulations af fecting our respective workforces. These laws and regulations are increasingly
focused on, and in certain cases impose requirements with respect to, employment matters such as wages and hours, healthcare, immigration, retirement and
other employee benefits and workplace practices. Such laws and regulations can expose us and our franchisees to increased costs and other ef fects of
compliance, including potential liability , and all such labor and compliance costs could have a negative impact on our Company-operated margins and franchisee
profitability .
Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or
suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety , could have a negative impact on
consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally , economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations,
could adversely af fect us (including our ability to attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers, whose performance may
have a significant impact on our results.
Effective succession planning is important to our continued success.
Effective succession planning for management is important to our long-term success. Failure to ef fectively attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain
qualified key personnel, or to execute smooth personnel transitions, could disrupt our business and adversely af fect our results.
Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.
Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our System’ s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential
impact on McDonald’ s of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future, including in the supply chain, restaurants or delivery .
Food safety is a top priority , and we dedicate substantial resources aimed at ensuring that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and
service model evolve. However , food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, occur within the food industry and our System from time to time
and could occur in the future. Instances of food
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 29
tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely af fect our brand, reputation and financial results.
If we do not effectively manage our real estate portfolio, our operating results may be negatively impacted.
We have significant real estate operations, primarily in connection with our restaurant business. W e generally own or secure a long-term lease on the
land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites. W e seek to identify and develop restaurant locations that of fer
convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. As we generally secure long-term real estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited
flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio. The competitive business landscape continues to evolve in light of changing business trends, consumer
preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital, delivery and drive thru, local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants
are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely af fect Systemwide sales and profitability .
Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors, including governmental
regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels, the cost of financing, natural disasters, acts of war , terrorism or other hostilities,
or other factors beyond our control. A significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as a result of any of these factors, could adversely af fect
our operating results.
Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security , may impact our operations or cause reputational harm.
We are increasingly reliant upon technology systems, such as point-of-sale, that support our business operations, including our digital and delivery
solutions, and technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration with af filiated entities, customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers, service
providers or other independent third parties to conduct our business, whether developed and maintained by us or provided by third parties. Any failure or
interruption of these systems could significantly impact our or our franchisees’  operations, or our customers’  experiences and perceptions.
Security incidents or breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties with whom
we communicate or collaborate (including franchisees) or the systems of third-party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing
attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers.
Certain of these technology systems contain personal, financial and other information of our customers, employees, franchisees and their employees, suppliers
and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. Despite response procedures and measures in
place in the event of an incident, a security breach could result in disruptions, shutdowns, or the theft or unauthorized disclosure of such information. The actual
or alleged occurrence of any of these incidents could result in mitigation costs, reputational damage, adverse publicity , loss of consumer confidence, reduced
sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including criminal penalties or civil liabilities.
Despite the implementation of business continuity measures, any of these technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures
due to fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Certain technology systems may also become vulnerable, unreliable or
inefficient in cases where technology vendors limit or terminate product support and maintenance. Our increasing reliance on third-party systems also subjects
us to risks faced by those third-party businesses, including operational, security and credit risks. If technology systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable,
or if business continuity or disaster recovery plans were not ef fective, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner , we could experience an interruption in
our or our franchisees’  operations.
LEGAL  AND REGULA TORY
Increasing regulatory and legal complexity may adversely affect our business and financial results.
Our regulatory and legal environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that could af fect our operations and results
in material ways. Many of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations involving, among other matters, restaurant
operations, product packaging, marketing, the nutritional and allergen content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices.
Compliance ef forts with those regulations may be af fected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the
accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers. W e also are subject to increasing public focus, including by governmental and non-
governmental organizations, on environmental, social responsibility and corporate governance (“ESG”) matters. Our success depends in part on our ability to
manage the impact of regulations and other initiatives that can af fect our business plans and operations, which have increased and may continue to increase our
costs of doing business and exposure to litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings.
We are also subject to legal proceedings that may adversely af fect our business, including, but not limited to, class actions, administrative proceedings,
government investigations and proceedings, shareholder proceedings, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, supplier-related
disputes, and claims by current or former franchisees. Regardless of whether claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be
expensive to defend and may divert management’ s attention away from operations.
Litigation and regulatory action concerning our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law
or other purposes, if determined adversely , could increase costs, negatively impact our business operations and the business prospects of our franchisees and
subject us to incremental liability for their actions. Similarly , although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts
to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely , could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and
subject us to incremental liability for their actions.
Our results could also be af fected by the following:
•the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number , nature and procedural status of pending
proceedings;
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 30
•the cost and other ef fects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that
may af fect perceptions of our brand and products; and
•adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the
appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices.
A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third-party indemnity could materially adversely af fect our financial condition or
results of operations. Further , adverse publicity resulting from claims may hurt our business. If we are unable to ef fectively manage the risks associated with our
complex regulatory and legal environment, it could have a material adverse ef fect on our business and financial condition.
Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability .
We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are af fected by tax and other
initiatives around the world. In particular , we are af fected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations. W e are also
impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities inside and outside of the U.S. in connection with
our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or
unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
Changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results.
New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical
accounting estimates, could adversely af fect our future results. W e may also be af fected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or
assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings.
In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future
cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and
economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, interest rate levels, competition, consumer and demographic trends and our restructuring activities. If our
estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. Any such changes could have a significant
adverse ef fect on our reported results for the af fected periods.
If we fail to comply with privacy and data protection laws, we could be subject to legal proceedings and penalties, which could negatively affect our
financial results or brand perceptions.
We are subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability related to privacy and data protection requirements, including those associated with
our technology-related services and platforms made available to business partners, customers, employees, franchisees or other third parties. An increasing
number of jurisdictions have enacted new privacy and data protection requirements (including the European Union’ s General Data Protection Regulation and
various U.S. state-level laws), and further requirements are likely to be proposed or enacted in the future. Failure to comply with these privacy and data
protection laws could result in legal proceedings and substantial penalties and materially adversely impact our financial results or brand perceptions.
MACROECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS
Unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Our results of operations are substantially af fected by economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, which can vary significantly by market and
can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors, including hostilities,
epidemics, pandemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity , stimulus measures
or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability , inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Sustained adverse
economic conditions or periodic adverse changes in economic conditions put pressure on our operating performance and business continuity disruption
planning, and our business and financial results may suf fer as a result.
Our results of operations are also af fected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and unfavorable currency fluctuations could adversely af fect
reported earnings.
Health epidemics or pandemics could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Health epidemics or pandemics – such as the global outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 – have in the past and may in the future impact macroeconomic
conditions, consumer behavior , labor availability and supply chain management, as well as local operations in impacted markets, all of which can adversely
affect our business, financial results and outlook. Governmental responses to health epidemics or pandemics, including operational restrictions, can also af fect
the foregoing items and adversely af fect our business and financial results. The duration and scope of a health epidemic or pandemic can be dif ficult to predict
and depends on many factors, including the emergence of new variants and the availability , acceptance and ef fectiveness of preventative measures. A health
epidemic or pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, including, but not limited to, those related to the availability and costs of
labor and commodities, supply chain interruptions, consumer behavior , and consumer perceptions of our brand and industry .
Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
The profitability of our Company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food,
paper , supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs, including labor . Volatility in certain commodity prices and fluctuations in labor costs have
adversely af fected and in the future could adversely af fect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability . The commodity markets for some of the
ingredients we use, such as beef, chicken and pork, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand and
other macroeconomic conditions, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls, government regulation, and acts of war , terrorism or
other hostilities, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. Our System can only partially address future price risk through
hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability .
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 31
A decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability .
Our credit ratings may be negatively af fected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. As a result, our interest expense, the availability
of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, our collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be
negatively af fected, especially if lenders were to impose new operating or financial covenants.
Our operations may also be impacted by regulations af fecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage
and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. Any such events could have a material adverse ef fect on our business and financial condition.
The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.
Many factors af fect the trading volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. These factors, many of which
are beyond our control, include the following:
•the unpredictable nature of global economic and market conditions;
•governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets,
particularly in the U.S., which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic, trade or
other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;
•trading activity in our common stock, in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or in our debt securities, which can be af fected
by: market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or
expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our
performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our common stock by
significant shareholders; and trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald’ s may be

•the impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and
•the impact of corporate actions, including changes to our corporate structure, and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such

Our business is subject to an increasing focus on ESG matters.
In recent years, there has been an increasing focus by stakeholders – including employees, franchisees, customers, suppliers, governmental and non-
governmental organizations and investors – on ESG matters. A failure, whether real or perceived, to address ESG matters or to achieve progress on our ESG
initiatives on the anticipated timing or at all, could adversely af fect our business, including by heightening other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, such as
those related to consumer behavior , consumer perceptions of our brand, labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, and legal and
regulatory complexity . Conversely , our taking a position, whether real or perceived, on ESG, public policy , geopolitical and similar matters could also adversely
impact our business.
The standards we set for ourselves regarding ESG matters, and our ability to meet such standards, may also impact our business. For example, we are
working to manage risks and costs to our System related to climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources, and we have
announced initiatives relating to, among other things, climate action, sustainability , responsible sourcing and increasing diverse representation across our
System. W e have faced increased scrutiny related to reporting on and achieving these initiatives, as well as continued public focus on similar matters, such as
packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. W e have also experienced increased pressure from stakeholders to provide
expanded disclosure and establish additional commitments, targets or goals, and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to additional market,
operational, execution and reputational costs and risks. Moreover , addressing ESG matters requires Systemwide coordination and alignment, and the standards
by which certain ESG matters are measured are evolving and subject to assumptions that could change over time.
Events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest and climate change, among others, can adversely affect our
results and prospects.
Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war , terrorism or other hostilities, social unrest or climate change (or expectations about them) can
adversely af fect consumer behavior and confidence levels, supply availability and costs and local operations in impacted markets, all of which can af fect our
results and prospects. Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of weather-related events and natural disasters. Our receipt of proceeds
under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insuf ficient to cover our losses fully .

In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of
subjects, including, but not limited to, quality , service, cleanliness, menu pricing, alleged discrimination, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchise
grants, renewals and terminations. Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals or entities who claim they should be (or should have
been) granted a franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes.
•Suppliers
The Company and its af filiates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonald’ s restaurants. The Company relies upon
numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Company’ s high standards and specifications.
Occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former suppliers relating to, for example, compliance with product specifications and the

(including relating to nutrition) and other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company .
•Intellectual Property

time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to protect its intellectual property and defend against the alleged use of third-party intellectual
property .
•Government Regulations
National and local governments have adopted laws and regulations relating to various aspects of the restaurant business, including, but not limited to,
advertising, franchising, health, safety , environment, competition, zoning, employment and taxation. The Company is occasionally involved in litigation or other
proceedings regarding these matters. While the Company strives to comply with all applicable existing statutory and administrative requirements, it cannot
predict the ef fect on its operations of these matters or the issuance or enactment of any future additional requirements.
PROPERTIES
The Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that of fer
convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the System. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traf fic and walking patterns,
census data and other relevant data. The Company’ s experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally
owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites, which facilitates long-term
occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing ef forts are made
to control average development costs through construction and design ef ficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Company’ s global sourcing network.
In addition, the Company primarily leases real estate in connection with its corporate headquarters, field and other of fices.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
NATURE OF BUSINESS
The Company franchises and operates McDonald’ s restaurants in the global restaurant industry . All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by
franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchised arrangements, and developmental licensees or af filiates under license agreements.
The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type:
Restaurants at December 31, 2022 2021 2020
Conventional franchised 21,720  21,607 21,712 
Developmental licensed 8,229  7,913 7,663 
Foreign af filiated 8,220  7,775 7,146 
    Total Franchised 38,169  37,295 36,521 
    Company-operated 2,106  2,736 2,677 
        T otal Systemwide restaurants 40,275  40,031 39,198 
The results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the
aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale.
CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in af filiates owned 50% or less (primarily
McDonald’ s China and Japan) are accounted for by the equity method.
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees,
suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally , these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable
interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented.
ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that af fect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could dif fer from those estimates.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Generally , the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency .
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Leases
In July 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "F ASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2021-05, "Leases (T opic 842): Lessors—
Certain Leases with V ariable Lease Payments" ("ASU 2021-05"). The pronouncement amends the current guidance on classification for a lease that includes
variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate. Under the amended guidance, a lessor must classify as an operating lease any lease that would
otherwise be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease and that would result in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement. ASU 2021-05
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including applicable interim periods. The Company adopted the new standard ef fective January
1, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material ef fect on the Company’ s consolidated financial statements.
Reference Rate Reform
In March 2020, the F ASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (T opic 848): Facilitation of the Ef fects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial
Reporting" (“ASU 2020-04”). The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and
hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Of fered Rate and other interbank
offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was ef fective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and
hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material ef fect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 41
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and
affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial
fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and af filiates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial
fees. The Company’ s Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology
platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald’ s brand and third-party revenues for
the Dynamic Yield business, for periods prior to its sale on April 1, 2022.
Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other
sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur . Rental income includes both
minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term (with the exception of rent concessions as a result of COVID-19 – refer to the
Leasing section that follows) and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur . Initial fees are
recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.
The Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement
because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these
arrangements. Accordingly , the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the
goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a
percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur . For periods prior to April 1, 2022, Dynamic Yield third party revenues were generated
from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
buildings–up to 40 years; leasehold improvements–the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and
equipment–3 to 12 years.
The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of
property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened,
resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-of fs in future periods.
The Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees, primarily in the U.S. Since McDonald's manages the project
and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of McDonald's and which are the
responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the
project, the allocation of costs is finalized and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.
Refer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 49 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
LEASING
The Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building)
and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the
Company’ s estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted
using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency
environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of of fice equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or
Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as
site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability , the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned restaurant locations. For franchised
locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are
generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-restaurant related
leases such as of fice buildings, vehicles and of fice equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company’ s lease portfolio.
In 2020, the Company elected the practical expedient to account for COVID-19 related rent concessions as if they were part of the enforceable rights and
obligations of the parties under the existing lease contract. This was elected for the Company’ s entire lessee and lessor portfolio for any rent deferrals or rent
abatements. For the lessee portfolio, the Company elected not to remeasure the Lease right- of-use asset and Lease liability if a rent deferral or a rent
abatement was granted. Refer to the Leasing Arrangements footnote on page 50 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Lease right-of-use asset and
Lease liability .
Rental income includes both minimum rent payments and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales.
Refer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 49 of this Form 10-K for additional information on deferred collections of rental income as well as
royalties.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 42
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE
Capitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 2 to
10 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back of fice and Corporate systems may have a longer useful life.
Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within Miscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions):
2022-$864.3; 2021-$795.0; 2020-$691.2.
The Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists, which occurs more regularly throughout the year , such as when new software may be ready for its
intended use. The Company did not identify any indicators of material impairment of capitalized software for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Results for 2020 reflected write-of fs of impaired software of $26.3 million.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonald’ s restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped
together in the U.S. at a field of fice level, and internationally , at a market level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant
common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant’ s cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If
an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the
asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying
amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.
Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Company's Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to
a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are
expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally , such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as
well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered “held for sale."
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses, and it is
generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The Company's goodwill
primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees or transactions in which the Company obtains a controlling interest in subsidiaries
or affiliates. When purchasing restaurants from a franchisee, the Company generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology (Level 3 inputs within the
valuation hierarchy), which determines the fair value of restaurants acquired based on their expected profitability and cash flows. During 2022, the Company
acquired restaurants from franchisees in order to expand its Company-operated restaurant footprint in key growth areas and to support key strategic franchising
initiatives. In conjunction with these purchases, the Company recorded approximately $75 million of net tangible assets, $525 million of identifiable intangible
assets (primarily consisting of reacquired franchise rights) and $190 million of goodwill. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on the amount of
recorded revenues or net income of the Company . If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the
acquisition is written of f in its entirety . If a Company-operated restaurant is sold beyond 24 months months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written of f
is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.
The following table presents the 2022 activity in goodwill by segment:
In millions U.S.International
Operated MarketsInternational Developmental
Licensed Markets & Corporate Consolidated
Balance at December 31, 2021 $1,673.4 $ 1,109.1 $ — $2,782.5 
Net restaurant purchases (sales) 141.8 47.0 — 188.8 
Currency translation — (70.9) — (70.9)
Balance at December 31, 2022 $1,815.2  $ 1,085.2  $ — $2,900.4  
The Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever indicators of impairment exist. If an indicator of
impairment exists, the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying
amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the dif ference. In the current period,
the Company performed a qualitative assessment and did not identify any indicators of impairment. Historically , goodwill impairment has not significantly
impacted the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects accumulated impairment losses of $14.5 million as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives based upon a
percent of sales, and were (in millions): 2022–$334.5; 2021–$377.6; 2020–$325.5. The decrease in 2022 is primarily due to lower sales in the International
Operated Markets as a result of the sale of the Company's business in Russia and the temporary restaurant closures in Ukraine.
In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by conventional franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets that
are also based upon a percent of sales. In the markets that make up the vast majority of the Systemwide advertising spend, including the U.S., McDonald’ s is
not the primary beneficiary of these entities, and therefore has concluded that consolidation would not be appropriate, as the Company does not have the power
through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the cooperatives that most significantly impact their economic performance.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 43
Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as
well as other marketing-related expenses are included in Selling, general & administrative expenses and were (in millions): 2022–$63.8; 2021–$82.9; 2020–
$329.2. Results for 2020 included about $175 million of incremental marketing contributions by the Company to the System's advertising cooperative
arrangements across the U.S. and International Operated Markets, as well as higher investments in brand communications.
INCOME TAXES
Income T ax Uncertainties
The Company , like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years
after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly , tax liabilities are recorded when, in management’ s judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not
threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on management’ s
assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for
income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary dif ferences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis
of existing assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax
strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future,
the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is
made.
Refer to the Income Taxes footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Accounting for Global Intangible Low-T axed Income ("GIL TI")
The accounting policy of the Company is to record any tax on GIL TI in the provision for income taxes in the year it is incurred.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring
basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an
orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy , maximizing the use of
observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are
defined as follows:
▪Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market.
▪Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all
significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability .
▪Level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability .
Certain of the Company’ s derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market
parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and foreign currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy . Derivative
valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company . 
▪Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair V alue

McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 44
▪Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair V alue on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing
basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). For the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, the Company did not record any material fair value adjustments to long-lived assets (including goodwill).
▪Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair V alue
At December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Company’ s debt obligations was estimated at $33.5 billion, compared to a carrying amount of $35.9 billion. The fair
value was based on quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy . The carrying amount of cash and equivalents and notes receivable
approximate fair value.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the ef fect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign
currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading
purposes.
The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items. The Company’ s derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency
forwards, and cross-currency interest rate swaps, and are classified as either fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Further details are explained in the
"Fair V alue," "Cash Flow" and "Net Investment" hedge sections.
The Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts,
including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency
forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Further details are explained in the “Undesignated
Derivatives” section.
All derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value and classified based
on the instruments’  maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to AOCI and/or current
earnings.
The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Fair V alue Hedges
The Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in fair values of certain liabilities. The Company enters into fair value hedges that
convert a portion of its fixed rate debt into floating rate debt by use of interest rate swaps.  At December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of fixed-rate debt that was
effectively converted was an equivalent notional amount of $1.2 billion, which included a decrease of $91.5 million of cumulative hedging adjustments. For the
year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a $96.3 million loss on the fair value of interest rate swaps, and a corresponding gain on the fair value
of the related hedged debt instrument to interest expense.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. To protect against the reduction in value of
forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards to hedge a portion of
anticipated exposures. The hedges cover up to the next 18 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2022,
the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $1.5 billion that hedged a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated
cash flows.
Based on market conditions at December 31, 2022, the $30.7 million in cumulative cash flow hedging gains, after tax, is not expected to have a significant
effect on earnings over the next 12 months.
Net Investment Hedges
The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) as well as foreign currency derivatives to hedge its investments in certain
foreign subsidiaries and af filiates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency
translation component of Other comprehensive income ("OCI") and of fset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and
affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2022, $12.2 billion of the Company's third party foreign currency denominated debt, $679 million
of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt, and $585 million of foreign currency derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign
subsidiaries and af filiates.
Undesignated Derivatives
The Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. Therefore, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are
recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. As an example, the Company enters into equity
derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value
of these derivatives are recorded in Selling, general & administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition,
the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in
the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in Nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet
position.
Credit Risk
The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not have significant
exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2022 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes,
the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting
arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below , or aggregate exposures exceed, certain
contractual limits. At December 31, 2022, the Company was required to post $78 million of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions.
The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on certain hedges of the Company’ s supplemental
benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.(1)

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted
stock units (“RSUs”) to employees and nonemployee directors.
Share-based compensation, which includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value, is generally amortized
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general & administrative expenses.
The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions,
which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’ s stock over the
expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly
for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. In addition, the Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount
of compensation costs to be recognized each period.
The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’ s stock at date of grant. For performance-based RSUs, the Company
includes a relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of
performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
Refer to the Share-based Compensation footnote on page 56 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
PER COMMON SHARE INFORMA TION
Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include
weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive ef fect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares):
2022–4.8; 2021–5.5; 2020–5.5. Share-based compensation awards that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been
antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2022–1.5; 2021–2.2; 2020–1.8.
CASH AND EQUIV ALENTS
The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, Cash
and equivalents was $2.6 billion of which $1.8 billion consisted of certificates of deposit.

Buildings and improvements on leased land and Equipment, signs and seating from 2021 to 2022 was primarily driven by the Company's sale of the business in

Franchise Arrangements
Conventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to
the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments. Minimum rent payments are based on the Company's underlying investment in
owned sites and parallel the Company’ s underlying leases and escalations on properties that are leased. Under the franchise arrangement, franchisees are
granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonald’ s System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility , generally for a period of 20 years. At
the end of the 20-year franchise arrangement, the Company maintains control of the underlying real estate and building and can either enter into a new 20-year
franchise arrangement with the existing franchisee or a dif ferent franchisee, or close the restaurant. Franchisees generally pay related occupancy costs including
property taxes, insurance and site maintenance.
Developmental licensees and af filiates operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and generally pay
initial fees.
McDonald’ s has elected to allocate consideration in the franchise contract among lease and non-lease components in the same manner that it has
historically: rental income (lease), royalty income (non-lease) and initial fee income (non-lease). This disaggregation and presentation of revenue is based on the
nature, amount, timing and certainty of the revenue and cash flows. The allocation has been determined based on a mix of both observable and estimated
standalone selling prices (the price at which an entity would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer).
Revenues from franchised restaurants consisted of:
In millions 2022 2021 2020
Rents $ 9,045.7  $ 8,381.1 $ 6,844.7 
Royalties 5,005.6  4,645.1 3,831.5 
Initial fees 54.5 59.2 49.9 
Revenues from franchised restaurants $ 14,105.8  $ 13,085.4 $ 10,726.1 
As rent and royalties are based upon a percent of sales, government restrictions as a result of COVID-19 had a more significant negative impact on
revenues in 2020. The Company granted the deferrals of cash collection for certain rent and royalties earned from franchisees in substantially all markets
primarily in the first half of 2020. In total, the Company deferred collection of approximately $1 billion and has collected all of these deferrals as of December 31,
2022.

McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 49
Leasing Arrangements
The Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building)
and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease
terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow , are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options.
Renewal options are typically solely at the Company’ s discretion. Escalation terms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations
based on an inflation index and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally range from annually to every five years.
The following table provides detail of rent expense:
In millions 2022 2021 2020
Restaurants $1,416.4  $1,486.3 $1,399.5 
Other 59.7 74.0 79.8 
Total rent expense $1,476.1  $1,560.3 $1,479.3 
Rent expense included percent rents in excess of minimum rents (in millions) as follows–Company-operated restaurants: 2022–$39.6; 2021–$69.2; 2020–
$53.7. Franchised restaurants: 2022–$209.0; 2021–$160.0; 2020–$136.5. These variable rent payments are based on a percent of sales.
The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term,
which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental borrowing rate. Typically , renewal options
are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the associated asset lives of the building or leasehold improvements exceed that of the initial lease
term, and the sales performance of the restaurant remains strong. Therefore, the Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability include an assumption on renewal
options that have not yet been exercised by the Company , and are not currently a future obligation.
The Company's lease portfolio includes both operating and finance leases, however as of December 31, 2022, the vast majority of the portfolio was
classified as operating leases.
As the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability that represents
an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment.
The weighted average discount rate used for leases was  3.5% as of December 31, 2022 and 3.7% as of December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2022, maturities of lease liabilities for the Company's lease portfolio were as follows:
In millions Total *
2023 $ 1,161.6

Less: imputed interest (5,441.3)
Present value of lease liability $ 12,795.5 
*    Total lease payments include option periods that are reasonably assured of being exercised.
The decrease in the present value of the lease liability since December 31, 2021 is approximately $(0.9) billion. The lease liability will continue to be
impacted by new leases, lease modifications, lease terminations, reevaluation of lease terms, and foreign currency .
The W eighted Average Lease Term remaining that is included in the maturities of lease liabilities was 19 years as of December 31, 2022 and 20 years as of
December 31, 2021.

Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees,
franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property , shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments
or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any , for these contingencies is
made after careful analysis of each matter . The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in a particular matter or changes in
approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed
will have a material adverse ef fect on its financial condition or results of operations.

▪Gains on sales of restaurant businesses
The Company’ s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at maintaining an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or
losses on sales of restaurant businesses are recorded in operating income because these transactions are a recurring part of the Company's business.
▪Equity in earnings of unconsolidated af filiates
Unconsolidated af filiates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in
(earnings) losses from these entities representing McDonald’ s share of results for markets in both the International Operated Markets and International
Developmental Licensed Markets segments. For foreign af filiated markets—primarily China and Japan—results are reported net of interest expense and income
taxes.
▪Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net
Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant
closings, reserves for bad debts, asset write-of fs due to restaurant reinvestment, strategic sale of properties, and other miscellaneous income and expenses.
▪Impairment and other charges (gains), net
Impairment and other charges (gains), net includes losses that result from the write down of goodwill and long-lived assets from their carrying value to their fair
value, as well as charges associated with strategic initiatives, such as refranchising and restructuring activities. The realized gains/losses from the divestiture of
ownership percentages of subsidiaries are reflected in this category , including the gains on sale of McDonald's Japan stock in 2020 and 2021, which reduced the
Company's ownership in McDonald's Japan from 49% to 35%. Additionally , in 2022 this category includes $1.3 billion of charges related to the sale of the
Company's business in Russia and a gain of $271 million related to the Company's sale of its Dynamic Yield business.

Effective income tax rates 21.1 % 17.3 % 23.0 %
The 2022 ef fective income tax rate reflected the tax impact of $537 million of non-operating expense related to the settlement of the tax audit in France. In
2021, U.S./Foreign tax law changes included a $364 million income tax benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of a change in the
U.K. statutory income tax rate.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’ s gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $647.0 million and $1,504.9 million, respectively . After
considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $410 million of the total as of December 31, 2022 would favorably af fect the ef fective
tax rate if resolved in the Company’ s favor .
The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:
In millions 2022 2021
Balance at January 1 $ 1,504.9  $ 1,479.2 
Decreases for positions taken in prior years (579.4) (31.9)

Settlements with taxing authorities (428.1) (16.8)
Lapsing of statutes of limitations (0.5) (12.4)
Balance at December 31 $ 647.0  $ 1,504.9 
(1) Of this amount, $619.6 million and $1,157.5 million are included in Long-term income taxes for 2022 and 2021, respectively , and $27.3 million and $332.0 million are included in Prepaid
expenses and other current assets for 2022 and 2021, respectively , on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remainder is included in Deferred income taxes on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
In 2015, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") issued a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments
related to the Company’ s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed
transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest, and beginning in December 2018 the Company met with the IRS Appeals
team regarding settlement of these issues. In February 2023, the Company finalized a settlement agreement with the IRS Appeals team related to the disagreed
transfer pricing matters for the years 2009-2010.
In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company’ s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 201 1 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS issued a RAR for these
years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Also in 2018, the Company filed a protest with
the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. The Company continues to meet with the IRS Appeals team regarding the settlement of these issues.
The Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing, and the Company is under audit in
multiple state tax jurisdictions. While the Company cannot estimate the impact to the ef fective tax rate, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $70 million within the next 12 months. This would be due to the possible settlement of the IRS transfer pricing
matters, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. In 2022, the
Company settled an income tax audit with France, which resulted in $537 million of nondeductible non-operating expense and conclusion of income tax matters
related to transfer pricing for the years 2009-2020.
During 2022, the Company finalized and settled certain tax examinations and remeasured other income tax reserves based on audit progression. It is
reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12 months, there may be new information that
causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information
may have on the unrecognized tax benefit balance, it believes that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate.
The Company operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject
to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2009.
The Company had $24.7 million and $183.6 million accrued for interest and penalties related to tax matters at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively .
The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $90.5 million in 2022, $24.4 million in 2021, and $32.4 million in 2020, which are
included in the provision for income taxes.(1)
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 53
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries, which were predominantly taxed in
the U.S. as a result of the transition tax provisions enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Management does not assert that these previously-taxed
unremitted earnings are indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. Accordingly , the Company has provided deferred taxes for the tax ef fects
incremental to the transition tax. The Company has not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis dif ferences in its investments in its foreign subsidiaries that
are unrelated to these accumulated undistributed earnings, as these outside basis dif ferences are indefinitely reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized
deferred taxes related to these other components of the outside basis dif ferences is not practicable.
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company's 401(k) Plan is maintained for U.S.-based employees and includes a 401(k) feature, as well as an employer match. The 401(k) feature allows
eligible participants to make pre-tax contributions that are matched each pay period (with an annual true-up) through cash contributions.
All current account balances, future contributions and related earnings can be invested in nine investment alternatives (including a target date fund series),
as well as McDonald’ s stock in accordance with each participant’ s investment elections. Future participant contributions are limited to 20% investment in
McDonald’ s stock and participants may not transfer their existing account balance into McDonald’ s stock if the transfer would cause the value of their interest in
the fund to exceed 20% of their total 401(k) Plan account balance. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances
and future contributions.
The Company also maintains certain unfunded nonqualified supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii)
receive an annual Company-match allocation that cannot be made under the 401(k) Plan because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are
based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the 401(k) Plan, net of expenses. Total liabilities were $380.0 million and $456.8 million at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively , and were primarily included in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2022, derivatives with a fair
value of $200.5 million  indexed to the Company's stock and a total return swap with a notional amount of $164.4 million indexed to certain market indices were
included at their fair value in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans

Debt Financing
LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS
At December 31, 2022, the Company had a line of credit agreement of $3.5 billion, which expires in December 2024. The Company incurs fees of 0.08% per
annum on the total commitment, which remained unused. Fees and interest rates on this line are primarily based on the Company's long-term credit rating
assigned by Moody’ s and Standard & Poor's. In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and
denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest.
The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 5.2% at December 31, 2022 (based on $264.5 million of foreign currency bank line
borrowings) and 2.4% at December 31, 2021 (based on $263.1 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings).
DEBT OBLIGATIONS
The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private of ferings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Company’ s debt
obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’ s business. Certain of
the Company’ s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain
subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity , either at par or at a premium over par . The Company has no
current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity , but continues to look for ways to optimize its debt portfolio.
The following table summarizes the Company’ s debt obligations (interest rates and debt amounts reflected in the table include the ef fects of interest rate
swaps used to hedge debt).

As of December 31, 2022, there was $161.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.
STOCK OPTIONS
Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant.
Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the
grant date.
The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2022, 2021 and 2020 stock option grants. The
expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price
volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Company’ s stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based
on the Company’ s most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in ef fect at the time of grant with a term
equal to the expected life.

Fair value per option granted $ 42.12  $ 30.91 $ 29.40 
Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the dif ference between the current market value of the Company’ s stock and the exercise price. During 2022,
2021 and 2020, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $242.2 million, $302.0 million and $290.4 million, respectively . Cash received from stock
options exercised during 2022 was $248.2 million and the tax benefit realized from stock options exercised totaled $48.3 million. The Company uses treasury
shares purchased under the Company’ s share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises.

RSUs
RSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of the Company’ s common stock or cash, at the Company’ s
discretion. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’ s stock at date of grant. Separately , Company of ficers have been
awarded RSUs that vest based on Company performance. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative TSR modifier to determine the
number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a
Monte Carlo valuation model.

Management’ s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
The financial statements were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity and for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal controls over financial reporting.
The Company’ s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’ s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
I.pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company;
II.provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and
III.provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’ s assets that
could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
There are inherent limitations in the ef fectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly , even ef fective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further , because of
changes in conditions, the ef fectiveness of internal controls may vary over time.
Management assessed the design and ef fectiveness of the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).
Based on management’ s assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2022, management believes that the Company’ s internal control over financial
reporting is ef fective.
Ernst & Young, LLP , independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Their reports are presented on the
following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make
recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action.

McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 58
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonald’ s Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McDonald’ s Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related
consolidated statements  of income, comprehens ive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December  31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’ s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit s in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whethe r the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures  in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounti ng principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to
be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below , providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter
or on the accounts or disclosure to which it relates.
McDonald's Corporation 2022 Annual Report 59
Valuation of Unrecognized T ax Benefits and Related Regulatory Actions
Description of the
MatterAs describe d in the Income Taxes footnote to the consolidated financial statements, the Com pany’ s unrecognized tax benefits, which
includes transfer pricing matters, totaled $647.0 million at December 31, 2022. The Company , like other multi-national companies, is
regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been
filed. Accordingly , tax liabilities are recorded when, in management’ s judgment, a tax position  does not meet the more likely than not
threshold for recognition . For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on
management’ s assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. The Company may also be subject to regulatory actions
related to these tax matters. The Company accrues liabilities for regulatory actions when a loss is probable and the amount or range of
loss is reasonably estimable.
Auditing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits and liabilities arising from regulatory actions related to transfer pricing used in
intercompany transactions was challenging because the measurement is based on judgmental interpretations of complex tax laws and
legal rulings  and because the pricing of the intercompany transactions is based on studies that may produce a range of outcomes (e.g.,
the price that would be charged in an arm’ s-length transaction).
How W e Addressed
the Matter in Our
AuditWe obtained an underst anding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’ s process to
assess the technical merits and measurement of these unrecognized tax benefits and related regulatory liabilities. For example, we tested
management’ s review of the unrecognized tax benefit calculations, which included evaluation of the comparable transactions used to
determine the ranges of outcomes, pricing conclusions reached in management’ s transfer pricin g studies, the assessment of other third-
party information, and settlement agreements with relevant tax and regulatory authorities.
With the assistance of our income tax profession als, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the technical
merits of the Company’ s position and assessing  the recognition and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits and liabilities resulting
from regulatory actions related to transfer pricing. For example, we assessed the inputs utilized and the pricing conclusions reached in the
transfer pricing studies executed by managemen t, and compared the methods used to alternativ e methods and industry benchmarks. We
reviewed advice obtaine d by the Company from third-party advisors. In addition, we used our knowledge of historical settlement activity ,
income tax laws, and other market information to evaluate the technical merits of the Comp any’s positions. For positions settled or
effectively settled in the current year, we reviewed the Company's communications and agreements with the relevant tax and regulatory
authorities. Where applicable, we requested and received an external legal counsel confirmation letter to independently verify our
understanding of settlement agreements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonald’ s Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited McDon ald’s Corporation’ s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,
McDonald’ s Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on
the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance
sheets of McDonald’ s Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
shareholders’  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 24,
2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’ s management is responsible for maintaining ef fective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the ef fectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’ s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. W e are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating ef fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. W e believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Controls and Procedures
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS
An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’ s management, including the Chief Executive Of ficer (“CEO”) and
Chief Financial Of ficer (“CFO”), of the ef fectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’ s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that
evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’ s disclosure controls and procedures were ef fective as of such date to provide reasonable
assurances that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to
the Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company is in the process of implementing a comprehensive, multi-year finance and technology transformation initiative to migrate its general ledger ,
financial close and consolidation processes onto new financial systems. The Company is performing the implementation in the ordinary course of business to
increase ef ficiency and to modernize the tools and technology used in its key financial processes. This is not in response to any identified deficiency or
weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. As the phased implementation of the systems continues, the Company has modified certain
processes and procedures to enhance the quality of internal control over financial reporting. The Company will continue to monitor and modify , as needed, the
design and operating ef fectiveness of key control activities to align with the updated business processes and capabilities of the new financial systems.
Except for these changes, the Company’ s management, including the CEO and CFO, confirm there has been no change in the Company's internal control
over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially af fected, or is reasonably likely to materially af fect, the Company's

McDONALD’S CORPORA TION
OFFICER SEVERANCE PLAN
ARTICLE I.
Statement of Purpose
McDonald’ s Corporation has established the Plan to provide financial assistance through severance payments and other benefits to
officers on the United States payroll who are subject to United States taxation and whose employment with an Employer hereunder
is terminated in a Covered Termination (as such capitalized terms are defined herein).
The Plan is not intended to be an “employee pension benefit plan” or “pension plan” within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA.
Rather , this Plan is intended to be a “welfare benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA  and to meet the descriptive
requirements of a plan constituting a “severance pay plan” within the meaning of regulations published by the Secretary of Labor at
Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 2510.3-2(b).
This document is a combined Plan document and summary plan description. The terms of this document apply to Covered
Terminations occurring on or after November 1, 2022. The payment of severance benefits to any Participant who had a Covered
Termination prior to November 1, 2022 shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the McDonald’ s Corporation Of ficer
Severance Plan in ef fect at the time of such Covered Termination. With respect to any Eligible Employee, the Plan as amended and
restated as of November 1, 2022 replaces any and all prior policies, plans, and arrangements (whether written or unwritten), to the
extent that such policies, plans, and arrangements provide for payments to be made after termination of employment directly by an
Employer; other than pursuant to an Employer retirement plan or arrangement or any individual employment, severance, or change
of control arrangement between the Employer and the Eligible Employee.

Eligibility
Section 3.1    General Eligibility Requir ements. To be eligible for Severance Benefits under the Plan, an Eligible Employee must:
(a) Permanently cease providing services to his or her Employer as a result of a Covered Termination;
5
(b) Receive a Termination Notice on or before the date he or she has a Separation from Service; and
(c) Remain actively and continuously employed in good standing with his or her Employer through his or her
Termination Date.
An Eligible Employee who is of fered or entitled to receive payments in the nature of severance pay under a Related Severance Plan
is not eligible for Severance Benefits under this Plan.
McDonald’ s Corporation shall establish procedures and processes for implementing Covered Terminations. These procedures and
processes may dif fer depending on the business needs and priorities of the af fected work unit. The fact that an Eligible Employee
receives notice of termination of employment, or an Eligible Employee’ s employment actually terminates, shall not automatically
entitle such Eligible Employee to be considered a Participant nor automatically cause such termination to be considered a Covered
Termination.
In the case of any Of ficer who is at the Executive Vice President level or above, the Compensation Committee shall determine in its
sole discretion whether such Of ficer shall be treated as a Participant and to what extent such Of ficer will be entitled to receive
Severance Benefits under this Plan. The determinations of the Compensation Committee shall be final and binding.
In addition, an Eligible Employee will not be eligible for Severance Benefits if he or she fails to return all property of the Employers
(including, without limitation, automobiles (unless previously purchased in accordance with Section 4.8), keys, credit cards,
documents and records, identification cards, equipment, phones, computers, etc.) within fifteen (15) days of the Eligible Employee’ s
Termination Date.
Section 3.2.    Release Agreement.  In order to be considered a Participant under the Plan following a Covered Termination, an
Eligible Employee is required to sign and return to McDonald’ s Corporation a release agreement (the “Release Agreement”) no later
than the date specified in the executable form of Release Agreement provided by McDonald’ s Corporation within a reasonable
period of time following the Eligible Employee’ s Termination Date. If an Eligible Employee revokes or rescinds the Release
Agreement before the end of any revocation period, the Eligible Employee will not be considered a Participant entitled to Severance
Benefits under the Plan. The Release Agreement may include, in the Plan Administrator ’s sole discretion, a covenant not to compete
with McDonald’ s Corporation or its Related Entities.
Except as provided in Section 5.1, no Severance Pay or sabbatical pay will be paid to an Eligible Employee unless and until the
Eligible Employee timely signs the Release Agreement in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator and the period of time for
revoking or rescinding such agreement under applicable law has expired without the Eligible Employee having revoked or rescinded
such agreement. Severance Benefits other than Severance Pay and sabbatical payments shall be provided to an Eligible Employee in
accordance with Article IV  until such time as the Eligible Employee either (a) fails to sign a Release Agreement within the time
specified above or (b) timely revokes or rescinds an executed Release Agreement. If an Eligible Employee fails to timely sign (and
not revoke or rescind) the Release Agreement, that Eligible
6
Employee shall cease to receive any further Severance Benefits under this Plan and shall repay McDonald’ s Corporation the cost of
any Severance Benefits previously received by the Eligible Employee. The Employers shall have the right to seek enforcement of
this repayment right in any court of competent jurisdiction.
If an Eligible Employee dies prior to signing the Release Agreement and the deadline for signing the Release Agreement has not
passed as of his or her date of death, the requirement for executing the Release Agreement shall pass to the decedent’ s beneficiary
(as defined in Section 7.1).
ARTICLE IV .
Severance Benefits
Section 4.1.    In General. Each Participant shall be entitled to Severance Pay and other Severance Benefits in accordance with this
Article IV  and Article V below , together with the Schedules included in Appendix II to this Plan. Except as provided in Section 5.2,
to the extent there is any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and an applicable Schedule, the provisions of the Schedule shall
control. If a Participant would be covered by both (i) Schedule A and (ii) one of the Schedules dealing with special circumstances
(Schedule B or C), then Schedule B or C, as applicable, shall be the only Schedule that applies to that Participant.

Section 4.3.    Medical, Dental, and Vision Coverage.  Except as provided otherwise in an applicable Schedule, if a Participant is
eligible to elect continuation coverage under COBRA  in accordance with the terms of the medical, dental, and/or vision plan of the
Employer and properly and timely elects such continuation coverage, the Employer shall provide subsidized COBRA  coverage
during the COBRA  Severance Period. During such period, the Employer shall pay on behalf of the Participant an amount equal to
the dif ference between (i) the premiums the employee would have paid for active coverage if he or she had remained employed and
(ii) the COBRA  Premiums. The Employer ’s payments shall be made to the entity funding the applicable plan coverage and not
directly to the Participant. The Participant must pay his or her share of the COBRA  Premiums and may not have the premium cost
withheld from the Severance Pay nor contributed to any cafeteria plan or flexible spending account. After the COBRA  Severance
Period ends, the Participant shall be responsible for paying the full cost of any remaining COBRA  coverage at the rate of 102% of
the full COBRA  Premium cost ( i.e., 102% of both the employee and the employer premium costs). The Employers shall not pay any
portion of the COBRA  Premiums for longer than the COBRA  Severance Period, regardless of whether the Participant or his or her
eligible dependents have an additional qualifying event under

COBRA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if COBRA  is no longer required to be provided to a Participant under the federal laws
governing COBRA, all payments of COBRA  Premiums for that Participant under this Plan will also end.
Section 4.4.    Transitional Assistance. The Employers shall provide each Participant with transitional assistance if and only to the
extent set forth in the applicable Schedule. The Participant must start the transitional assistance process within sixty (60) days of the
Termination Date. In no event shall any Participant be entitled to receive cash or other benefits in lieu of such transitional assistance.
Section 4.5.    Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units.  Any equity compensation (including, without limitation, stock options
and restricted stock units) granted to a Participant under any equity incentive plan maintained by McDonald’ s Corporation shall be
treated in accordance with the terms of the equity incentive plan, prospectus, and grant applicable to such equity compensation.
Section 4.6.    Sabbatical. A Participant shall receive a lump sum sabbatical payment equal to eight weeks of Weekly Base Pay if:
(a) the Participant was entitled to take a sabbatical leave immediately before his or her Termination Date; or (b) the Participant was
eligible for McDonald’ s Corporation’ s sabbatical program and the Termination Date occurs on or after the ninth, nineteenth, twenty-
ninth, thirty-ninth, etc. anniversary of the Participant’ s Company Service Date but before the beginning of the year in which the
Participant would have become entitled to take a sabbatical leave. In no event shall a Participant receive more than one sabbatical
payment or more than a total of eight weeks of Weekly Base Pay under this Section 4.6.
Section 4.7.    Pr orated TIP Bonuses.  A Participant who is TIP-Eligible shall also be eligible to receive a Prorated TIP payment, if
the Participant terminated employment on or after March 1 of a calendar year . The Prorated TIP payment shall be prorated based on
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from January 1 through the Termination Date in the calendar year and the
denominator of which is 365 (or 366 in a leap year). The Prorated TIP payment shall be based on the actual performance of
McDonald’ s Corporation and its subsidiaries and business units during the annual performance period and shall be subject to
supervisory discretion for the individual performance factor . The Prorated TIP payment will be made at the same time TIP payments
are made to active employees.
Section 4.8.    Company Vehicle. A Participant who has a company-provided vehicle may purchase it and, in certain cases, may
receive a prorated cash reimbursement for recent upgrades related to such vehicle, as determined by McDonald’ s Fleet Management
Department and the terms of the McDonald’ s Corporation Vehicle Program applicable to the Participant. In no event will the initial
salary reduction paid by the Participant be refunded or repaid to the Participant.
In order to exercise the right to purchase his or her company-provided vehicle, a Participant must provide notice of such exercise and
complete the purchase in accordance with the procedures determined by McDonald’ s Fleet Management Department, but in no event
may the purchase take place before his or her Release Date. If the Participant’ s Termination Date occurs before his or her Release
Date, the Participant must return his or her company-provided vehicle on his or
8
her Termination Date, and the vehicle shall be returned to him or her when such purchase can be completed.
Section 4.9.    Timing Rules for  Certain Reimbursements and Payments. Officer level employees are entitled to reimbursement
for certain financial planning expenses for the year in which their Termination Date occurs. The financial planning services must be
both completed and submitted for reimbursement within three months after the Participant’ s Termination Date or , if earlier , by the
last day of the year in which the Termination Date occurs. Expenses submitted after this date will not be reimbursed. Of ficers who
are entitled to executive physicals must complete their physical within six months of the Participant’ s Termination Date. If a
Participant’ s spouse is also eligible for a physical, the spouse also must complete the physical within six months of the Participant’ s
Termination Date.

Section 6.3.    Continuation and Conversion Rights. On a Participant’ s Termination Date, all benefit plans, policies, fringe
benefits, and pay practices in which the Participant was participating shall cease to apply to the Participant in accordance with the
terms of such benefits plans, policies, procedures, and practices, as applicable and in accordance with the requirements of any
applicable law , unless such benefits are specifically continued as a Severance Benefit under this Plan. Any benefit continuation or
conversion rights to which a Participant is entitled as of his or her Termination Date shall be made available to him or her .

Participant began to attend before his or her Termination Notice Date; provided that the Participant complies with all requirements

sabbatical pay shall be made to the Participant’ s spouse if the Participant is married as of the date of his or her death or otherwise to

the Participant is rehired and he or she shall repay the portion, if any , of the Severance Pay previously received by the Participant

the portion of any Severance Pay to be received or retained and the portion of any Severance Pay to be repaid pursuant to this
Section 7.2 shall be determined based on the number of full and fractional Weeks of Severance, if any , attributable to the applicable
period. For an Executive Participant, the portion of any Severance Pay to be received or retained and the portion of any Severance

conclusive for all questions concerning administration of the Plan.
The Plan Administrator may delegate to other persons responsibilities for performing certain of the duties of the Plan Administrator
under the terms of the Plan and may seek such expert advice as the Plan Administrator deems reasonably necessary with respect to
the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall be entitled to rely upon the information and advice furnished by such delegates and experts,
unless the Plan Administrator has actual knowledge that such information and advice is inaccurate or unlawful. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Compensation Committee shall have the final authority with respect to all Severance Benefits under the Plan for any
Officer at the Executive Vice President level or above.
Section 9.2.    Plan Information.
Name of Plan: McDonald’ s Corporation Of ficer Severance Plan

Agent for Service of Process: The Chief Legal Of ficer and Secretary of McDonald’ s Corporation is designated as agent for
service of legal process. Notice to the Chief Legal Of ficer and Secretary should be addressed to McDonald’ s Corporation c/o Chief
Legal Of ficer and

The Employer Identification Number (“EIN”) assigned by the Internal Revenue Service to McDonald’ s Corporation is 36-
2361282.
The Plan is funded through the general assets of McDonald’ s Corporation.
Section 9.3.    ERISA  Rights. A Participant in the Plan is entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA. ERISA  provides
that Participants shall be entitled to:
(a) Examine, without char ge, at the Plan Administrator ’s office and at other specified locations, such as worksites, all
documents governing the Plan, including insurance contracts and collective bar gaining agreements, and a copy of the
latest annual report (Form 5500 series) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the
Public Disclosure Room of the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration.
(b) Obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator , copies of documents governing the operation of the Plan . The
administrator may make a reasonable char ge for the copies.
In addition to creating rights for Plan Participants, ERISA  imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of
the employee benefit Plan. The people who operate the Plan, called “fiduciaries” of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in
the interest of Plan Participants and beneficiaries. No one, including an Employer or any other person, may fire or otherwise
discriminate against employees in any way to prevent someone from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising their rights under
ERISA.
If a Participant’ s claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, the Participant has a right to know why this was
done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without char ge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time
schedules.
Under ERISA, there are steps Participants can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if a Participant requests a copy of Plan
documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and does not receive them within 30 days, he or she may file suit in a Federal
court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay the Participant up to $1 10 a day
until the Participant receives the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the
administrator . If a Participant has a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, he or she may file suit in a state
or Federal court. Additional information on claims is provided in Article X (“Claims Procedure”). If it should happen that Plan
fiduciaries misuse the Plan’ s money or a Participant is discriminated against for asserting his or her rights, a Participant may seek
assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor , or file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and
legal fees. If the Participant is successful the court may order the person the Participant has sued to pay these costs and fees. If the
Participant loses, the court may order the Participant to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds the Participant’ s claim is
frivolous.
14
Any questions about the Plan should be directed to the Plan Administrator . If a Participant has any questions about this statement or
about his or her rights under ERISA, or if he or she needs assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator , the
Participant should contact the nearest of fice of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor , listed in
a telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S.
Department of Labor , 200 Constitution Avenue N.W ., Washington, D.C. 20210. Participants may also obtain certain publications
about their rights and responsibilities under ERISA  by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security
Administration.

(1)The nonoperating income (expense) amount presented in 2022 excludes $537.2 million of expense related to the settlement of a tax audit in France.
(2)The Operating lease interest is calculated using the Short-term and Long-term Lease liability amount multiplied by 3.5%, 3.7% and 3.8% for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rates represent the Company's weighted average discount rate used for leases that represents an estimate of the interest rate the
Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of the lease within a particular currency environment.
(3)Calculated using the effective income tax rate for each year presented. The 2022 and 2021 amounts are calculated using the non-GAAP tax rates of 20.1% and 21.1%
respectively.
(4)The amounts for each year presented are calculated as the simple average of each of the previous four quarters.(1)

Reconciliation of Returns on Incremental Invested Capital
ROIIC is a measure that evaluates the overall profitability of our markets and the ef fectiveness of capital deployed over one-year and three-year time periods.
This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is
the Company’ s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period.
The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used
for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter ’s
investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2022 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have
only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2022 investing activities are included in the
one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2021 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months
ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2022 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2021
investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter ,
resulting in a weighted-average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented. Management believes that weighting cash used
for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average.
The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and
denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows:
