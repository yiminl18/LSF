PART I
Item 1. - Business
The Company
Amcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a holding company incorporated under the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey in
July, 2018, in order to effect the Company's combination with Bemis Company, Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed "Amcor plc" and became a public
limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey.
Bemis Company, Inc. Merger
On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products, pursuant to the definitive merger
agreement (the "Agreement") between Amcor Limited and Bemis dated August 6, 2018. Under the terms of the Agreement, Bemis shareholders received 5.1 Amcor shares for each
share of Bemis stock and Amcor shareholders received one Amcor CHESS Depositary Instrument ("CDI") for each share of Amcor Limited stock issued and outstanding. Upon
completion of the transaction, the Amcor shares were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
under the symbol "AMCR" and the CDI's representing our shares on the Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX") are traded under the symbol "AMC." In addition, Amcor Limited
shares were delisted from the ASX and Bemis shares were delisted from the NYSE.
    
Business Strategy
Strategy
Our strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differentiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company. To fulfill our
aspiration, we are determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders and the environment.
Focused portfolio
Our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics:
•a focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,
•good industry structure,
•attractive relative growth, and
•multiple paths for us to win from our leadership position, scale and other competitive advantages.
These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closures.
Differentiated capabilities
'The Amcor Way' describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent, Commercial Excellence,
Operational Leadership, Innovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline.
Shareholder value creation
Through our portfolio of business and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior customer value. The
defensive nature of our end markets mean that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Through paying dividends and growing the
base business organically in a defensive set of end markets, pursuing acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders, over time value creation has been strong and consistent.
6
Segment Information
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting," establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In
applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, the Company has determined it has two reporting segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reporting segments produce flexible
packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North
America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to Note 20, "Segments," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about business
segments.
Flexibles Segment
The Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 43,000 employees at 190 facilities in 38 countries as of June 30, 2019, the
Flexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic, aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2019, Flexibles accounted for approximately 70% of
the Company’s consolidated net sales.
Rigid Packaging Segment
The Rigid Packaging Segment is one of the world's largest manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and related products. As of June 30, 2019, the Rigid Packaging Segment
employed approximately 6,000 employees at 60 facilities in 12 countries. In fiscal year 2019, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 30% of the Company’s consolidated net
sales.
Marketing, Distribution, and Competition
Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but primarily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North
America, Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by
product development engineers, design technicians, field service technicians, and a customer service organization.
Sales to PepsiCo, and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11.1%, 11.0% and 11.7% of our sales in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Business
arrangements with PepsiCo are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these business arrangements would typically occur over a
period of time.
The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality,
and price. Competitors include Aptar Group, Inc., Ball Corporation, Berry Global, Inc., CCL Industries, Inc., Crown Holdings Incorporated, Graphic Packaging International, Inc.,
Huhtamaki Oyj, International Paper Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, Owens-Illinois Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings, Inc., Sonoco Products Company, Westrock
Company, Winpack, Ltd., and a variety of privately held companies.
We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we serve; however, due to the diversity of our business, our precise competitive position in
these markets is not reasonably determinable.
Backlog
Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable
balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders.
Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which we operate.
Raw Materials
Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchased from a variety of global industry
sources, and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials may occur, we expect to
continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions. Currently, raw materials are readily available but pricing can fluctuate.
Intellectual Property
7
We are the owner or licensee of a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to certain of our products, manufacturing processes, and
equipment. We have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade
secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse
effect on our results as a whole or those of our segments.
Environmental Matters and Government Regulation
We believe our commitment to responsible packaging is integral to our success. Responsible packaging protects the product, extends its shelf life and can reduce a
significant amount of waste throughout the supply chain.
In January 2018, we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increase our
use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world. We are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the development of more
sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging.
Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations pertain
to the discharge of certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water as well as various other protections
of the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our Environmental, Health, and
Safety Management System and regular audits of those processes and systems. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future incur liability with respect to
noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior
owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, which could be material. In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we
cannot always anticipate these changes. Refer to Note 19, "Contingencies and Legal Proceedings," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about legal
proceedings. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors".
Employees
As of June 30, 2019, we employed approximately 50,000 people worldwide.
Seasonal Factors
The business of each of the reporting segments is not seasonal to any material extent.
Research and Development
Refer to Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for research and development expenditures.

Item 1A. - Risk Factors
The following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, or in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not
material could also effect our business operations and financial results.
Strategic Risks
Changes in Consumer Demand — We are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries.
    Sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers. Consequently, changes in consumer preferences for products in the
industries that we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered, whether as a result of changes in cost, convenience or health, environmental and social
concerns and perceptions, may result in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products. Although we have adopted certain
strategies designed to mitigate the impact of declining sales, there is no guarantee that such strategies will be successful or will offset a decline in demand. Furthermore, any new
products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors, including our inability to accurately predict customer demand, end user preferences or
movements in industry standards or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely and cost-effective manner.
Changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce. However, to the extent changing preferences are
not offset by demand for new or alternative products, changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of
operations.
Key Customers and Customer Consolidation — The loss of key customers, a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation among key customers could have a
significant adverse impact on our sales revenue and profitability.
Relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success, particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply choices available to
customers. From time to time, a single customer, depending on the current status and volumes of a number of separate contracts in disparate locations, may account for 10% or more
of our revenue. Sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately 11% of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. We did not have any other customer account for
more than 10% of net sales in these fiscal periods.
Customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain business units. Consequently, the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their
production requirements, or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them, could reduce our sales revenue and net profit.
There can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors, change to alternative forms
of packaging, begin manufacturing their packaging products in-house or seek to renew their business with us on terms less favorable than before.
Any loss, change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of
operations, which effect may be material.
In addition, over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the
concentration of our business with these customers. Such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume
of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. While we have generally been successful at managing
customer consolidations, increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Competition — We face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business.
We operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas, each with varying barriers to entry, industry structures and competitive behavior. We regularly bid for new
and continuing business in the industries and regions in which
9
we operate and we continue to change in response to consumer demand. We cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competitiveness.
The loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may have a significant impact on our operating results. In addition, our
competitors may develop disruptive technology or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers. No assurance
can be given that the actions of established or potential competitors will not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business, cash flow, financial
condition and results of operations.
Synergy Benefits — The failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Bemis.
We anticipate that the transaction will generate estimated pre-tax annual net cost synergies by the end of the third year of approximately $180 million from procurement,
manufacturing and general and administrative efficiencies. However, we must successfully integrate our businesses in a manner that permits these anticipated benefits to be realized.
If we are not able to successfully achieve this, the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected or involve
more costs to do so.
Integration Risk — The failure to successfully integrate the business and operations of Bemis in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results.
Historically, Amcor Limited and Bemis were independent companies. While we have dedicated teams working on integrating our two operations, there can be no assurance
that our businesses will be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of either or
both companies’ ongoing businesses, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than
originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in integrating our operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction:
•Combining both businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the net cost synergies anticipated to result from the transaction, the failure of which would result in the
anticipated benefits of the transaction not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;
•combining our operations and corporate functions;
•integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers;
•identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets;
•harmonizing the companies’ operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal control and other policies, procedures and processes;
•maintaining existing agreements with customers and suppliers and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers and suppliers;
•addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;
•consolidating our administrative and information technology infrastructure;
•managing the movement of certain positions to different locations; and
•effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.
In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our company and resources may be focused on the integration of the business and diverted from day-to-day business
operations, which may disrupt our business.
Expanding Our Current Business — We may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth, including by product innovation, or
acquisitions.
Our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations, particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand relationships with customers in
emerging markets, product innovation, and expansion through acquisitions. However, we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our
control. Our ability to grow organically may be limited by, among other things, extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’
growth plans due to changing economic conditions, strategic priorities or otherwise. For many of our businesses, organic growth depends on product innovation, new product
development and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences. Consequently, failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer
preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential, affect our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
10
Additionally, over the past decade, we have pursued growth through acquisitions, including our recent transaction with Bemis Company, Inc. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets in the right geographic regions in the future and with the right participation strategy, or to complete such acquisitions on
acceptable terms or at all. Other companies in the industries and regions in which we operate have similar investment and acquisition strategies to us, resulting in competition for a
limited pool of potential acquisition targets. Due in part to that competition, as well as the recent low interest rate environment, which has made debt funding more appealing and
accessible, price multiples for potential targets are currently higher than their historical averages. If, as a result of these and other factors, we are unable to identify acquisition targets
that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms, our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted, which could have an adverse
effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting
expected financial benefits.
Intellectual Property — Challenges to or the loss of our intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively.
Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. We own a
number of patents on our products, aspects of our products, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing, and we own, or have licenses to use, the material trademark and trade
name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary
technology. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of
the countries in which we operate, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization,
independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with us. Furthermore, many of the countries in which we operate, particularly the
emerging markets, do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the more developed jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the
United States and the European Union. The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce certain of our competitive advantages, cause us
to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. The costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business. Similarly, while we have
not received any significant claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will not receive
such claims in the future. If we were held liable for a claim of infringement, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products.
Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management, may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary
technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any
such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Failure to protect our patents, trademarks and other
intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
Operational Risks
Global Operations — Challenging current and future global economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business operations and
financial results.
Demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products, including packaged food, beverage, healthcare, personal care,
agribusiness, industrial, and other consumer goods. As a result, general economic downturns in our key geographic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations
and financial results. The current global economic challenges, including relatively high levels of unemployment in certain areas in which we operate, low economic growth and
difficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and related economic volatility in certain economies, are likely to continue to put pressure on the global economy and our
business. In addition, we have recently experienced challenging conditions in parts of South America, where economic conditions have been mixed, and in particular in Argentina,
where we have employed highly inflationary accounting for our local subsidiaries.
When challenging economic conditions exist, our customers may delay, decrease or cancel purchases from us, and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether.
Suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to customers, which may affect our ability to meet customer demands, and
result in a loss of business. Weakened global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins. All of
these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material.
Political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic conditions in one or more markets in which we operate. For example, the formal process for the United
Kingdom leaving the European Union has resulted in uncertainty
11
regarding the long-term nature of the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union, causing significant volatility in global financial markets and altering the conduct of
market participants. Political developments such as this could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and may cause us to lose
customers, suppliers and employees, and adversely impact profitability.
International Operations — Our international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.
We have operations throughout the world, including facilities located in emerging markets. In fiscal year 2019, approximately 70% of our sales revenue came from
developed markets and 30% came from emerging markets. We expect to continue to expand our operations in the future, particularly in the emerging markets.
Management of global operations is extremely complex, particularly given the often substantial differences in the cultural, political and regulatory environments of the
countries in which we operate. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate, including Argentina, Brazil, China and India and other emerging markets, have
underdeveloped or developing legal, regulatory or political systems, which are subject to dynamic change and civil unrest.
The profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by, among other things:
•changes in applicable fiscal or regulatory regimes;
•changes in, or difficulties in interpreting and complying with, local laws and regulations, including tax, labor, foreign investment and foreign exchange control
laws;
•nullification, modification or renegotiation of, or difficulties or delays in enforcing, contracts with clients or joint venture partners that are subject to local law;
•reversal of current political, judicial or administrative policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade, or relating to the use of local agents, representatives
or partners in the relevant jurisdictions; or
•changes in exchange rates and inflation.
Further, sustained periods of legal, regulatory or political instability in the emerging markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow,
financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material.
The international scope of our operations, which includes limited sales of our products to entities located in countries subject to certain economic sanctions administered by
the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other applicable national and supranational
organizations (collectively, ‘‘Sanctions’’), and operations in certain countries that are from time to time subject to Sanctions, also requires us to maintain internal processes and
control procedures. Failure to do so could result in breach by our employees of various laws and regulations, including those relating to money laundering, corruption, export control,
fraud, bribery, insider trading, antitrust, competition and economic sanctions, whether due to a lack of integrity or awareness or otherwise. Any such breach could have an adverse
effect on our financial condition and result in reputational damage to our business, which effect may be material.
Raw Materials — Price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials, energy and other inputs could adversely affect our business.
As a manufacturer of packaging products, our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and other inputs, including energy.
All of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and films, aluminum and fiber-based carton board. Prices for these
raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, currency and commodity price fluctuations,
resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, political unrest and instability, and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures.
Increases in costs can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies, including by entering into
contracts with certain customers which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs or by otherwise seeking to increase our prices to offset increases in
raw material costs, there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate or mitigate commodity and input price movements, there may be delays in adjusting prices to correspond
with underlying raw material costs and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against such movements could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and
results of operations, which effect may be material.
12
Supply shortages or disruptions in our supply chains, including as a result of sourcing materials from a single supplier, could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of
raw materials, equipment and other supplies, and in turn, adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our
business and financial results.
Commercial Risks — We are subject to production, supply and other commercial risks, including counterparty credit risks, which may be exacerbated in times of economic
downturn.
We face a number of commercial risks, including (i) operational disruption, such as mechanical or technology failures, each of which could, in turn, lead to production loss
and/or increased costs, (ii) shortages in manufacturing inputs due to the loss of key suppliers and (iii) risks associated with development projects (such as cost overruns and delays).
In addition, many of the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, snow storms,
hurricanes, forest fires and flooding. Any unplanned plant downtime at any of our facilities would likely result in unabsorbed fixed costs that could negatively impact our results of
operations for the period in which it experienced the downtime.
Additionally, the insolvency of, or contractual default by, any of our customers, suppliers and financial institutions, such as banks and insurance providers, may have a
significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Such risks are exacerbated in times of economic volatility, either globally or in the geographies and industries in
which our customers operate. If a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us, we may be unable to collect the amounts owed and some or all of these outstanding amounts
may need to be written off. If a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in connection with a particular project, we may need to find a
replacement to fulfill that party’s obligations or, alternatively, fulfill those obligations ourself, which is likely to be more expensive. The occurrence of any of these risks, including
any default by our counterparties, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material and result in a
competitive disadvantage.
Information technology — A failure or disruption in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations, compromise customer, employee, vendor and other data
and could negatively effect our business.
We rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and control systems to securely manage operations and various business functions,
and on various technologies to process, store and report information about our business, and to interact with customers, vendors and employees around the world. In addition, our
information systems increasingly rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures. These measures cover technical changes to our network security, organization
and governance changes as well as alignment of third party vendors on market standards. As with all large systems, our information technology systems may be susceptible to
damage, disruption, information loss or shutdown due to power outages, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-
attacks, catastrophic events, telecommunications failures, user errors, unauthorized access and malicious or accidental destruction or theft of information or functionality.
We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls.
Despite our efforts to protect such information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches,
misplaced or lost data and programming and/or user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information. Information system
damages, disruptions, shutdowns or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions, transaction errors, loss of customers and business opportunities,
violation of privacy laws and legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, negative publicity resulting in reputational damage, reimbursement or compensatory payments
and other costs, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which affect may be material and result in a
competitive disadvantage. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, our systems, networks, products, and services remain potentially
vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats.
Attracting and retaining key personnel — If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may be adversely affected.
Our continued success depends, in large part, on our ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel in key functions and geographic areas. Losing
the services of key employees in any of our operations could make it difficult to meet our objectives. There can be no assurance we will be able to recruit, train, assimilate, motivate
and retain employees in the future who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture.
13
Operational hazards — We are subject to costs and liabilities related to current and future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that could adversely affect
our business.
We are required to comply with environmental and health and safety laws, rules and regulations in each of the countries in which we do business. Many of our products
come into contact with the food and beverages they package and therefore we are also subject to certain local and international standards related to such products. Compliance with
these laws and regulations can require significant expenditure of financial and employee resources.
In addition, changes to such laws, regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly, and some of the proposals, if adopted, might, directly or indirectly, result in a
material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. For instance, an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related
recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials.
Additionally, increased regulation of emissions linked to climate change, including greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions and other climate-related regulations, could potentially
increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance (which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices), increased cost of fossil fuel inputs and
increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs. However, any such changes are uncertain, and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating
expenses that would be necessary for compliance.
Federal, state, provincial, foreign and local environmental requirements relating to air, soil and water quality, handling, discharge, storage and disposal of a variety of
substances and climate change are also significant factors in our business and changes to such requirements generally result in an increase to our costs of operations. We may be
found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is, or was, contaminated by us or a third party at various facilities we own, used or operate
(including facilities that may be acquired by us in the future). Legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties, as well as mandated remediation programs, that
require substantial, and in some instances, unplanned capital expenditure.
The effects of climate change and greenhouse gas effects may adversely affect our business. A number of governmental bodies have introduced, or are contemplating
introducing, regulatory change to address the impacts of climate change, which, where implemented, may have adverse impacts on our operations or financial results.
We have incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, fines, penalties and legal costs relating to environmental matters, and costs relating to the damage of natural
resources, lost property values and toxic tort claims. Provisions are raised when it is considered probable that we have some liability. However, because the extent of potential
environmental damage, and the extent of our liability for such damage, is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of time, our actual liability in
such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently provisioned amount. Accordingly, additional charges could be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our
operating results and financial position, which may be material.
Labor disputes — We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which could adversely affect our business.
Although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in recent years, there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disputes in the future, including
protests and strikes, which could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation. Although we consider our relations with our
employees to be good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees in the future.
Financial Risks
LIBOR Indexed Borrowings — Our financing agreements may need to be renegotiated if LIBOR ceases to exist.
A substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). In July 2017, the United
Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in
conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing LIBOR with the Secured
Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities.
Certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for LIBOR, if necessary. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to
renegotiate some financing agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize
14
LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, however, we are not
able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a
possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Exchange Rates — We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk.
We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk, both transactional and translational, which may negatively affect our financial performance. Transactional foreign exchange
exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations, including in respect of the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Brazilian real, and other currencies in which our costs are denominated, which
may affect our business input costs and proceeds from product sales. Translational foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of entity
functional currencies to U.S. dollars, consistent with our reporting currency, and may affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities and our income and expenses. In particular,
our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the exchange rate between the Euro and the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate has varied in
recent years and is subject to further movement.
Exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly. For instance, the peso, the real, the ruble and the yuan have experienced significant pressures as
growth and other concerns have weighed on the Argentine, Brazilian, Russian and Chinese economies, respectively. To the extent currency depreciation continues across our
business, we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through U.S. dollar-denominated input costs across our business, which would adversely impact our margins and
profitability. As such, we may be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations, and such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our reported cash flow, financial condition and
results of operations, which effect may be material.
Interest rates — An increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations.
At June 30, 2019, our variable rate borrowings approximated $4.0 billion (which includes $841.0 million fixed rate notes that have been effectively converted to variable
rate debt through the use of a fixed to variable interest rate swap). Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations.
Accordingly, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, our annual interest
expense would increase by approximately $40.0 million on the $4.0 billion of variable rate debt outstanding as of June 30, 2019.
Credit rating — A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
In addition to using cash provided by operations, we regularly issue commercial paper to meet our short-term liquidity needs. Our credit ratings are important to our ability
to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. A downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost of borrowing or the fees associated with our bank credit facility, or
the credit spread incurred when issuing long-term debt in the capital markets.
Hedging — Failure to hedge effectively against adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations.
We are subject to the risk of rising interest rates associated with borrowing on a floating-rate basis as well as unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our board
of directors has approved a hedging policy to manage the risk of rising interest rates. The level of hedging activity undertaken may change from time to time and we may elect to
change our hedging policy at any time. If our hedges are not effective in mitigating our interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risks, if we are under-hedged or if a hedge
provider defaults on our obligations under hedging arrangements, it could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
Goodwill and other intangible assets — A significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of
operations and net worth.
We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards. These
methods include the use of a weighted-average cost of capital to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of
capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to
write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes in
15
our business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations, we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles, which would
lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of
operations and net worth. We have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments—Intangible assets and goodwill” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.
Financial Controls and Reporting Systems — Significant demands will be placed on our financial controls and reporting systems as a result of the acquisition of Bemis.
There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with our acquisition of Bemis and
significant demands will be placed on our managerial, operational and financial personnel and systems. Our future operating results may be affected by the ability of our officers and
key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement, expand and revise our operational and financial controls and reporting systems in response to the
transaction. For example, while Bemis prepared its financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), we have historically prepared
our financial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards ("AAS") and the combined company will now prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The revisions required to consolidate the financial reporting system and to switch reporting systems to U.S. GAAP has placed significant demands on our financial controls
and reporting systems.
Furthermore, we are required to comply with different rules and regulations from those that previously applied to us, including the rules and regulations of the SEC, the
reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the listed rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the application of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). Complying with the applicable rules and regulations has and will result in an increase in legal and financial compliance costs and also has made certain
activities more time-consuming and costly.
    
Internal Controls — If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
As a newly listed NYSE public company, we have elected the transition period for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires us to
furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material
weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control that
results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. However, during our transition period, we are exempted from compliance with Section 404. We are exempt from Section 404 compliance until we file our second Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.
Amcor Limited was required to comply with reporting obligations in Australia including the preparation of its financial statements under AAS as adopted by the Australian
Accounting Standards Board and other relevant companies law. Amcor Limited was not required to comply with U.S. GAAP. Following the consummation of the Bemis acquisition,
we now prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of
our historical AAS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. The first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of
experience in technical accounting in U.S. GAAP and disclosure and filing requirements of a U.S. domestic registrant. We are currently in the process of remediating this material
weakness and have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes of the material weakness. We have hired additional financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP
technical accounting and financial reporting experience, aligned our accounting policies and procedures with U.S. GAAP, enhanced our internal review procedures during the
financial close process, and begun technical training for accounting and finance personnel.
We also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end financial reporting
process. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation
and reporting of financial information.
16
To address the second material weakness, we have commenced a process to (i) identify those internal controls requiring improved documentation of independent review
over the completeness and accuracy of financial information under U.S. GAAP, (ii) implement enhanced standards designed to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (iii)
review the design of applicable internal controls and assess any required amendments and (iv) increase the training of accounting and finance staff in relevant areas.
We believe that these enhanced resources and processes, including the implementation of new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the material weaknesses, but
the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded, through testing, that these controls
are designed and operating effectively. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 at the end of our transition period, or if we or our registered public
accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to
sanctions by regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.
    
Insurance — Our insurance policies, including our use of a captive insurance company, may not provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face.
We seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures through the purchase of insurance. A significant portion of our insurance is placed in the insurance
market with third-party re-insurers. Our policies with such third-party re-insurers cover property damage and business interruption, public and products liability and directors' and
officers' liability. Although Amcor believes the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry practice, they may not adequately cover certain risks and there is no
guarantee that any claims made under such policies will ultimately be paid.
Additionally, Amcor retains a portion of Amcor's insurable risk through a captive insurance company, Amcor Insurances Pte Ltd, which is located in Singapore. Amcor's
captive insurance company collects annual premiums from Amcor's business groups, and assumes specific risks relating to property damage, business interruption and liability
claims. The captive insurance company may be required to make payment for insurance claims which exceed the captive's reserves, which could have an adverse effect on Amcor's
business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
Legal and Compliance Risks
Litigation — Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.
We are, and in the future will likely become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of
our business. Given our global footprint, we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory
inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse
judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments. See “Legal Proceedings" included in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental, health, and safety regulations — Changing government regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters may adversely affect our company.
Numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about Greenhouse Gas emissions and climate change. We are a
manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemical-based raw materials to produce many of our products. Increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs
for us in the form of higher raw material cost, as well as energy and freight costs. It is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes. We
could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits. Additionally, a sizable portion of our business comes from
healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging, both highly regulated markets. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, our results of operations could be
adversely impacted.
Patents and proprietary technology — Our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to develop, acquire and retain intellectual
property rights.
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as
confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may
suffer. Our pending
17
patent applications, and our pending trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks. In
addition, our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may need to spend significant resources
monitoring our intellectual property rights. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all.
Competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and
our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues.
Risks Relating to Being a Jersey, Channel Islands Company Listing Ordinary Shares
Our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, which may not provide the level of legal certainty and transparency afforded by incorporation in a
U.S. jurisdiction and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other U.S. corporations.
We are organized under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of Normandy, France. Jersey is not a member
of the European Union. Jersey, Channel Islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on English corporate law principles. The rights of holders of our ordinary shares are
governed by Jersey law, including the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, and by the Amcor Articles of Association. These rights differ in some respects from the rights of
other shareholders in corporations incorporated in the United States. Further, there can be no assurance that the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, will not change in the future or that
they will serve to protect investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the U.S., which could adversely affect the rights of investors.
U.S. shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against us.
A significant portion of our assets are located outside of the United States and several of our directors and officers are citizens or residents of jurisdictions outside of the
United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service within the United States upon those directors and officers, or to realize in the United States upon
judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon our civil liability and our directors or officers under the U.S. federal securities laws.
Judgments of U.S. courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the U.S. and the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts outside of the U.S., including those in
Australia and Jersey, may be subject to limitations. Investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the U.S., including
Australia and Jersey, for liabilities under the securities laws of the U.S. Additionally, our Articles of Association provide that while the Royal Court of Jersey will have non-exclusive
jurisdiction over actions brought against us, the Royal Court of Jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions, actions for breach of fiduciary duty by
our directors and officers, actions arising out of Jersey Companies Law or actions asserting a claim against our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The
exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws from being raised in a U.S. court and would
not prevent a U.S. court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims. However, there is uncertainty whether a U.S. or Jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum provision for
actions for breach of fiduciary duty and other claims.

Overview
Amcor is a global packaging company with total sales of approximately $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2019. We employ approximately 50,000 people across approximately 250
sites in more than 40 countries, and are a leader in developing and producing a broad range of packaging products including flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons and
closures. In fiscal year 2019, the majority of sales were made to the defensive food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical device home and personal care, and other consumer goods
end markets.
Significant Items Affecting the Periods Presented
The Acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc.
On June 11, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Bemis Company, Inc ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible
packaging products based in the United States, for the purchase price of $5.2 billion in an all-stock transaction. In connection with the Bemis transaction, we assumed $1.4 billion of
debt.
2019 Bemis Integration Plan
In connection with the acquisition of Bemis, we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined
organization. As previously announced, we continue to target realizing approximately $180 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain and general and
administrative savings by the end of fiscal year 2022. The total cash costs are estimated at $150 million with estimated total pre-tax costs of $200 million. The 2019 Bemis
Integration Plan is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2022. There were no cash payments associated with the plan in fiscal year 2019.
    
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we incurred $47.9 million of pre-tax restructuring expenses related to this Plan, primarily related to employee termination costs. Initial actions
include the planned closure of three sites. We expect to finalize the major components of the Plan by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Other Restructuring Plans
On August 21, 2018, the Company announced a restructuring program in our Rigid Packaging reporting segment aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the
footprint ("2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan"). The program includes the closure of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint
optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost reductions.
The Company's total pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $95.0 million with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing facilities and
employee related costs. The total plan cost has been increased by approximately $25.0 million in the fourth quarter due to additional opportunities that have been identified. The
Company estimates that approximately $65.0 million of the $95.0 million total costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 were
$30.3 million. The 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2020.
On June 9, 2016, the Company announced a major initiative ("2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the Flexibles
segment. This initiative was designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with
demand, increase utilization and improve the cost base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed
to market.
As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, the Company has closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. The Company's total
pre-tax restructuring costs were approximately $230.8 million, with approximately $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and
$32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to dismantle equipment and terminate existing lease contracts. The Company estimates that approximately $166.2
million of the $230.8 million total costs have resulted in cash expenditures. Cash payments in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 were $14.4 million. The Plan is substantially
completed by the end of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
Impairment in Equity Method Investment
23
Due to impairment indicators present for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company performed impairment tests by comparing the carrying value of its
investment in AMVIG Holdings Limited ("AMVIG") at the end of each period, including interim periods, to the fair value of the investment, which was determined based on
AMVIG's quoted share price. The Company recorded impairment charges in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 of $14.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, as the fair value of the
investment was below its carrying value. The Company did not record an impairment charge in 2017 as the fair value of the investment was above its carrying value. Refer to Note 7,
"Equity Method Investments" for more information about the Company's equity method investments.
High Inflation Accounting
The Company has subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a functional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine economy was designated as
highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, the Company began reporting the financial results of its Argentinean subsidiaries with a functional
currency of the Argentine Peso at the functional currency of the parent, which is the U.S. dollar. The transition to highly inflationary accounting resulted in a negative impact of
$30.2 million that was reflected on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended June 30, 2019.
Results of Operations

(in millions)  2019  2018  2017
Net sales  $ 9,458.2 $ 9,319.1 $ 9,101.0
Operating income  791.7 993.9 916.1
Operating profit as a percentage of net sales  8.4% 10.7% 10.1%
       
Net income attributable to Amcor plc  $ 430.2 $ 575.2 $ 564.0
Diluted EPS  $ 0.36 $ 0.49 $ 0.48
2019 versus 2018
Net sales increased $139.1 million, or 1.5%, to $9.5 billion for the fiscal year 2019, from $9.3 billion for the fiscal year 2018. The impact of currency translation resulted in
a decrease of $368.9 million or 4.0%, somewhat offset by Bemis sales for the partial month of June of $215.4 million. The growth in the legacy Amcor net sales revenue excluding
currency impact of $292.6m or 3.1% was driven largely by favorable pricing of 2.3%, mainly from passing through higher raw material costs and inflation related costs in both the
Flexibles and Rigid Packaging reporting segments and volume/mix impacts of 0.8%.
Net income attributable to Amcor plc decreased by $145.0 million, or 25.2%, to $430.2 million for the fiscal year 2019, from $575.2 million for the fiscal year 2018. Net
income for fiscal year 2019 was impacted by material acquisitions and other costs of $143.1 million, Rigid Packaging reporting segment restructuring expense of $64.1 million,
highly inflationary accounting impacts of $30.2 million and other non-recurring items. Adjusted net income of $729.5 million excluding these non-recurring items was up 4.6% on a
reported basis and 9% after excluding the impact of currency.
Diluted EPS decreased to $0.36 for the fiscal year 2019, from $0.49 for the fiscal year 2018, with net income attributable to ordinary shareholders decreasing 25.2% and the
diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding increased 1.9%. EPS was impacted by the after tax impact of the non-recurring items referred to above.
2018 versus 2017
Net sales increased $218.1 million, or 2.4%, to $9.3 billion for the fiscal year 2018, from $9.1 billion for the fiscal year 2017. The impact of currency translation resulted in
an increase of $275.1 million, or 3.0%, compared to fiscal year 2017.
The decrease in net sales revenue excluding currency impact $57.0 million, or 0.6%, was driven largely by a 2.1% reduction in volume/mix, mainly in the Rigid Packaging reporting
segment, partially offset by favorable pricing of 0.6%, mainly from passing through higher raw material costs in both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging reporting segments and
benefits from acquisitions in the Rigid Packaging reporting segment of 0.6%.
24
Net income attributable to Amcor plc increased by $11.2 million, or 2.0%, to $575.2 million for the fiscal year 2018, from $564.0 million for the fiscal year 2017 as a result
of the factors discussed in the preceding paragraph. Currency impacts on translating operating income were positive.
Diluted EPS increased to $0.49 for fiscal year 2018, from $0.48 for fiscal year 2017, with the net income attributable to ordinary shareholders increasing by 2.0% and the
diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding decreasing 0.2% year-over-year.

Gross profit decreased by $57.7 million, or 3.1%, to $1.8 billion for fiscal year 2019, from $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by
unfavorable foreign exchange of $103 million partially offset by increased volumes, timing of raw material price recovery in the Flexibles reporting segment and reduced operating
costs in the plants, particularly in the Flexibles reporting segment.
Gross profit decreased by $55.0 million, or 2.9%, to $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2018, from $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact
of reduced volumes, particularly in the Rigid Packaging reporting segment, and the timing of higher raw material price recovery in the Flexibles reporting segment and reduced
operating costs.
Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expense
(in millions)  2019  2018  2017
SG&A expenses  $ (999.0) $ (793.2) $ (850.2)
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales  (10.6)% (8.5)% (9.3)%
Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $205.8 million, or 25.9%, to $999.0 million for fiscal year 2019, from $793.2 million for fiscal year 2018. The
increase was largely related to Bemis transaction related costs with some offset from restructuring activity SG&A savings and other group initiatives.
Sales, general and administrative expenses decreased by $57 million, or 6.7%, to $793.2 million for fiscal year 2018, from $850.2 million for fiscal year 2017. The decrease
was evident both in the Rigid Packaging reporting segment and the Flexibles reporting segment and primarily driven by year-over-year restructuring and cost saving initiatives.

Restructuring and related costs increased by $90.6 million to $130.8 million for fiscal year 2019, from $40.2 million for fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily driven
by $64.1 million and $47.9 million of spend related to the 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan and 2019 Bemis Integration Plan, respectively.
Restructuring and related costs decreased by $103.0 million, or 71.9%, to $40.2 million for fiscal year 2018, from $143.2 million for fiscal year 2017. The decrease was
primarily driven by lower spend on the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan in fiscal year 2018 of $14.4 million compared to $135.4 million in fiscal year 2017 as the restructuring
program was winding down.
Consolidated Other Income, Net
(in millions)  2019  2018  2017
Other income, net  $ 186.4 $ 43.2 $ 66.8

Other income, net increased by $143.2 million to $186.4 million for fiscal year 2019, from $43.2 million for fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the gain
of $159.1 million in relation to the sale of three Amcor medical packaging facilities in the United States ("U.S. Remedy") related to the Bemis acquisition.
Other income, net decreased by $23.6 million, or 35.3%, to $43.2 million for fiscal year 2018, from $66.8 million for fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by
the non-recurrence in 2018 of a bargain purchase gain and re-measurement gain on purchase of the remaining 50% of Discma AG in the amount of $22.3 million recognized for
fiscal year 2017.
Consolidated Interest Income

Interest income increased by $3.7 million, or 28.2%, to $16.8 million for fiscal year 2019, from $13.1 million for fiscal year 2018. Increase is primarily attributed to an
increase in variable interest rates in fiscal year 2019.
Interest income remained relatively stable at $13.1 million for fiscal year 2018, compared to $12.2 million for fiscal year 2017.
Consolidated Interest Expense
(in millions)  2019  2018  2017
Interest expense  $ (207.9) $ (210.0) $ (190.9)
Interest expense as a percentage of net sales  (2.2)% (2.3)% (2.1)%
Interest expense remained relatively stable at $207.9 million for fiscal year 2019 compared to $210.0 million for fiscal year 2018.
27
Interest expense increased by $19.1 million, or 10.0%, to $210.0 million for fiscal year 2018, from $190.9 million for fiscal year 2017. The increase was primarily driven by
the increase in the average U.S. dollar LIBOR rate on U.S. floating dollar denominated debt.
Consolidated Other Non-Operating Income (Loss), Net
(in millions)  2019  2018  2017
Other non-operating income (loss), net  $ 3.5 $ (74.1) $ (21.6)
Other non-operating income (loss), net, as a percentage of net sales  0.0% (0.8)% (0.2)%
Other non-operating income, net increased by $77.6 million, or 104.7%, to $3.5 million for fiscal year 2019, from an other non-operating loss, net of $74.1 million for fiscal
year 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the non-recurrence of the unwind of net investment hedge activities not deemed to be effective net investment hedging instruments
under U.S. GAAP.
Other non-operating losses, net increased by $52.5 million, or 243.1%, to $74.1 million for fiscal year 2018, from $21.6 million for fiscal year 2017. The increase was
primarily driven by the foreign exchange rate movements on external loans not deemed to be effective net investment hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP.
Consolidated Income Tax Expense
(in millions)  2019  2018  2017
Income tax expense  $ (171.5) $ (118.8) $ (148.9)
Effective tax rate  28.4% 16.4% 20.8%
Income tax expense increased by $52.7 million, or 44.4%, to $171.5 million for fiscal year 2019, from $118.8 million for fiscal year 2018. Income tax expense for fiscal
year 2019 includes an impact from the anti-trust remedies the company had to take for the regulators to approve the merger with Bemis. The increase in the effective tax rate for
2019 largely reflects the non-deductibility of transaction costs that are capital in nature and the taxation of the U.S. Remedy sale.
Presentation of Non-GAAP Information
This Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") from continuing operations, adjusted net
income and net debt.
This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("U.S. GAAP"). Amcor's management uses the non-GAAP measures to evaluate operating performance and believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable
investors to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings from banks and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity. We
periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions, expected future cash flows, potential funding requirements for debt refinancing, capital
expenditures and acquisitions, the cost of capital, sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios, the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings, and our ease of access to
funding sources. Based on our current cash flow from operating activities and available cash, we believe our cash flows provided by operating activities, together with borrowings
available under our credit facilities, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures and other commitments.

Cash Flow Overview
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
Net cash inflows provided by operating activities decreased by $95.3 million, or 10.9%, to $776.1 million for fiscal year 2019, from $871.4 million for fiscal year 2018.
This decrease was primarily driven by Bemis transaction related costs partially offset by working capital improvements.
Net cash inflows provided by operating activities decreased by $37.5 million, or 4.1%, to $871.4 million for fiscal year 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a cash
outflow in working capital of $122.5 million in 2018 compared to a cash outflow of $51.0 million in fiscal year 2017.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
Net cash inflows provided by investing activities increased by $252.1 million, or 104.2%, to $10.2 million for fiscal year 2019, from net cash outflows used by investing
activities of $241.9 million for fiscal year 2018. This increase was from proceeds from sale of affiliated companies and subsidiaries of $216.3 million, which primarily related to the
cash proceeds of the U.S. Remedy.
Capital expenditures were $332.2 million for fiscal year 2019, a decrease of $32.8 million compared to $365.0 million for fiscal year 2018. The decrease in capital
expenditures was primarily the result of general capital expenditure decreases across both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging Segments.
Net cash outflows used in investing activities decreased by $390.1 million, or 61.7%, to $241.9 million for fiscal year 2018, from $632.0 million for fiscal year 2017. This
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in payments for acquisitions of
30
businesses ($0.0 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to $335.6 million in fiscal year 2017) in addition to higher proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment and other
intangible assets ($137.0 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to $82.9 million in fiscal year 2017).
Capital expenditures were $365.0 million for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $14.3 million compared to $379.3 million for fiscal year 2017. The decrease in capital
expenditures was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount spent on greenfield plants, partially offset by full year impacts of acquisitions in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal
year 2017, when Sonoco was acquired.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities
Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by $222.2 million, or 40.9%, to $764.9 million for fiscal year 2019 , from $542.7 million for fiscal year 2018. This
increase was primarily due the repayment of long-term debt, offset by the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.
Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by $319.7 million, or 143.4%, to $542.7 million for fiscal year 2018, from $223.0 million for fiscal year 2017. This
increase was primarily due to repayments of long-term debt increasing to $4.7 billion in 2018 compared to $3.7 billion in 2017, net proceeds from borrowings increasing to $4.5
billion in 2018 compared to $4.0 billion in 2017 and dividend payments increasing from $489.1 million in 2017 to $526.8 million in 2018, partially offset by the increase in short-
term debt borrowings from $114.0 million in 2017 to $155.4 million in 2018.
Net Debt
We borrow money from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes and commercial paper. We
have a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings.
Short-term debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the short-term nature of the
borrowings, except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months. The current portion of the long-term debt consists of debt
amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date.
Our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness we can incur to a range
between 7.5% to 15.0% of our total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions and variations by facility. In addition, the bank debt facilities and U.S. private placement debt require
us to comply with certain financial covenants, including leverage and interest coverage ratios. The negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the
related debt agreements. As of June 30, 2019, we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities and U.S. private placement debt.
Our net debt as of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 was $5.5 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, with the change being primarily due to the Bemis acquisition.
Available Financing
As of June 30, 2019, we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of $2.7 billion. Our senior facilities are available to fund working capital, growth capital
expenditures and refinancing obligations and are provided to us by five separate bank syndicates. As of June 30, 2019, the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit
of $5.6 billion, of which $2.9 billion had been drawn (inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities). Our
senior facilities mature between fiscal years 2020 and 2024.
Dividend Payments
In fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, we paid $679.7 million, $526.8 million, and $489.1 million, respectively, in dividends.
Credit Rating
31
Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies. These credit ratings
are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, for various tenors and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid, including European and U.S. debt
capital markets and from global financial institutions.
Share Repurchases
We had cash outflows of $20.2 million, $35.7 million, and $40.2 million for the purchase of our shares in the open market during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively, as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of share-based compensation awards. As of June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we held treasury shares at cost of $16.1
million, $10.7 million and $8.1 million, representing 1.4 million, 0.9 million and 0.7 million shares, respectively.
Contractual Obligations
The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, operating lease obligations and certain other commitments as of
June 30, 2019. These amounts do not reflect all planned spending under the various categories but rather that portion of spending to which we are contractually committed.

(1) Long-term debt obligations include liabilities maturing in fiscal year 2020 which have been classified as long-term liabilities in accordance with our ability and intent to refinance such
obligations on a long-term basis.
(2) Variable interest rate commitments are based on the current contractual maturity date of the underlying facility , calculated on the existing drawdown as at June 30, 2019, after allowing for
increases/(decreases) in projected bank reference rates.
(3) We lease motor vehicles, property , plant and equipment under operating leases. The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. Not included in the above commitments
are contingent rental payments which may arise as part of the rental increase indexed to the consumer price index or in the event that units produced by certain leased assets exceed a
predetermined production capacity . 
(4) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Other than as described under "Contractual Obligations" as of June 30, 2019, we had no significant off-balance sheet contractual obligations or other commitments.
Liquidity Risk and Outlook
Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter difficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting our obligations related to financial liabilities. We
manage our liquidity risk centrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committed credit
facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of our business, we aim to maintain flexibility within our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds,
unsecured notes, commercial paper and factoring. The following guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk:
•Maintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least $200 million that can be drawn at short notice;
32
•regularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational, investing and financing activities;
•generally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets;
•maintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency;
•managing credit risk related to financial assets;
•monitoring the duration of long-term debt;
•only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions; and
•to the extent practicable, spreading the maturity dates of long-term debt facilities.
As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, an aggregate principal amount of $221.3 million and $759.5 million, respectively, was drawn under these commercial paper programs.
However, such programs are backstopped by committed bank syndicated loan facilities with maturities in April 2022 ($750.0 million), April 2023 ($1.5 billion) and April 2024 ($1.5
billion), under which we had $2.2 billion in unused capacity remaining as of June 30, 2019.
We expect long-term future funding needs to primarily relate to refinancing and servicing our outstanding financial liabilities maturing as outlined above and to finance our
growth capital expenditure and payments for acquisitions that may be completed. We expect to continue to fund our long-term business needs on the same basis as in the past, i.e.,
partially through the cash flow provided by operating activities available to the business and management of the capital of the business, in particular through issuance of commercial
paper and debt securities on a regular basis. We decide on discretionary growth capital expenditures and acquisitions individually based on, among other factors, the return on
investment after related financing costs and the payback period of required upfront cash investments in light of our mid-term liquidity planning covering a period of four years post
the current financial year. Our long-term access to liquidity depends on both our results of operations and on the availability of funding in domestic and international financial
markets.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and
judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
•The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities;
•The valuation of intangible assets and goodwill;
•The calculation of deferred taxes; and
•The calculation of equity method investments.
Pension Costs
Approximately 50% of our defined benefits plans are closed to new entrants and future accruals. The accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the
overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States,
Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Net periodic pension cost recorded in fiscal year 2019 was $12.5 million, compared to pension cost of $7.7 million in fiscal year
2018 and $80.2 million in fiscal year 2017. We expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for fiscal year 2020 to be approximately $6.3 million. 
For our sponsored plans, the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets,
discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting
estimates related to our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets,
actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the
time of valuation, as well as
33
independent studies of trends performed by our actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.
The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an
asset, in the case of an overfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as
components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires
remeasurement, based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor
and the prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life
expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost
are presented in the consolidated income statements separately from the service cost component and outside operating income.
We review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. The discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a high-
quality corporate bond yield curve, derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable third-party indexes, data providers, and rating agencies. In countries where
there is no deep market in corporate bonds, we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate. For Mexico, Poland and Turkey a corporate bond credit spread has
been added to the government bond yields. Additionally, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future long-
term return assumption for each individual asset class. A single long-term return assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plan's target asset allocation.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and goodwill. Determining the portion of the
purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is
generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and asset group and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is
determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods.
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is
instead tested annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Our reporting units each contain goodwill that is assessed for potential
impairment. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which is defined as an operating segment, at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair value of the reporting
unit. We have five reporting units, of which four are included in our Flexible Packaging Reporting Segment. The other Reporting Segment is Rigid Packaging.
Goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year. We elected to early adopt the Accounting Standards Update 2017-
04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, in fiscal year 2017. As a result of this election, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would recognize
an impairment loss
34
equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill.
Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the
judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including undiscounted projected future cash flows. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more
frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings, adverse equity market conditions, and other external events may require
more frequent assessments.
Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships, technology, trademarks and software and are amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives, which range from one to 20 years. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the
remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows and discount rates.
These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, condition, and amounts of future cash flows.
Deferred Taxes
We deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The determination of uncertain tax positions is based
on an evaluation of whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return will be sustained
on tax audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not
likelihood of being sustained upon settlement. Significant estimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit.
Additionally, we are also required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income which might result in the need for a valuation
allowance of deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards if we do not reach the more likely than not threshold based on all available
evidence. Significant judgments and estimates, including expected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the feasibility of tax planning strategies, are required in
determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. If actual results differ from these estimates or there are future changes to tax laws or statutory
tax rates, we may need to adjust valuation allowances or tax liabilities, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Equity Accounted Investments
Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which we believe we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and
cash dividends paid. The assessment of whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary and the amount of such other-than-temporary decline requires
significant estimates.
We review our investment in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There
was a prolonged and significant decline in AMVIG's quoted share price during the year ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. We determined these prolonged declines were other than
temporary impairments of our investment in AMVIG. Accordingly, we recorded impairments of $14.0 million and $36.5 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Overview
Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks and financial risks. Our overall risk management program seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of these risks on
its financial performance. From time to time, we enter into various derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts, commodity fixed price swaps (on behalf of
customers) and interest rate swaps to manage these risks. Our hedging activities are conducted on a centralized basis through standard
35
operating procedures and delegated authorities, which provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce
the economic risk associated with movements in foreign exchange rates, raw material prices and to fixed and variable interest rates, but may not have been designated or qualify for
hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statement volatility. However, we do not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In
addition, we may enter into loan agreements in currencies other than the respective legal entity's functional currency to economically hedge foreign exchange risk in net investments
in foreign subsidiaries, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statement volatility.
There have been no material changes in the risks described below for the fiscal years 2019 and 2018 related to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, raw material and
commodity price risk and credit risk.
Interest Rate Risk
Our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates and, where appropriate,
hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges so the changes in
the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense.
A hypothetical but reasonably possible increase of 1% in the floating rate on the relevant interest rate yield curve applicable to both, derivative and non-derivative
instruments denominated in U.S. dollars, the currency with the largest interest rate sensitivity, outstanding as of June 30, 2019, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income
before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies of $17.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2019.
Foreign Exchange Risk
We operate in over 40 countries across the world.
For the year ended June 30, 2019, a hypothetical but reasonably possible adverse change of 1% in the underlying average foreign currency exchange rate for the Euro would
have resulted in an adverse impact on our net sales of $22.9 million.
In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, 36% and 33% of our net sales, respectively, were effectively generated in U.S. dollar functional currency entities. For the same years, 24%
and 26% of net sales, respectively, were generated in Euro functional currency entities with the remaining 40% and 41% of net sales, respectively, being generated in entities with
functional currencies other than U.S. dollars and Euros. The impact of translating Euro and other non-U.S. dollar net sales and operating expenses into U.S. dollar for reporting
purposes will vary depending on the movement of those currencies from period to period.
Raw Material and Commodity Price Risk
The primary raw materials for our products are resins, film, aluminum, and liquids. We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and are
exposed to commodity price risk from a number of commodities and certain other raw materials and energy price risk.
Changes in prices of our key raw materials and commodities, including resins, film, aluminum, and liquids and other raw materials, may result in a temporary or permanent
reduction in income before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies depending on the level of recovery by material type. The level of recovery depends both
on the type of material and the market in which we operate. Across our business, we have a number of contract provisions that allow for passing on of raw material price fluctuations
to customers within contractually predefined periods.
A hypothetical but reasonably possible 1% increase on average prices for resins, film, aluminum and liquids, not passed on to the customer by way of a price adjustment,
would have resulted in an increase in cost of sales and hence an adverse impact on income before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies for fiscal years
2019 and 2018 of $41.4 million and $43.7 million, respectively.
Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss. We are exposed to credit risk arising from financing
activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign
36
exchange transactions and other financial instruments, as well as from over-the-counter raw material and commodity related derivative instruments.
We manage our credit risk from balances with financial institutions through standard operating procedures, which provide guidelines on setting limits to minimize the
concentration of risks and therefore mitigating financial loss through potential counterparty failure and on dealing and settlement procedures. The investment of surplus funds is
made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each specific counterparty. Financial derivative instruments can only be entered into with high credit
quality approved financial institutions with a minimum long-term credit rating of A- or better by Standard & Poor's. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, we did not have a significant
concentration of credit risk in relation to derivatives entered into in accordance with our hedging and risk management activities.

Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Amcor plc
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Amcor plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2019, and the related consolidated statement of
income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for the year then ended, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of June 30, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Amcor Plc
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Amcor Plc (formerly known as Amcor Limited) and its subsidiaries (the “Company’) as of June 30, 2018, and the related
consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of equity, and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the
two years in the period ended June 30, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two
years in the period ended June 30, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 - Business Description
Amcor plc ("Amcor" or the "Company") is a holding company incorporated under the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company incorporated under the laws of the
Bailiwick of Jersey in July, 2018, in order to effect the Company's combination with Bemis Company, Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed "Amcor plc"
and became a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey.
The Company develops and produces a broad range of packaging products including flexible packaging, rigid containers, specialty cartons, and closures.
On June 11, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc ("Bemis"). The combination of Amcor and Bemis has created a global packaging leader
that employs approximately 50,000 individuals and has 250 manufacturing facilities in more than 40 countries. See Note 4, "Acquisitions," for more information on the Bemis
acquisition.
The Company's business activities are organized around two reporting segments, Flexible Packaging and Rigid Packaging. The Company has a globally diverse operating
footprint, selling to customers in Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. The Company's sales are widely diversified, with the majority of sales
made to the food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical device, home and personal care, and other consumer goods end markets. All markets are considered to be highly competitive as
to price, innovation, quality and service.
Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").
Business Combinations: The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which requires separate recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from goodwill, at
the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the
acquiree over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the
acquisition date, the Company has the ability to record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of
the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the
consolidated income statement.
Discontinued Operations Presentation: The consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect the three plants in Europe acquired as part of the Bemis acquisition as a
discontinued operation (see Note 5, "Discontinued Operations") as the Company agreed to divest of these plants as a condition of approval from the European Commission.
Estimates and Assumptions Required: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
These estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates on an
ongoing basis and adjusts or revises the estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their impacts cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from
these estimates. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of the periods presented.
Translation of Foreign Currencies: The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries is generally the local currency
of such entity. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are remeasured at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date to the entity’s functional currency.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to short-term and long-term debt are recorded in other non-operating income (loss), net in the consolidated income statements.
The Company recorded such
45
foreign currency transaction net gains (losses) of $1.1 million, $(82.7) million and $40.7 million during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. All other foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income, net in the consolidated income statements. These foreign currency transaction net gains (losses) amounted to $8.9
million, $1.0 million and $1.0 million during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the reporting currency of the Company are translated using average
exchange rates in effect during each year. Assets and liabilities of operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance
sheet date, while equity balances are translated at historical rates. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of
shareholders’ equity.
Revenue Recognition: The Company generates revenue by providing its customers with flexible and rigid packaging serving a variety of markets including food, consumer products
and healthcare end markets. The Company enters into a variety of agreements with customers, including quality agreements, pricing agreements and master supply agreements which
outline the terms under which the Company does business with a specific customer. The Company also sells to some customers solely based on purchase orders. The Company has
concluded for the vast majority of its revenues, that its contracts with customers are either a purchase order or the combination of a purchase order with a master supply agreement.
All revenue recognized in the income statement is considered to be revenue from contracts with customers.
The Company typically satisfies the obligation to provide packaging to customers at a point in time upon shipment when control is transferred to customers. Revenue is
recognized net of allowances for returns and customer claims and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The Company
does not have any material contract assets or contract liabilities. The Company disaggregates revenue based on geography. Disaggregation of revenue is presented in Note 20,
"Segments".
Significant Judgments
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant
judgment. The Company identified potential performance obligations in its customer master supply agreements and determined that none of them are capable of being distinct as the
customer can only benefit from the supplied packaging. Therefore, the Company has concluded that it has one performance obligation to supply packaging to customers.
The Company may provide variable consideration in several forms which are determined through its agreements with customers. The Company can offer prompt payment
discounts, sales rebates or other incentive payments to customers. Sales rebates and other incentive payments are typically awarded upon achievement of certain performance
metrics, including volume. The Company accounts for variable consideration using the most likely amount method. The Company utilizes forecasted sales data and rebate
percentages specific to each customer agreement and updates its judgment of the amounts to which the customer is entitled each period.
The Company enters into long term agreements with certain customers, under which it is obligated to make various up-front payments for which it expects to receive a
benefit in excess of the cost over the term of the contract. These up-front payments are deferred and reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets
on its consolidated balance sheet. Contract incentives are typically recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement.
Practical Expedients
The Company sells primarily through its direct sales force. Any external sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would be one year
or less. External sales commission expense is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income.
The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs. Accordingly, shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of products
sold while amounts billed to customers are classified as a component of net sales.
The Company excluded from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific
revenue producing transaction and collected from the customer, including sales taxes, value added taxes, excise taxes and use taxes. Accordingly, the tax amounts are not included in
net sales.
46
The Company will not adjust the promised consideration for the time value of money for contracts where the difference between the time of payment and performance is
one year or less.
Research and Development: Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.
Restructuring Costs: Restructuring costs are recognized when the liability is incurred. The Company calculates severance obligations based on its standard customary practices.
Accordingly, the Company records provisions for severance when probable and estimable and the Company has committed to the restructuring plan. In the absence of a standard
customary practice or established local practice, liabilities for severance are recognized when incurred. If fixed assets are to be disposed of as a result of the Company’s restructuring
efforts, the assets are written off when the Company commits to dispose of them and they are no longer in use. Depreciation is accelerated on fixed assets for the period of time the
asset continues to be used until the asset ceases to be used. Other restructuring costs, including costs to relocate equipment, are generally recorded as the cost is incurred or the
service is provided.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid temporary investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents include certificates of deposit that can be readily liquidated without penalty at the Company’s option. Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair market
value.
Trade Receivables, Net: Trade accounts receivable, net, are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect, which is net of an allowance for sales returns and the estimated
losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. When determining the collectability of specific customer accounts, a number of factors are evaluated,
including: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer and changes in customer payment terms or practices. In addition, overall historical collection
experience, current economic industry trends and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable are considered when determining the required allowance for doubtful
accounts. The Company has an allowance for doubtful accounts of $34.4 million and $16.9 million recorded at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in trade receivables, net, on the
consolidated balance sheet. The current year expense to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statement of income.
The Company enters into factoring arrangements from time to time to sell trade receivables to third-party financial institutions. Sales of receivables are accounted for in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing ("ASC 860"). Agreements which
result in true sales of the transferred receivables, as defined in ASC 860, which occur when receivables are transferred without recourse to the Company, are reflected as a reduction
of trade receivables, net on the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Agreements that allow the Company to maintain effective control over the transferred receivables and which do not qualify as a true sale, as defined in ASC 860, are accounted for
as secured borrowings and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within trade receivables, net and short-term debt. The expenses associated with receivables factoring are
recorded in the consolidated income statements within interest expense. As of June 30, 2019, $24.7 million of trade receivables were factored qualifying as a true sale and the
associated discount on sale was not significant. Factored receivables not qualifying as a true sale were accounted for as secured borrowings. As of June 30, 2018, none of the
factoring arrangements the Company entered into qualified as true sales and thus were accounted for as secured borrowings. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, amounts factored
recorded under trade receivables, net and short-term debt, were $152.7 million and $335.6 million, respectively.
Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, as determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value. Inventory values using the FIFO method of
accounting approximate replacement cost. Inventories are summarized at June 30, as follows:
(in millions)  2019  2018
Raw materials and supplies  $ 864.6 $ 640.8
Work in process  348.9 200.9
Finished goods  832.0 573.0
Less: inventory reserves  (91.7) (55.9)
Total inventories (1)  $ 1,953.8 $ 1,358.8
(1) Increase primarily attributable to the acquisition of Bemis Company . Refer to Note 4, "Acquisitions," for more information about the Company's acquisition of Bemis.
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net: Property, plant and equipment ("PP&E"), net is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and includes expenditures for
new facilities and equipment and those costs which substantially
47
increase the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Cost of constructed assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the construction period. Maintenance and repairs that
do not improve efficiency or extend economic life are expensed as incurred.
PP&E is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets or, in the case of leasehold improvements and leased assets, over the period of
the lease or useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter, as described below. The Company periodically reviews these estimated useful lives and, when appropriate, changes are made
prospectively.
Leasehold land  Over lease term
Land improvements  Shorter of lease term or 20 - 33 years
Buildings  14 - 40 years
Plant and equipment  3 - 25 years
Capital leases  Shorter of lease term or 5 - 25 years
For tax purposes, the Company generally uses accelerated methods of depreciation. The tax effect of the difference between book and tax depreciation has been provided for
as deferred income taxes.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets: The Company reviews long-lived assets, primarily PP&E and certain identifiable intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment when facts or
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows
are less than the carrying value of the assets, the carrying values are reduced to the estimated fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash
flows or external appraisals, as applicable.
Impairment losses recognized in the consolidated income statement were as follows:
  Years ended June 30,
(in millions)  2019  2018  2017
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)  $ 47.7 $ 0.4 $ —
Restructuring related costs  27.4 4.0 22.4
Total impairment losses recognized in the consolidated income statements  $ 75.1 $ 4.4 $ 22.4
Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested annually or
whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. Among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are a reporting unit’s
operating results significantly declining relative to its operating plan or historical performance, and competitive pressures and changes in the general markets in which it operates.
All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which is defined as the operating segment, or one level below the operating segment. The Company has 5 reporting units with
goodwill that are assessed for potential impairment.
In performing the required impairment tests, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment
for goodwill impairment. If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative
assessment is performed. A quantitative assessment primarily consists of a present value (discounted cash flow) method to determine the fair value of the reporting units with
goodwill. The Company performs its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year.
A qualitative impairment analysis was performed on all reporting units for the fiscal year ended 2019, while a quantitative analysis was performed for fiscal years ended
2018 and 2017. The analysis concluded that goodwill was not impaired.
Other Intangible Assets, Net: Contractual or separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized against income using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives, with original periods ranging from one to 20 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the costs of the intangible
assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company tests finite-lived intangible assets for
impairment when facts and circumstances indicate carrying value may not be recoverable from their
48
undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values.
Costs incurred to develop software programs to be used solely to meet the Company's internal needs have been capitalized as computer software within other intangible
assets.
Financial Instruments: The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The impact on earnings from recognizing the fair values of these
instruments depends on their intended use, their hedge designation and their effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair values of the exposures they are hedging. Derivatives not
designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through income. Depending on the nature of derivatives designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value are
either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in shareholders’ equity through other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized. Gains or losses, if any, related to the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized through earnings in the current
period.
Note 11, "Derivative Instruments," contains expanded details relating to specific derivative instruments included on the Company’s balance sheet, such as forward foreign
currency exchange contracts, currency swap contracts, and interest rate swap arrangements.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans to which it makes contributions on behalf of employees. The expense under such plans was
$39.9 million, $39.8 million and $39.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Company sponsors a number of defined benefit plans that provide benefits to current and former employees. For the company-sponsored plans, the relevant accounting
guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to determine the present value of future
obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to its pension plans are critical
accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and
contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation, as well as independent
studies of trends performed by the Company’s actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.
The Company recognizes the funded status of each defined benefit pension plan in the consolidated balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each
underfunded plan is recognized as a liability. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on updated assumptions and
information about the individuals covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a
straight-line basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive
participants. The service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated income
statements separately from the service cost component and outside operating income.
Equity Method Investments: Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which the Company believes it exercises significant influence over operating and financial policies,
are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize the investor’s share of earnings or losses of
the investee after the date of acquisition and is adjusted for impairment whenever it is determined that a decline in the fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary. See
Note 7 , "Equity Method Investments," for more information regarding the Company's equity method investments.
Share-Based Compensation: Amcor has a variety of equity incentive plans. For employee awards with a service or market condition, compensation expense is recognized over the
vesting period on a straight-line basis using the grant date fair value of the award and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. For awards with a performance
condition, the Company must reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust compensation cost based on its probability assessment. The Company also has
cash-settled share-based compensation plans which are accounted for as liabilities. Such share-based awards are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. The Company
estimates forfeitures based on employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest and historical forfeiture experience.
Income Taxes: The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at
49
each balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported in the financial statements. The
provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense included in the consolidated
financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities.
Deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more
likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax
positions for proposed adjustments from various tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must
often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax
provision. See Note 16, "Income Taxes," for more information.
Note 3 - New Accounting Guidance
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance that provides clarity and reduces diversity in practice, cost and complexity when applying existing accounting guidance for
modifications to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The amendments specify that all changes to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment award will
require an entity to apply modification accounting, unless all of the following are met: (1) the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award
immediately before the original award is modified, (2) the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before
the original award is modified and (3) the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award
immediately before the original award is modified. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning
after December 15, 2017, for all entities. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not been issued. The new
guidance is to be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date. This guidance was effective for the Company on July 1, 2018 and did not have a material
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the definition of a business by adding a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether transactions should be
accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. In order to be considered a business under the new guidance, the assets in the transaction need to include an input and a
substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Public business entities should apply the amendments in this update to annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The
guidance was effective for the Company on July 1, 2018. The Company followed the new guidance with respect to its acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc. and will apply the
guidance to all future business combinations.
In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance which supersedes current revenue recognition requirements. This guidance is based on the principle that revenue is recognized
to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company adopted the new revenue guidance on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective application transition method. The Company elected the practical expedient to
apply the new revenue standard to only contracts that were not completed as of July 1, 2018. Adoption did not have an impact on the Company's financial statements, but did
significantly impact the Company's disclosures for revenue. Refer to Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," for updated revenue disclosures which are required by the new
guidance.
50
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that requires the Company to disclose a description of the Company’s accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from
accumulated other comprehensive income and whether the Company elects to reclassify the stranded income tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (‘‘The Act’’), along with
information about other income tax effects that are reclassified. For all entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. Entities can choose whether to apply the amendments
retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the Act is recognized or to apply the amendments in the period of adoption. This guidance will be effective for the Company on
July 1, 2019. The Company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies existing guidance in order to allow companies to more accurately present the economic effects of risk
management activities in the financial statements. For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2017-12 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. This guidance will be effective
for the Company on July 1, 2019 using the modified respective approach, with the exception of presentation and disclosure guidance which will be adopted prospectively. The
Company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires financial assets or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount
expected to be collected when finalized. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that will be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the
net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This guidance affects loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-
sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. For public business entities,
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance will be effective for
the Company on July 1, 2020 and will be adopted using the modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this new guidance
will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that required lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner
similar to today’s accounting. The guidance also eliminates today’s real estate-specific provisions and changes the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs and
lease executory costs for all entities. Lease classification will determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense. The Company will elect the optional transition method
that allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption and will not restate prior periods. The Company has formed a cross-functional project team to implement the
new guidance. The project team is working to implement a lease accounting software solution and resolve the vendor's identified software issues. The Company will adopt the
guidance on July 1, 2019. Based on our current lease portfolio, adoption of the standard will result in an increase in operating lease assets and liabilities in a range of $600 million to
$800 million with an immaterial impact on our Consolidated Statement of Income; however, this estimate is subject to change as we finalize our implementation. In addition, we
expect to de-recognize existing deferred gains on sale leasebacks of approximately $75.0 million as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of July 1, 2019.
Note 4 - Acquisitions
Year ended June 30, 2019
Bemis Company, Inc.
On June 11, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Bemis Company, Inc ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible
packaging products based in the United States. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, dated as of August 6, 2018, each outstanding share of Bemis common stock that was issued
and outstanding upon completion of the transaction was converted into the right to receive 5.1 ordinary shares of the Company traded on the NYSE.
51
The following table summarizes the fair value of consideration exchanged:
Bemis shares outstanding at June 11, 2019 (in millions)  91.7
Share Exchange Ratio  5.1
Price per Share (Based on Amcor’s closing share price on June 11, 2019)  11.18
Total Equity Consideration  5,229.6
The acquisition of Bemis positions the Company as a global leader in consumer packaging with a comprehensive global footprint in flexible packaging and greater scale in
key regions of North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, along with industry-leading research and development capabilities. The Bemis acquisition contributed
$215.4 million in net sales and a $12.4 million net loss, which includes transaction related costs, to the Company's consolidated fiscal year 2019 results.
    
The acquisition of Bemis was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations," which required allocation of the purchase
price to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The following is a summary of the preliminary allocation of the purchase price:
(in millions)   
Cash and cash equivalents  $ 3.3
Trade receivables  436.4
Inventories  665.1
Prepaid expenses and other current assets  83.8
Assets held for sale  415.6
Property, plant and equipment  1,390.7
Deferred tax assets  35.5
Other intangible assets  2,030.2
Other non-current assets  34.5
Total identifiable assets acquired  5,095.1
   
Current portion of long-term debt  1.7
Short-term debt  8.6
Trade payables  287.7
Accrued employee costs  158.0
Other current liabilities  275.9
Liabilities held for sale  21.9
Long-term debt, less current portion  1,365.3
Deferred tax liabilities  782.6
Employee benefit obligation  62.6
Other non-current liabilities  38.9
Total liabilities assumed  3,003.2
Net identifiable assets acquired  2,091.9
Goodwill  3,137.7
Net assets acquired  $ 5,229.6
    
52
The following table details the preliminary identifiable intangible assets acquired from Bemis, their fair values and estimated useful lives:
  Fair Value  Weighted-average
Estimated Useful Life
  (in millions)  (Years)
Customer relationships  $ 1,730.0 15
Technology  131.0 7
Other  169.2 8
Total other intangible assets  $ 2,030.2  
The initial purchase price allocation is preliminary in nature and subject to adjustments, which could be material. Any necessary adjustments will be finalized within one
year from the date of acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price resulted in $3,137.7 million of goodwill for the Flexibles Segment, which is not tax deductible.
The goodwill on acquisition represents the future economic benefit expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including
assembled workforce and non-contractual relationships, as well as expected future synergies. As the Company finalizes the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it
will determine to which reporting units within the Company's segments any changes in goodwill should be recorded.
The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3
measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows,
appraisals and market
comparables.
Closing of the Bemis acquisition was conditional upon the receipt of regulatory approvals, approval by both Amcor and Bemis shareholders, and satisfaction of other
customary conditions. In order to satisfy certain regulatory approvals, the Company was required to divest three of Bemis' medical packaging facilities located in the United
Kingdom and Ireland ("EC Remedy") and three Amcor medical packaging facilities in the United States ("U.S. Remedy"). The U.S. Remedy was completed during the fourth quarter
of 2019 and the Company received $214.2 million resulting in a gain of $159.1 million which is included in other income, net in the consolidated statement of income. See Note 5,
"Discontinued Operations," for more information on the EC Remedy.
The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared as if the acquisition of Bemis and the sale of the EC Remedy and U.S. Remedy had occurred as of July 1,
2017. The unaudited pro forma information combines the historical results of Amcor and Bemis. 
  Years ended June 30,
(in millions)  2019  2018
Net sales  $ 12,972.4 $ 13,146.3
Income from continuing operations  $ 565.5 $ 535.0
Pro forma adjustments to net sales are as follows:
•Excludes net sales of the EC Remedy and U.S. Remedy.
Pro forma adjustments to income from continuing operations attributable to Amcor plc are as follows:
•Excludes income from the EC Remedy which has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and the U.S. Remedy which has been reported in U.S. GAAP income from
continuing operations;
•excludes acquisition related charges;
•includes preliminary acquisition accounting adjustments, including amortization and depreciation adjustments as a result of the fair value adjustment to property, plant and
equipment; and
•excludes the impact on net income attributable to purchase accounting related inventory effects and sales backlog amortization given these charges do not have a continuing
impact on the consolidated results.
53
The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have occurred had the acquisition been in effect for the periods presented, nor is it
intended to be a projection of future results. For example, the pro forma results do not include the expected synergies from the transactions, nor the related costs to achieve.
Year ended June 30, 2017
Sonoco's Blow Molding Operations
On November 8, 2016, the Company acquired the North American blow molding operations of Sonoco Products Company ("Sonoco"), a global packaging company based
in the United States, for the purchase price of $271.7 million in cash.
The Company acquired six production sites in the United States and one in Canada and customer relationships. The acquisition allowed the Company to expand its
operations in the personal care and specialty food market.
The acquisition of Sonoco's blow molding operations was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, which required
allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The following is a summary of the final allocation of the
purchase price:
(in millions)   
Trade receivables  $ 35.8
Inventories  13.5
Property, plant and equipment  45.7
Deferred tax assets  1.9
Other intangible assets  11.5
Total identifiable assets acquired  108.4
   
Trade payables  19.4
Other current liabilities  4.4
Deferred tax liabilities  1.9
Other non-current liabilties  4.0
Total liabilities assumed  29.7
Net identifiable assets acquired  78.7
Goodwill  193.0
Net assets acquired  $ 271.7
The following table details the identifiable intangible assets acquired from Sonoco, their fair values and estimated useful lives:
  Fair Value  Weighted-average
Estimated Useful Life
  (in millions)  (Years)
Customer relationships  $ 11.5 12
Total other intangible assets  $ 11.5  
The allocation of the purchase price resulted in $193.0 million of goodwill for the Rigid Packaging segment, which is not tax deductible. The goodwill on acquisition is
primarily attributable to expected synergies available to the consolidated entity upon the integration of the businesses into the Company, as well as benefits derived from the acquired
workforce and other intangible assets that cannot be separately recognized.
The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3
measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows,
appraisals and market comparables.
54
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated income statements.
Discma
On June 16, 2017, the Company acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in Discma AG ("Discma") for a total consideration of $25.1 million, with $10.3 million
payable upon close and $14.8 million deferred and contingent on future cash flows. Prior to this acquisition, the fair value of the Company's equity interest in Discma was $22.0
million, resulting in a remeasurement gain of $18.6 million, which was recorded in other income, net in the consolidated income statement for the year ended June 30, 2017. The fair
value of the equity interest in Discma was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.
Note 5 - Discontinued Operations
On February 11, 2019, the Company received approval from the European Commission ("EC") for the acquisition of Bemis. A condition of the approval was an agreement
to divest three Bemis medical packaging facilities located in the United Kingdom and Ireland ("EC Remedy"). Upon completion of the Bemis acquisition on June 11, 2019, the
Company determined that the EC Remedy met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation, in accordance with ASC 205-20, "Discontinued Operations."
The sale of the EC Remedy occurred on August 8, 2019. Refer to Note 23, "Subsequent Events," for more information about the EC Remedy that occurred after June 30,
2019. The assets and liabilities of the EC Remedy, which is within the Company's Flexibles Segment, are reflected as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2019.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are required to be recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
The following table summarizes the results of the EC Remedy, classified as discontinued operations, from the date of the Bemis acquisition:
  Year ended June 30,
(in millions)  2019
Net sales  $ 9.6
   
Income (loss) from discontinued operations  0.9
Tax expense on discontinued operations  (0.2)
Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax  $ 0.7
Note 6 - Restructuring Plans
2019 Bemis Integration Plan
In connection with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined
organization. As previously announced, the Company continues to target realizing approximately $180 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain, and general
and administrative savings by the end of fiscal year 2022. The total Plan pre-tax cost is estimated at $200 million, with cash payments estimated at $150 million. The 2019 Bemis
Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporate and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2022.
    
In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company incurred $47.9 million of pre-tax restructuring expenses in the Flexibles segment related to this Plan, primarily related to
employee termination costs. There were no cash payments associated with the plan in fiscal year 2019.
2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan
On August 21, 2018, the Company announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging ("2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan") aimed at reducing structural
costs and optimizing the footprint. The Plan includes the closures of
55
manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost reductions.
The Company's total pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $95.0 million with the main component being cost to exit manufacturing facilities and
employee related costs. The Company estimates that approximately $65.0 million of the $95.0 million total costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019
were $30.3 million. The Plan is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2020.
2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan
On June 9, 2016, the Company announced a major initiative ("2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the Flexibles
segment. This initiative was designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with
demand, increase utilization and improve the cost base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed
to market.
As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, the Company has closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. The Company's total
pre-tax restructuring costs were approximately $230.8 million, with approximately $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and
$32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to dismantle equipment and terminate existing lease contracts. The Company estimates that approximately $166.2
million of the $230.8 million total costs has resulted in cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4 million. The Plan was substantially completed by the end
of fiscal year 2019.
Other Restructuring Plans
The Company entered into other individually immaterial restructuring plans ("Other Restructuring Plans"). The Company's restructuring charge related to these Plans was
approximately $18.8 million, $25.8 million and $7.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Consolidated Amcor Restructuring Plans
The total costs incurred from the beginning of the Company's restructuring plans are as follows:

Note 7 - Equity Method Investments
    
Investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, with usually not more
than 50% voting interest, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in investments in affiliated companies. Investments in affiliated companies as of June 30, 2019 and
2018 include an interest in AMVIG Holdings Limited ("AMVIG") of 47.6% and other individually immaterial investments.
AMVIG is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Its quoted share price as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $0.24 (HKD 1.85) and $0.26 (HKD 2.07), respectively. The
value of Amcor's investment in AMVIG based on its quoted share price as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $104.8 million and $116.3 million, respectively.
During the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 the Company received dividends of $8.2 million (HKD 63.7 million), $8.4 million (HKD 65.9 million) and $6.5
million (HKD 50.4 million), respectively, from AMVIG.
The Company reviews its investment in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. Due to impairment indicators present in each of the years presented, the Company performed an impairment test by comparing the carrying value of its investment in
AMVIG to its fair value, which was determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price. The fair value of the investment dropped below its carrying value during fiscal years 2018
and 2019, and therefore the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $14.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, to bring the value of its investment to fair
value.

Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements
The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities listed below reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the
liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
The Company's non-derivative financial instruments primarily include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, short-term debt and long-term debt. At
June 30, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of these
instruments.
Fair value disclosures are classified based on the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 fair value measurements represent exchange-traded securities which are valued at quoted
prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date. Level 2 fair value measurements are
determined using input prices that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. Level 3 fair value
measurements are determined using unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or
liability.
The fair value of long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates its carrying value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt with fixed interest rates is based
on market prices, if available, or expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for financial liabilities with similar risk profiles. The carrying values and estimated
fair values of long-term debt with fixed interest rates (excluding capital leases) were as follows:
  June 30, 2019  June 30, 2018
  
Carrying Value Fair Value  
Carrying Value Fair Value

Total long-term debt with fixed interest rates (excluding commercial paper and
capital leases)  $ 2,955.6 $ 3,041.3 $ 2,781.9 $ 2,841.5
Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Additionally, the Company measures and records certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments and contingent purchase consideration liabilities, at fair
value. The following table summarizes the fair value of these instruments, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy:
  June 30, 2019

Forward exchange contracts  —  6.6 — 6.6
Interest rate swaps  —  1.3 — 1.3
Total liabilities measured at fair value  $ — $ 8.4 $ 14.6 $ 23.0
The fair value of the commodity contracts was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and observed market forward prices
discounted at a currency-specific rate. Forward exchange contract fair values were determined based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets using inputs
such as currency rates and forward points. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market-based swap yield curves,
taking into account current interest rates.
The fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities was determined for each arrangement individually. The fair value was determined using the income
approach with significant inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include the discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement and probability
adjusted financial projections. The expected outcomes are recorded at net present value, which requires adjustment over the life for changes in risks and probabilities.
The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the value of the Company's Level 3 financial liabilities:
  June 30,
(in millions)  2019  2018  2017
Fair value at the beginning of the year  $ 14.6 $ 27.6 $ 36.1
Additions due to acquisitions  —  — 12.6
Changes in fair value of Level 3 liabilities  —  0.8 (2.4)
Payments  (1.0) (13.0) (18.6)
Foreign currency translation  —  (0.8) (0.1)
Fair value at the end of the year  $ 13.6 $ 14.6 $ 27.6
The fair value of contingent purchase consideration liabilities is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The
change in fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities, which was included in other income, net is due to the passage of time and changes in the probability of
achievement used to develop the estimate.

Note 11 - Derivative Instruments
Amcor periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks. The Company does not hold or issue
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting criteria, the Company, at inception, formally designates and documents the
instrument as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge of a specific underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses and documents that its hedges have been and are
expected to continue to be highly effective.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company's policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates and, where
appropriate, hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair
value hedges so the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense.
As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the total notional amount of the Company's receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps was $841.1 million and $586.7 million,
respectively.
Foreign Currency Risk
Amcor manufactures and sells its products and finances operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign
currency exchange rates. The purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging program is to manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.
To manage this exchange rate risk, the Company utilizes forward contracts. Contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges of certain
forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) ("AOCI") and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect
earnings. The ineffective portion is immediately recognized in the consolidated income statements. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts that have not been designated as
hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying consolidated income statements.
As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the notional amount of the outstanding forward contracts was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
The Company also manages its currency exposure related to the net assets of its foreign operations primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant currency.
Foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement of external borrowings designated as net investment hedges of a foreign operation are recognized in AOCI, to the extent
that the hedge is effective. The ineffective portion is immediately recognized in other non-operating income (loss), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated income statements.
When a hedged net investment is disposed of, a percentage of the cumulative amount recognized in AOCI in relation to the hedged net investment is recognized in the consolidated
income statements as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
 
At the beginning of fiscal year 2019, the Company designated non-derivative instruments with a carrying value of $1.4 billion as foreign currency net investment hedges.
During the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Company de-designated €850.0 million of its Euro-denominated notes, which were previously designated as a net investment
hedge in its European subsidiaries. The portion of the net investment hedge recorded through the point of de-designation is included in AOCI and will be reclassified into earnings
only upon the sale or liquidation of the related subsidiaries. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Company settled loans that were denominated in
NZD and HKD, of which NZD 95.0 million and HKD 174.6 million, respectively, were previously designated as net investment hedges. The net investment hedges recorded through
the point of settlement are included in AOCI and will be reclassified into earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the related subsidiaries. As of Jun 30, 2019 the carrying value
of US commercial paper issued which is designated as a net investment hedge was $67.0 million. The Company did not have any net investment hedges in place as of June 30, 2018
and 2017.
62
Commodity Risk
Certain raw materials used in Amcor's production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other
unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility in earnings due to price fluctuations, the Company utilizes fixed price swaps.
Changes in the fair value of commodity hedges are recognized in AOCI. The cumulative amount of the hedge is recognized in the consolidated income statements when the
forecast transaction is realized.
At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had the following outstanding commodity contracts that were entered into to hedge forecasted purchases:
  June 30, 2019  June 30, 2018
Commodity  Volume  Volume

In addition to the fair value associated with derivative instruments noted in the table above, the Company had a carrying value of $67.0 million and nil associated with non-
derivative instruments designated as foreign currency net investment hedges as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The designated foreign currency-denominated debt is
included in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet.
Certain derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are eligible for offset. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to
offset the fair values of these instruments within the consolidated balance sheets.

Where funded, the Company and, in some countries, the employees make cash contributions into the pension fund. In the case of unfunded plans, the Company is
responsible for benefit payments as they fall due. Plan funding requirements are generally determined by local regulation and/or best practice and differ between countries. The local
statutory funding positions are not necessarily consistent with the funded status disclosed on the consolidated balance sheets. For any funded plans in deficit (as measured under local
country guidelines), the Company agrees with the trustees and plan fiduciaries to undertake suitable funding programs to provide additional contributions over time in accordance
with local country requirements. Contributions to the Company's defined benefit pension plans, not including unfunded plans, are expected to be $24.7 million over the next fiscal
year.
The following benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years and thereafter, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

The ERISA Benefit Plan Committee in the United States, the Pension Plan Committee in Switzerland and the Trustees of the pension plans in Canada, Ireland and UK
establish investment policies and strategies for the Company's pension plan assets and are required to consult with the Company on changes to their investment policy. In developing
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date, the Company considers the plan assets' historical returns, asset allocations, and the anticipated future
economic environment and long-term performance of the asset classes. While appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance, the assumption
represents management's best estimate of the long-term prospective return.

Level 1: Mutual funds.  A daily asset value is available for these assets.
Level 2: Assets held in diversified growth funds, pooled funds, financing funds and derivatives, where the value of the assets are determined by the investment managers or
an external valuer based on the probable value of the underlying assets.
Level 3: Indemnified plan assets and a buy-in policy, insurance contacts and pooled funds (equity, credit, macro-orientated, multi-strategy, cash and other). The value of
indemnified plan assets and the buy-in policy are determined based on the value of the liabilities that the assets cover. The value of insurance contracts is determined by the
insurer based on the value of the insurance policies. The value of the pooled funds is calculated by the investment managers based on the values of the underlying
portfolios.

Forward contracts to purchase own shares
The Company's employee share plans require the delivery of shares to employees in the future when rights vest or options are exercised. The Company currently acquires
shares on the open market to deliver shares to employees to satisfy vesting or exercising commitments. This exposes the Company to market price risk.
To manage the market price risk, the Company has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares.
As of June 30, 2019, the Company has entered into forward contracts that mature in June 2020 to purchase 1.0 million shares at a price of $11.00. As of June 30, 2018, the
Company had entered into forward contracts that matured in May 2019 and resulted in the purchase of 2.5 million shares at a price of AUD 13.80.
The forward contracts to purchase the Company's own shares are classified as a liability. Equity is reduced by an amount equal to the fair value of the shares at inception.
The carrying value of the forward contracts at each reporting period was determined based on the present value of the cost required to settle the contract.

Note 16 - Income Taxes
Amcor plc is a tax resident of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The ultimate parent of the Company at June 30, 2018 and 2017 was Amcor
Limited, which was a tax resident in Australia.
The components of income before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies were as follows:
  Years ended June 30,
(in millions)  2019  2018  2017
Domestic  31.7 $ (206.6) $ (26.0)
Foreign  572.4 929.5 741.8
Total income before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies  $ 604.1 $ 722.9 $ 715.8
Income tax expense consisted of the following:

The following is a reconciliation of income tax computed at the UK statutory tax rate of 19% for fiscal year 2019 and 30% for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, to income tax
expense.
  Years ended June 30,

Income tax expense  $ 171.5 $ 118.8 $ 148.9
For fiscal year 2019, the Company's effective tax rate for the year was higher than its UK statutory tax rate primarily due to pretax income being earned in jurisdictions
outside of the UK where the applicable tax rates are higher than the UK statutory tax rate. Amcor operates in over forty different jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates.
The tax expense from operating in non-UK jurisdictions in excess of the UK statutory tax rate is included in the line "Foreign tax rate differential" in the above tax rate reconciliation
table. For fiscal year 2019, the Company's effective tax rate was 28.4% as compared to the prior year effective tax rates of 16.4% and 20.8% for fiscal years 2018 and 2017,
respectively. For changes in the tax law, refer to the below section titled "The Act."

The Company maintains a valuation allowance on net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in jurisdictions for which it does not believe it is more-likely-than-not to
realize those deferred tax assets based upon all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance, carryback periods, reversal of taxable temporary
differences, tax planning strategies and earnings expectations. The Company's valuation allowance increased by $20.4 million, increased by $5.3 million and decreased by $12.0
million for fiscal year 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of the Company’s valuation allowance for the year ended June 30, 2019 is attributed mainly to the valuation
allowance taken over from Bemis of $33.7 million partially offset by net release of valuation allowance of $5.9 million and foreign exchange rate revaluation of $7.4 million.
As of June 30, 2019, the Company has UK net operating losses (tax effected) and tax credits of approximately $4.3 million that do not expire. The Company has non-UK
net operating losses (tax effected) and other tax attribute carryforwards of $320.6 million, the majority of which do not expire. The Company recorded valuation allowances against
deferred tax assets associated with these net operating losses and tax credits. The benefits of these carryforwards are dependent upon the generation of taxable income in the
jurisdictions where they arose.
Amcor considers the following factors, among others, in evaluating its plans for indefinite reinvestment of its subsidiaries' earnings: (i) the forecasts, budgets and financial
requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries, both for the long term and for the short term; and (ii) the tax consequences of any decision to reinvest earnings of any subsidiary.
The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $628.0 million of earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in its
international operations. Upon distribution of such earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to incremental foreign tax. It is not practicable to
estimate the amount of foreign tax that might be payable. A cumulative deferred tax liability of $106.2 million has been recorded attributable to undistributed earnings that the
Company has deemed are no longer indefinitely reinvested. This also includes the tax liability that the Company estimates will be due upon the divestitures required by the national
regulators to approve the merger with
79
Bemis. The remaining undistributed earnings of the Company's subsidiaries are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested and can be repatriated at no tax cost. Accordingly, there is
no provision for income or withholding taxes on these earnings.
The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes." At June 30, 2019 and 2018, unrecognized tax benefits totaled $102.6
million and $74.5 million, respectively, all of which would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017,
the Company accrued $13.8 million, $2.9 million, and $4.6 million of interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions, respectively. The Company does not currently
anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will result in material changes to its financial position within the next 12 months. A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years presented is as follows:
  June 30,
(in millions)  2019  2018  2017
Balance at the beginning of the year  $ 74.5 $ 65.1 $ 56.5
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year  12.5 6.6 1.4
Additions for tax positions of prior years  8.2 8.9 8.8
Reductions for tax positions from prior years  (3.7) (5.3) —
Reductions for settlements  (5.8) —  —
Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations  (12.8) (0.8) (1.6)
Additions related to acquisitions  29.7 —  —
Balance at the end of the year  $ 102.6 $ 74.5 $ 65.1
The Company conducts business in a number of tax jurisdictions and, as such, is required to file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions globally. The years 2015
through 2017 remain open for examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), the year 2018 remains open for examination by Her Majesty’s Revenue &
Customs ("HMRC") and the years 2011-2018 are currently subject to audit or remain open for examination in various US states and non-US tax jurisdictions.
The Company believes that its income tax reserves are adequately maintained taking into consideration both the technical merits of its tax return positions and ongoing
developments in its income tax audits. However, the final determination of the Company's tax return positions, if audited, is uncertain and therefore there is a possibility that final
resolution of these matters could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.
U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("The Act")
On December 22, 2017, The Act was signed into law. This legislation includes significant changes in U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rates and the
creation of a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S.-held foreign subsidiaries. The legislation reduced the U.S.
corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result of the enacted law, the Company was required to revalue deferred tax assets and
liabilities existing as of December 31, 2017 from the 35% federal rate in effect through the end of 2017, to the new 21% rate.

Note 17 - Share-based Compensation
The Company's equity incentive plans include grants of share options, restricted shares/ units, performance shares, performance rights and share rights to directors, officers
and employees. In certain countries and in selected cases, cash equivalent awards are provided in the event that the issuance of equity awards is not compliant with local legislation
and tax laws.
Cash-Settled Awards
Cash-settled awards may be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company in lieu of, or in addition to, participation in other programs.
Such awards are accounted for as liabilities and are remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date.
Liabilities for cash-settled share-based compensation are as follows:
  June 30,
(in millions)  2019  2018
Total carrying amount of liabilities for cash settled arrangements  $ 2.7 $ 4.1
During fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company paid $2.3 million, $1.6 million and $3.9 million in cash, respectively, to settle these plans.
Equity-Settled Awards
Share Options
There were no share options granted in fiscal year 2019 as they were deferred due to the transaction with Bemis. In fiscal year 2018, share options were granted to officers
and employees. The exercise price for shares options was set at the time of grant.
The requisite service period for outstanding share options in fiscal year 2019 ranges from three to four years. The awards are also subject to performance and market
conditions. At vesting, share options can be exercised and converted to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to payment of the exercise price. The maximum contractual
term of the share options in fiscal year 2019 ranges from six to seven years from the grant date.
The fair value of the share options granted in fiscal year 2018 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following
table to produce a Monte Carlo simulation.
The fair value of share options granted was estimated using the following assumptions:
  June 30,
  2019 2018
Expected dividend yield (%) (1)  N/A 3.7%
Expected share price volatility (%) (2)  N/A 21.0%
Risk-free interest rate (%) (3)  N/A 2.1%
Expected life of options (in years) (4)  N/A 4.0
(1) Determined assuming no change in dividend payout during the expected term of the option.
(2) Determined based on the observed historical volatility for the Company's ordinary share price.
(3) Determined based on the yields on Australian Government Bonds in ef fect at the time of grant with maturities approximately equal to the share options' expected term.
(4) Determined considering the options' contractual terms, historical exercise and post-vesting termination patterns.
The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjusts compensation expense based on its probability assessment.

The aggregate intrinsic value (difference in exercise price and closing price at that date) for all share options outstanding at June 30, 2019 was $12.6 million. The aggregate
intrinsic value for share options vested and exercisable at June 30, 2019 was $6.8 million. The Company received $19.3 million, $28.1 million and $23.8 million and realized a tax
benefit of $5.5 million, $12.3 million and $22.8 million on the exercise of stock options during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the years ended
June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the intrinsic value associated with the exercise of share options was $8.3 million, $20.6 million and $37.0 million, respectively.
The weighted average grant date fair value of share options granted and the fair value of share options vested was as follows:

Restricted Shares
Restricted shares/ units may be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company and vest on terms as described in the award. The restrictions prevent the
participant from disposing of the restricted shares/ units during the vesting period.
The fair value of restricted shares/units is determined based on the closing price of the Company's shares on the grant date. Changes in the restricted shares/units for the year
were as follows:

Performance Rights and Performance Shares
    
There were no performance rights or performance shares (awarded to U.S. participants in place of performance rights) granted in fiscal year 2019 as they were deferred due
to the transaction with Bemis. In fiscal year 2018, performance rights or performance shares were granted to officers and employees.
The requisite service period for outstanding performance rights or performance shares in fiscal year 2019 ranges from three to four years. The awards are also subject to
performance and market conditions. At vesting, performance rights can be exercised and converted to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. Performance shares vest automatically
and convert to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. There is no amount payable by the participant.
The fair value of the performance rights and performance shares granted in fiscal year 2018 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the
assumptions noted in the following table to produce a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of the performance rights and performance shares was estimated using the following
assumptions:
  June 30,

Share Rights
Share rights may be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company and vest on terms as described in the award. The restrictions prevent the participant from
disposing of the share rights during the vesting period.
The fair value of share rights is determined based on the closing price of the Company's shares on the grant date, adjusted for dividend yield. Changes in the share rights for
the year were as follows:

Note 18 - Earnings Per Share Computations
The Company applies the two-class method when computing its earnings per share ("EPS"), which requires that net income per share for each class of share be calculated
assuming 100% of the Company's net income is distributed as dividends to each class of share based on their contractual rights.
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after excluding the
ordinary shares to be repurchased using forward contracts. Diluted EPS includes the effects of share options, restricted shares, performance rights, performance shares and share
rights, if dilutive.

Note 19 - Contingencies and Legal Proceedings
Contingencies
The Company's operations in Brazil are involved in various governmental assessments, principally related to claims for excise and income taxes. The Company does not
believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under customary local
regulations, the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to any administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court system;
however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact the liquidity of Amcor. At June 30, 2019 and 2018, the
Company has recorded an accrual of $16.4 million and $15.1 million, respectively, included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and has estimated a
reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the accrual of $23.7 million and $22.7 million, respectively. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of
individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these matters may
differ from the Company's estimates.
As of June 30, 2019, Amcor provided letters of credit of $45.4 million and deposited cash of $14.0 million with the courts to continue to defend the cases.
Legal Proceedings
On April 18, 2019, prior to the closure of the Amcor and Bemis transaction, litigation funding firm, Burford Capital, notified Bemis on behalf of two shareholder funds
(BCIM Strategic Value Master Fund LP and BCIM SV SMA I LLC) that the funds would not accept the fixed exchange ratio for Amcor shares and instead intended to file a case
asking a Missouri state court to appraise the value of their Bemis shares and compensate them accordingly. On June 24, 2019, the Burford funds sent a formal written demand for
payment of the fair value of the funds’ shares. The Burford funds can file a lawsuit in Missouri state court between now and September 9, 2019. As no lawsuit has been filed as of
the date of this update, it is not possible to predict the potential exposure.
Three lawsuits brought by purported holders of Bemis stock against Bemis and Bemis directors and officers are pending in federal court in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York, in which plaintiffs are seeking damages for alleged violations of the Exchange Act of 1934 and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
regulations. Plaintiffs allege a failure to disclose adequately information in the proxy statement issued in connection with the Amcor-Bemis merger. The cases are: Dixon, et al. v.
Bemis Company, Inc. et al.; Nolan, et al. v. Bemis Company, Inc. et al.; and, Stein v. Bemis Company, Inc. et al., which were instituted on April 15, 2019, April 19, 2019, and April
17, 2019, respectively.
In addition, a purported holder of Bemis stock filed a putative derivative suit in the Cole County Circuit Court, Nineteenth Judicial District of Missouri, against Bemis
directors and Amcor, alleging that the directors breached fiduciary duties in connection with the Amcor-Bemis merger and that Amcor aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duty.
The case is Scarantino, et al. v. Amcor Limited, et al., which was instituted on April 19, 2019.
Amcor intends to defend the claims made in the pending actions. It is too early for Amcor to provide any reliable assessment of the likely quantum of any damages that may
become payable if its defense is unsuccessful in whole or in part. Although it is not possible at present to establish a reliable assessment of damages, there can be no assurance that
any damages that may be awarded will not be material to the results of operations or financial condition of Amcor.

Note 20 - Segments
The Company's business is organized and presented in the two reportable segments outlined below:
Flexibles: Consists of operations that manufacture flexible and film packaging in the food and beverage, medical and pharmaceutical, fresh produce, snack food, personal care, and
other industries.
Rigid Packaging: Consists of operations that manufacture rigid plastic containers for a broad range of predominantly beverage and food products, including carbonated soft drinks,
water, juices, sports drinks, milk-based beverages, spirits and beer, sauces, dressings, spreads and personal care items and plastic caps for a wide variety of applications.
Other consists of the Company's equity method investments, including AMVIG, undistributed corporate expenses, intercompany eliminations and other business activities.
Operating segments are organized along the Company's product lines and geographical areas and consist of the following: Flexibles Europe, Middle East and Africa;
Flexibles Americas; Flexibles Asia Pacific and Specialty Cartons, and Rigid Packaging. The four Flexibles operating segments (Flexibles Europe, Middle East and Africa; Flexibles
Americas; Flexibles Asia Pacific and Specialty Cartons) have been aggregated in the Flexibles reporting segment as they exhibit similar economic characteristics as they are in the
business of printing and flexible packaging of fast moving consumer products.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in connection with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company changed its measure of segment performance from adjusted operating
income to adjusted earnings before interest and tax ("EBIT") from continuing operations. The Company's chief operating decision maker, the Global Management Team ("GMT"),
evaluates performance and allocates resources based on adjusted EBIT from continuing operations. The Company defines adjusted EBIT as operating income adjusted to eliminate
the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance and to include equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies. The
GMT consists of the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer and his direct reports and provides strategic direction and management oversight of the day to day activities of
the Company.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those in the consolidated financial statements and are discussed in Note 2, "Significant Accounting
Policies." The Company also has investments in operations in AMVIG that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included
in segment net sales.

Note 21 - Deed of Cross Guarantee
The parent entity, Amcor plc, and its wholly owned subsidiaries listed below are subject to a Deed of Cross Guarantee dated June 24, 2019 (the "Deed") under which each
company guarantees the debts of the others:
Amcor Limited Amcor Holdings (Australia) Pty Ltd
Amcor Services Pty Ltd Techni-Chem Australia Pty Ltd
Amcor Investments Pty Ltd Amcor Flexibles Group Pty Ltd
Amcor Finance Australia Pty Ltd Amcor Flexibles (Australia) Pty Ltd
Packsys Pty Ltd Packsys Holdings (Aus) Pty Ltd
Amcor Flexibles (Dandenong) Pty Ltd Amcor Flexibles (Port Melbourne) Pty Ltd
Amcor European Holdings Pty Ltd Amcor Packaging (Asia) Pty Ltd
The entities above were the only parties to the Deed at June 30, 2019 and comprise the closed group for the purposes of the Deed (and also the extended closed group). No
parties have been added, removed or the subject to a notice of disposal since June 24, 2019. Since June 30, 2019, there has been no change in ownership of any of the above entities.
By entering into the Deed, the wholly owned subsidiaries, except for Amcor Limited, have been relieved from the requirement to prepare a financial report and directors’
report under ASIC Corporations (Wholly-owned Companies) Instrument 2016/785.  Amcor Limited (former parent entity of the Amcor Group) is ineligible to rely on ASIC
Corporations (Wholly-owned Companies) Instrument 2016/785 for fiscal year 2019 as a wholly-owned entity of Amcor plc because it was a disclosing entity for part of the relevant
fiscal year. However, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") has provided Amcor Limited with separate relief under ASIC Instrument 19-0555. Under this
Instrument ASIC has ordered that Amcor Limited does not have to comply with a number of Australian reporting requirements including the requirement to prepare and file a stand-
alone financial report in Australia.
The financial statements below are additional disclosure items specifically required by ASIC and represent the consolidated results of the entities subject to the Deed only.

Note 23 - Subsequent Events
On August 8, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the EC Remedy for total consideration of approximately $394.0 million. The sale will not result in a gain, as the
three plants acquired as part of the Bemis acquisition were recorded at fair value upon acquisition which approximated the purchase price.
On August 20, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $500.0 million on-market buy-back of ordinary shares and Chess Depositary Instruments ("CDIs").
Amcor intends to repurchase its ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and CDIs on the Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX") in proportion to the number
of shares and CDIs currently on issue.

Item 9. - Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. - Controls and Procedures
As disclosed in our prospectus filed with the SEC on March 25, 2019, during the course of preparing for our initial public offering, we identified two material weaknesses in
our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical AAS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. The first material weakness was related to our lack of
accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting in U.S. GAAP and disclosure and filing requirements of a U.S. domestic
registrant. We are currently in the process of remediating this material weakness and have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes of the material weakness. We have
hired additional financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP technical accounting and financial reporting experience, aligned our accounting policies and procedures with U.S.
GAAP, enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial close process, and begun technical training for accounting and finance personnel.
We also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end reporting process.
Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation and
reporting of financial information. We are currently in the process of remediating this material weakness by commencing a process to (i) identify those internal controls requiring
improved documentation of independent review over the completeness and accuracy of financial information under U.S. GAAP, (ii) implement enhanced standards designed to meet
the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (iii) review the design of applicable internal controls and assess any required amendments and (iv) increase the training of accounting
and finance staff in relevant areas.
We believe that these enhanced resources and processes, including the implementation of new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the material weaknesses, but
the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded, through testing, that these controls
are designed and operating effectively.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
of June 30, 2019. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed, and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
    
As discussed above, related to our internal controls over financial reporting, we have made significant progress in our remediation efforts, but the remediation of these
material weaknesses will not be evaluated until management performs its assessment of internal controls, at which time the material weakness will not be considered remediated until
the applicable remedial controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Therefore,
as a result of these material weaknesses, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June
30, 2019.
    
(b) Management's Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our
registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies.
96
(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
