PART I
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
The Company
With a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility
company in the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936,
the Company employs approximately 6,500 professionals who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to over 14 million people in 24
states. The Company conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services, collectively presented as the
“Regulated Businesses.” The Company also operates other market-based businesses that provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on
military installations, as well as municipalities. Individually, these market-based businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and are collectively presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K within
“Other,” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.
On December 9, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the Company sold all of the equity interests of the HOS subsidiaries. See Item 1—Business—Other—Sale
of Homeowner Services Group below and Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its New York subsidiary, see Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Sale of New York
American Water Company, Inc. below and Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American
Water” mean American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to “parent company” mean American Water
Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries.
Regulated Businesses
The Company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial,
public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers. The Company’s utilities operate in approximately 1,600 communities in 14 states in the United
States, with 3.4 million active customers in its water and wastewater networks. Services provided by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by
multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as public utility commissions (“PUCs”). Federal, state
and local governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality and water accountability matters. The Company reports the results of
the services provided by its utilities in the Regulated Businesses segment. Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses were $3,505 million for 2022,
$3,384 million for 2021 and $3,255 million for 2020, accounting for 92%, 86% and 86%, respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same
periods.
Presented in the table below is a geographic summary of the Regulated Businesses’ operating revenues and the number of customers the Company
serves, by type of service, for and as of the year ended December 31, 2022:
Operating Revenues (in millions) Number of Customers (in thousands)

Customers
The Company’s Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality
or any other entity that purchases the Company’s water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may
purchase the Company’s services for use by multiple individuals or businesses. Examples of these customers are homes, apartment complexes, businesses and
governmental entities.
The vast majority of the Company’s regulated water customers are metered, which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers’ water
usage, typically on a monthly basis. The Company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range
from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting
consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. The Company’s wastewater customers are billed
either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption.
Residential customers make up a substantial portion of the Company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates. The Company also serves
(i) commercial customers, such as food and beverage providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service
customers, where the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for
use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities, (iii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers, mining and production
operations, (iv) public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and
community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers.
The following chart depicts the allocation of the Company’s Regulated Businesses’ operating revenue of $3,505 million by type, including a breakout of
the total water services revenues by class of customer, for the year ended December 31, 2022:
(a) Includes water revenues from public authorities and other utilities and community water systems under bulk contracts.
(b) Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges, fees and rents.

generally result in service to multiple customers.
(b) The Company completed the sale of its New York subsidiary on January 1, 2022 and the sale of its Michigan subsidiary on February 4, 2022.
Customer growth in the Company’s Regulated Businesses is primarily from (i) adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water
and/or wastewater utility systems, (ii) population growth in its authorized service areas, and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and community water
systems.
Capital Investment
The Company plans to invest between $30 billion and $34 billion over the next 10 years for capital improvements, including acquisitions, to its
Regulated Businesses’ water and wastewater infrastructure, largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities. The
Company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement cycle in 2009 to an expected 110-year replacement cycle by 2027, which
it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2,100 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2023 and 2027. In addition, from 2023 to 2027, the
Company’s capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities is expected to increase, further seeking to address
infrastructure renewal, resiliency, water quality, operational efficiency, technology and innovation, and emerging regulatory compliance needs. Additionally, the
Company continues to invest significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets.
Regulation and Rate Making
The operations of the Company’s Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primary
responsibility of the PUCs being the promotion of the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority
might differ from state to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs
and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations,
mergers and acquisitions, and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and
can change over time. These policies will affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.
Periodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the PUC. The timing of rate case filings is
typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital
investment costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. The Company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag,” which is the
time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and the recognition in rates of that change.

Table of Contents
The Company’s Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag.
Presented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices:
Regulatory Practices Description States Allowed
Infrastructure replacement
surcharge mechanismsAllows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital investments made to
replace infrastructure necessary to sustain safe and reliable services for the Company’s customers. These mechanisms typically
involve periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency.IA, IL, IN, KY, MO, NJ,
PA, TN, VA, WV
Future test year A “test year” is a period used for setting rates, and a future test year describes the first 12 months that new rates are proposed to be
effective. The use of a future test year allows current or projected revenues, expenses and capital investments to be collected on a
more timely basis.CA, HI, IA, IL, IN, KY,
PA, TN, VA
Hybrid test year A historical test year sets rates using data from a 12-month period that ends prior to a general rate case filing. A hybrid test year
allows an update to historical data for “known and measurable” changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year.MD, MO, NJ, WV
Utility plant recovery
mechanismsAllows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period, instead of capitalizing an allowance for
funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). In addition, some states allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certain capital
projects and associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects.CA, IL, KY, PA, TN, VA
Expense mechanisms Allows changes in certain operating expenses, which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utility’s control, to be
recovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding.CA, HI, IL, IN, MD,
MO, NJ, PA, TN, VA
Revenue stability mechanisms Adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility recovers the revenues authorized in its general rate case, regardless of sales
volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers
to use water more efficiently.CA, IL
Consolidated tariffs Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically
interconnected. The consolidated tariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state, and is generally used to moderate
the price impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs, while lowering administrative costs for customers. Pennsylvania and West
Virginia also permit a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements.CA, IA, IL, IN, KY, MD,
MO, NJ, PA, VA, WV
Deferred accounting A regulator’s willingness to defer recognition of financial impacts when setting rates for utilities. All
The Company pursues enhancements to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments and to continue to
provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to its customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment using the regulatory practices described above
does not guarantee that the PUCs will accept the Company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case, and these regulatory practices may reduce, but not
eliminate, regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes. It is also the Company’s strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas
where they may not currently apply and enhance certain mechanisms where they already exist.
Acquisitions and Strategic Growth
The U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local
governments or governmental subdivisions. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as of 2017, approximately 84% of the water
market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98% of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned. The EPA also estimates, as of
2017, that there are over 50,000 community water systems and over 15,000 community wastewater systems in the United States, with approximately 80% of
the community water systems serving a population of 3,000 or less.
A fundamental aspect of the Company’s growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of water and/or wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areas
where the Company operates its Regulated Businesses, see Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
for additional information. The proximity of acquisition opportunities to the Company’s regulated footprint allows it to integrate and manage the acquired
systems and operations primarily using the Company’s existing management (although the Company typically retains the majority, if not all, of the employees
of the acquired systems) and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs. The Company’s current customer mix of 92% water
and 8% wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and consolidation, allowing the Company to add wastewater customers where it
already serves water customers. The Company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems
in its existing markets and, if appropriate, pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the Company does not currently operate its
Regulated Businesses. Before entering new regulated markets, the Company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the
opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to
its customers. The Company will also evaluate whether there is a line of sight to grow to sufficient scale in a new regulated market so that it can attain
efficiencies after entering a new domestic market.
Increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety, cybersecurity and water quality and water accountability regulations, the amount of
infrastructure in need of significant capital investment, financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements, among others, that may drive more
municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets.

Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc.
On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its New York subsidiary to Liberty Utilities (Eastern Water Holdings) Corp. (“Liberty”), an
indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated November 20, 2019, as
amended, by and among the Company, the Company’s New York subsidiary and Liberty (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), Liberty purchased from the
Company all of the capital stock of the Company’s New York subsidiary for a purchase price of $608 million in cash. The sale was approved by the New York
State Department of Public Service on December 16, 2021. The Company’s regulated New York operations had approximately 127,000 customers in the State
of New York. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Industry Legislation
On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “IIJA”) was signed into law and provides for up to $55 billion to aid in
improving the country’s ailing water infrastructure, including $23.4 billion for drinking water and wastewater, $15 billion for lead service line replacement
(through the drinking water state revolving fund), and $10 billion for the treatment of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) and other contaminants of
emerging concern. The IIJA also included a low-income assistance program, in which eligible low-income customers who receive their water from public and
private entities may participate. The Company has leveraged these funds throughout its service areas to benefit its customers.
In December 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, a $900 billion COVID-19 relief and $1.4 trillion U.S. government appropriations
package for 2021, which included $638 million for a low-income water assistance program and $2.8 billion for capitalization grants under the Clean Water and
Drinking Water state revolving funds.
In 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act (the “WQAA”), which sets operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey,
including municipal and investor-owned utilities with more than 500 service connections. This law imposes requirements in areas such as asset management,
water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydrant and valve maintenance. The WQAA requires the most senior water manager, or either
the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems, to certify that the
system meets the requirements under the WQAA. Enhanced WQAA legislation includes additional enforcement requirements for disclosure of results, requires
the sale of systems for prolonged violations and imposes new cybersecurity requirements and asset management plans. The new amendments, which provide
for both civil and criminal penalties for falsification of documents, were signed by the Governor with an effective date of November 8, 2021.
In 2018, Indiana passed a law to set minimum operational expectations for all water and wastewater utilities in the state, including municipal and
investor-owned utilities. The law requires water and wastewater utilities to conduct rate analyses, develop capital asset management plans and conduct
cybersecurity and water loss audits.
In 2020, Missouri enacted the Water Safety and Security Act, which requires small and medium-sized water providers to create cybersecurity, valve
inspection and hydrant inspection programs.
The Company’s regulated subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Virginia and West Virginia have access to utility valuation legislation and regulation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater
systems. The Company supports full optionality for municipalities, including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and
wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations of purchased property. Fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an
alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation, which allows the Company to offer municipalities a purchase price for their system
assets that is reflective of the assets’ fair market value, while providing the Company with increased opportunity to recover the purchase price over the life of
the purchased system assets, subject to PUC approval. In 2021, the Tennessee Public Utility Commission implemented acquisition valuation rules that include a
methodology to value water and wastewater assets based upon the new replacement cost of the assets less the depreciation, in addition to other valuation
methodology options.
Consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected.
Consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in a
jurisdiction. As a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility, support economies of scale for even the
smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the jurisdiction. Overall, the Company believes that consolidated tariffs bring cost-effective, high-quality
services to a larger number of customers. Eleven of the Company’s regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including
California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.

Competition
The Company’s Regulated Businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because (i) the Company operates in those
markets pursuant to franchises, charters, certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, “CPCNs”) issued by state
PUCs or other authorities, and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market
entry. However, the Company’s Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies, other investor-owned utilities, large industrial
customers with the ability to provide their own water supply/treatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets and/or making strategic
acquisitions. When pursuing acquisitions, the Company’s largest investor-owned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population
served, include Essential Utilities, Inc., American States Water Company and California Water Service Group. From time to time, the Company also faces
competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp., Eversource Energy, SouthWest Water
Company and Corix Infrastructure, Inc.
Condemnation and Eminent Domain
All or portions of the Regulated Businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the
following methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision
when the original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated
or from which it received its CPCN. The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent
with applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or the jurisdiction of the particular
CPCN.
As such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, the Monterey
water service system assets (the “Monterey system assets”) of the Company’s California subsidiary (“Cal Am”) are the subject of a potential condemnation
action by the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”) stemming from a November 2018 public ballot initiative. In 2019, the
MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey system assets’ total value plus
adjustments would be approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and
projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. In 2020, the MPWMD
certified a final environmental impact report, analyzing the environmental impacts of the MPWMD’s project to (1) acquire the Monterey system assets through
the power of eminent domain, if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system.
In February 2021, the MPWMD filed an application with the Local Agency Formation Commission of Monterey County (“LAFCO”) seeking approval
to become a retail water provider and annex approximately 58 parcels of land into the MPWMD’s boundaries. In June 2021, LAFCO’s commissioners voted to
require a third-party independent financial study as to the feasibility of an acquisition by the MPWMD of the Monterey system assets. In December 2021,
LAFCO’s commissioners denied the MPWMD’s application to become a retail water provider, determining that the MPWMD does not have the authority to
proceed with a condemnation of the Monterey system assets. On April 1, 2022, the MPWMD filed a lawsuit against LAFCO challenging its decision to deny
the MPWMD’s application seeking approval to become a retail water provider. For more information on the lawsuit against LAFCO, see Item 3—Legal
Proceedings—Proposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets — Local Area Formation Commission Litigation. By letter dated October 3, 2022, the
MPWMD notified Cal Am of a decision to appraise the Monterey system assets and requesting access to a number of Cal Am’s properties and documents to
assist the MPWMD with such an appraisal. Cal Am responded by letter on October 24, 2022, denying the request for access, stating that the MPWMD does not
have the right to appraise Cal Am’s system without LAFCO approval to become a retail water provider.
Also, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain
lawsuit against the Company in January 2013, seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. During a valuation trial held in
January 2023, the parties settled the lawsuit and the water agency dismissed the eminent domain case, and as a result the Company will retain the pipeline. As
part of the dismissal, the Company’s Illinois subsidiary and another subsidiary entered into a settlement agreement with the water agency agreeing to, among
other things, maintain through December 31, 2027 the utility-specific wholesale water rate passed through to customers of the pipeline, such that the rate,
exclusive of other pass-through charges, remains no higher than the current rate.

Table of Contents
Furthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which the Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property
owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of
damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, for example, lawsuits have
been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities
triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be
recovered from customers in rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could
respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that
exceed the limits of such insurance.
Water Supply and Wastewater Services
The Company’s Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to its customers and collect, treat,
transport and recycle wastewater. Typically, the Company does not own the water, which is held in public trust and is allocated to the Company through
contracts, permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. The
Company is dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtains its water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams;
from groundwater sources, such as wells and aquifers; and water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment the Company applies
varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations. Surface water sources typically require significant treatment,
while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only.
Presented in the chart below are the Company’s sources of water supply as of December 31, 2022:
Presented in the table below are the percentages of water supply by source type for the Company’s Top Five States for the year ended December 31,

The Company’s ability to meet the existing and future water demands of its customers depends on an adequate water supply. Drought, governmental
restrictions, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and
surface water. The Company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-
term. The geographic diversity of the Company’s service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather
extremes the Company might encounter in any particular service territory. For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average
weather, which may reduce the amount of source water available, while other areas the Company serves may experience wetter than average weather.
The Company evaluates quality, quantity, growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity to provide
water service to its customers. Water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that the
Company has adequate water supply, it uses long-term planning processes and maintains contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused
by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations. The Company reviews current climate science and global models related to temperature,
precipitation and sea level rise on an ongoing basis. Where actionable forecasts are available, the Company will use this information in its comprehensive
planning studies and asset management plans. These studies and plans, which are used by the Company to develop its asset management and system reliability
strategies, assess the climate risk and resiliency of the Company’s water and wastewater systems over short-, medium- and long-term time horizons, and
include evaluations of the availability of water supplies and system capacity against a number of different factors, projections and estimates.
In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, the Company employs models to determine safe yields under different
rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be
predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. In California, where the state has been experiencing a multi-year
drought, the Company utilizes multiple water supply options including numerous ground water wells in multiple aquifers as well as various long-term purchase
water agreements with regional water suppliers to optimize supplies while assuring resiliency during dry years. An example of the Company’s use of long-term
planning to ensure that it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in
California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a desalination plant, to be owned by the Company’s California subsidiary, and the
construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes the California subsidiary’s purchase
of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water
Pollution Control Agency) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to
eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). For
more information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions and Note 16—Commitments and
Contingencies—Contingencies—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then transported through a
sewer network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The
solid waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.
Seasonality
Customer demand for the Company’s water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall.
Customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As
such, the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year. Weather that is hotter and/or drier than average
generally increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water demand and can reduce
water operating revenues. Two of the Company’s jurisdictions, California and Illinois, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the Company
to collect state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period that is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of
weather variability. See —Regulation and Rate Making for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms.

Other
Other primarily includes the MSG business, which enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services
on various military installations. The Company also has four contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and
provide other related services through its Contract Services Group (“CSG”). Other also includes CSG, corporate costs that are not allocated to the Company’s
Regulated Businesses, interest income related to the seller promissory note and income from the revenue share agreement from the sale of HOS, eliminations
of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments related to acquisitions that have not been allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment. Previously,
the Company provided home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers through its former HOS business, which was sold on the
Closing Date. As a result of the sale of HOS, the categories which were previously shown as “Market-Based Businesses” and “Other” have been combined and
are shown as Other. The businesses included within Other are not subject to regulation by state PUCs and the services provided generally do not require
significant capital investment. Operating revenues for Other were $287 million for 2022, $546 million for 2021 and $522 million for 2020, accounting for 8%,
14% and 14%, respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.
Military Services Group
MSG operates on 18 military installations under 50-year contracts with the U.S. government as part of its Utilities Privatization Program. The scope of
these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset
replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to MSG is completed either through a
discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long-term recapitalization program performed over the life of the contract.
Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installation’s mission, and the
construction of these assets is funded by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital for these assets historically
has not been funded through the Company’s debt or equity issuances; rather, the Company has used limited working capital for short-term needs under these
contracts. In April 2018, the U.S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects under existing
contracts, but the U.S. Army’s implementation of this requirement on existing contracts has limited the need for such financing. However, recent U.S. Army
and Navy Utilities Privatization solicitations have included requirements for the successful bidder to finance discrete initial capital projects over either a five-
or ten-year period after project completion. Four of MSG’s current contracts require such capital project financing, which the Company is currently addressing
through internal sources of liquidity.
The contract price for four of MSG’s contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations, and
every three years thereafter. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period, to reflect changes in contract
obligations and anticipated market conditions. The remaining 14 contracts with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a
mechanism called “Economic Price Adjustment.” All 18 contracts could be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience
of the U.S. government, or as a result of default or non-performance by the MSG subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, pursuant to termination
provisions applicable to all of these contracts, MSG would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract, plus the contract
profit margin on incurred costs. MSG’s backlog of revenue associated with its contracts with the U.S. government is approximately $6.9 billion, with an
average remaining contract term of 40 years.
Sale of Homeowner Services Group
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company provided various warranty protection programs and other home services primarily to residential and smaller
commercial customers through its HOS operations. On the Closing Date, the Company sold all of the equity interests in its HOS subsidiaries to an indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary of funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, a global private equity advisory firm (the “Buyer”), for total consideration of approximately
$1.275 billion. See Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5—Acquisitions and
Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Competition
MSG faces competition from a number of service providers, including American States Water Company and Veolia Environnement S.A.

Table of Contents
Environmental, Health and Safety, Water Quality and Other Regulation
The Company’s water and wastewater operations, including the services provided by its Regulated Businesses, MSG and CSG, are subject to extensive
federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the provision of water and wastewater services,
particularly with respect to the quality of water the Company delivers to its customers, and the manner in which it collects, treats, discharges, recycles and
disposes of wastewater. In the United States, these regulations are developed under federal legislation including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Reduction of
Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, and under a variety of applicable state laws. Environmental, health and safety, and water quality
regulations are complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the federal standard.
For example, while the EPA has announced the intention to propose drinking water regulations for two PFAS compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA,
and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS) and issued non-enforceable lifetime Health Advisory Levels for PFOA, PFOS and two other PFAS compounds,
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has already established enforceable drinking water standards for three PFAS compounds (PFOA,
PFOS, and perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA) and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection also recently announced enforceable drinking
water standards for PFOA and PFOS in advance of the federal EPA proposed regulations. The Company is also subject to various federal, state, and local laws
and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the
cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety. PUCs also set conditions and
standards for the water and wastewater services the Company delivers.
The Company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices focused on compliance with environmental laws and
regulations and the effective use of natural resources, recognizing that drinking water standards have generally, over time, increased in number and become
increasingly more stringent. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, the Company’s capital and operating costs needed to comply with them will likely
increase. The Company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards to which its
operations are subject and the Company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring of water quality issues. The Company estimates
that it will make capital expenditures of approximately $800 million over the next five years, and $195 million in 2023 for environmental control facilities,
which the Company defines for this purpose as any project (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, water or land. The Company believes that
its operations are materially in compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations.
The Company’s operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, the Company’s water and
wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable
environmental requirements. The Company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its
off-site disposal of waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and
comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and
take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened
release of one or more hazardous substances. Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and
operators of such sites, may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Although the Company is not aware of any
material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional
costs to the Company. The Company’s facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and
inspections thereunder.
Safe Drinking Water Act
The Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the
levels of numerous, naturally occurring and manufactured chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues
to propose new rules. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants, the treatment systems that may be used for
removing those contaminants, and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for over 90 contaminants and water quality indicators for drinking
water, and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.
The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but the Company actively participates with the EPA and other water
industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge. See —Research and Development—Contaminants of Emerging Concern for
additional information.
13
Table of Contents
The Company is within the EPA’s time frame for compliance with standards and rules developed under the regulation of the Safe Drinking Water Act,
which includes sample collection, data analysis, and, in some instances engineering planning and implementation of treatment enhancements. Further, the EPA
is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants, including strontium, hexavalent chromium, fluoride, nitrosamines, some pharmaceuticals and
certain volatile organic compounds. The Company does not anticipate that any such regulations, if enacted, will require implementation in 2023.
Although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, the Company expects current
cost requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs
are not expected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with
environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the Company expects to
recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements.
Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act
In 1991, the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”) to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor
revisions in 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in
Drinking Water Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes, plumbing fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have
made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily in building plumbing, still remain in many
communities. The failure of certain water systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and
scrutiny, and in certain cases, has led to a number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those
systems and others. As part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects, the Company has started to replace lead service lines
(“LSLs”) in accordance with current scientific guidance. Also, the Company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with
current water quality regulatory requirements. On December 21, 2021, the EPA announced next steps to strengthen the regulatory framework on lead in
drinking water, including implementing the Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (“LCRR”) and indicated their intent to finalize a forthcoming Lead and Copper
Rule Improvements (“LCRI”) prior to October 16, 2024, the initial compliance date in the LCRR. The Company is executing an implementation strategy to
comply with the initial LCRR requirement to complete a lead service line inventory. Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with the LCRI will be
determined once the EPA finalizes the rule, but as previously noted, costs associated with compliance with federal water quality regulations have been
traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.
The Company currently estimates that less than 5% of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the Company or
customer portion of the service line. The Company is replacing LSLs as part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects. The
Company’s goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known LSLs in most of its service areas by
the end of 2030, at an estimated additional investment range of $600 million to $1.2 billion. The Company believes this will be attainable for most of its service
areas where public policy is supportive of this goal. The IIJA was signed into law in November 2021 and provides for up to $15 billion for lead service line
replacement through drinking water state revolving funds. The Company is awaiting further guidance on eligibility, the application process and the distribution
of these funds. With regard to future acquisitions, the Company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL removal goals
appropriate for those systems. The prioritization of LSL removal is dependent on several factors, including the Company’s planned water main and service line
renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities, LCR compliance monitoring results, and cooperation with its customers with respect to
replacing the customer-owned portion of the LSL as necessary. In certain cases, these and other factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for
replacement. Because replacing the external LSL in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the U.S. National Drinking Water
Advisory Council, the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, and the American Water Works Association, the Company’s preferred approach is to
replace the entire external LSL if lead is found on either the Company or customer portion of the service line; full LSL replacement is also consistent with the
LCRR. The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative is a diverse group of public health, water utility, environmental, labor, consumer and housing
organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at
the local level.

Clean Water Act
The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In
addition to requirements applicable to the Company’s wastewater collection systems, its operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the
NPDES permit program, the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection
systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance
could lead to significant fines and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and
renewing expiring permits, may impose time and cost burdens on the Company’s operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at the Company’s
facilities, some of which result in fines. The Company does not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or
financial condition. The EPA has identified leveraging wastewater discharge permitting and application of biosolids, or sewage sludge, containing PFAS as
areas of focus in its PFAS Strategic Roadmap. Individual states may also take action in these areas. As indicated previously, capital expenditures and operating
costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the
Company expects to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from any new requirements in these areas.
Research and Development
The Company’s Research and Development Program
The Company maintains an industry-leading research and development (“R&D”) program that is designed to enhance its services, support its
compliance activities, improve service quality and operational effectiveness, and provide environmental leadership. For more than three decades from its
inception, American Water’s R&D program has evolved into an industry-leading effort and has achieved numerous advancements in the science of drinking
water, wastewater, and desalination. Through laboratory and industry resources and the team’s expertise, efforts are focused on contaminants of emerging
concern, including but not limited to COVID-19, PFAS, Legionella, cyanotoxin-forming algal blooms, a variety of pathogens (for example, Cryptosporidium,
Giardia, enteric viruses, and various bacteria), microbial indicators and disinfection byproducts. The Company’s R&D personnel are located at the Company’s
corporate headquarters and at two laboratory testing facilities in New Jersey and Illinois, the latter housing its quality control and testing laboratory, which
supports the Company’s R&D activities through testing and analysis.
The Company continues to leverage its expertise and collaborates with the EPA and state agencies to help establish effective environmental, health and
safety, and water quality standards and regulations. This relationship includes the sharing of the Company’s research, such as its treatment and distribution
system optimization research and its national water quality monitoring data. The Company’s engagement with the EPA provides it with early insight into
emerging regulatory issues and initiatives, thereby allowing the Company to anticipate and to accommodate its future compliance requirements. The Company
also frequently engages with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other state environmental agencies, and national and international water research
foundations. The Company believes that continued R&D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as maintaining its
leadership position in the industry, which provides the Company with a competitive advantage as it seeks business and operational growth.
Contaminants of Emerging Concern
Contaminants of emerging concern include numerous chemicals such as PFAS, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotic
resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistant genes (ARG), endocrine disrupting compounds, microplastics and industrial chemicals, as well as certain naturally
occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected in drinking water supplies, for which the risk to the public’s health is not
fully understood and/or has not been assessed. Technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of these contaminants at trace levels.
The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels, has invited discussion about these contaminants among regulators and government agencies, which in
turn shapes the public’s perception of drinking water quality.
The Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 203 million registered chemicals, with an estimated 1,400 species of disease-causing microbes
that can affect humans. The Company is continually investigating new substances and contaminants, employing a team of scientists, engineers and public
health professionals to identify threats to its water supply, to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories, and to evaluate the benefits of alternative
or advanced treatment technologies. The Company utilizes water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to help detect
potential water supply contamination issues. Examples of the Company’s efforts include:
• monitoring impacts of environmental pathogen loads and removal through wastewater systems;
• characterizing factors that contribute to the formation of potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products to define best practices for their
mitigation;

buildings; in this regard, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics indicate that water-associated disease from Legionella is on the
rise, with exposure typically associated with customer-owned plumbing systems in large buildings;
• defining a framework to support management or possible future regulation of opportunistic pathogens;
• developing expanded monitoring methods for short-chain and fluorinated replacement PFAS and piloting treatment techniques;
• systematically investigating PFAS removal by treatment processes in a wide range of water matrices;
• leading a PFAS risk communication strategy for the water sector;
• using innovative technologies to detect and manage algal blooms to help prevent taste and odor events and cyanotoxins before they get to the
water treatment plant;
• monitoring of taste and odor issues that impact customer satisfaction using expanded analytical methods to detect compounds, and evaluating and
recommending treatment practices;
• implementing water source assessment tools, including sensors and data analytics, to evaluate and track chemical storage and aid in the
identification of source water contamination events;
• developing methodology and advanced measurement techniques for contaminants of emerging concern to investigate transport, occurrence and
treatment; and
• implementing activated carbon, biofiltration and ion exchange treatment to seek to control contaminants of emerging concern.

Human Capital Resources
Overview
The Company’s people are a critical part of its business, and the Company’s investment in its people begins with the recruitment of qualified and diverse
talent and continues throughout employment. The Company’s employee value proposition, called weCARE, is a central part of the Company’s human capital
resources mission and focuses on employee experience as an influencer of an employee’s opinions and emotional response about the Company as an employer.
Additionally, the Company believes that representing the communities in which it serves plays a key role in its ability to serve its customers and
improves its talent. To support this proposition, the Company promotes an inclusive culture where its employees are given the opportunity to develop to their
fullest potential and understand that they directly contribute to the Company’s ability to operate, grow, and serve its customers. The Company also believes that
investing in the safety, health and well-being of its employees is a key component of its people and culture goals, and that these investments allow employees
to generate great ideas, provide quality customer service and make a difference in the lives of the Company’s customers.
Employee Health and Safety
A longstanding value and strategy of the Company is safety. In this regard, the Company continues to focus on the safety of its employees and
contractors so that they may return home from work in the same, or better, condition than when they arrived. The Company strives for all employees to feel
emotionally safe, live a healthy lifestyle and be physically safe at work and at home. The Company assesses occupational health and safety to measure
performance across the entire organization, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero incidents, injuries and fatalities for the Company’s employees and
contractors.
To uphold the Company’s commitment to safety, the Company’s employees completed over 117,000 hours of employee safety training, including
physical security and cybersecurity training, during 2022. Additionally, through frequent labor-management meetings, the Company encourages open
exchanges to explore new ways to further enhance safety on the job. All employees are empowered to demonstrate safety leadership by taking the time they
need to complete a task safely and to use “Stop Work Authority” — the power to stop working immediately whenever they believe a task is unsafe — to
personally mitigate the hazard or issue or collaborate with management to create a safe situation. The Company believes that this Stop Work Authority is so
important that it is stated on the back of every employee’s identification badge.
For 2022, the Company had its lowest ORIR injury rate in its recorded history, achieving an 18.8% reduction in injuries compared to 2021, taking into
account a 7% decrease in labor hours due to the sales of HOS and the Company’s New York subsidiary. Also, the number of Days Away Restricted or
Transferred (“DART”) injuries decreased by 36.1% compared to 2021. This decrease shows a significant improvement in those injuries that have a higher
severity. For 2022, the Company’s ORIR was 0.85 (52 injuries) and its DART rate was 0.37 (23 injuries), compared to an ORIR of 0.97 (64 injuries) and a
DART rate of 0.54 (36 injuries) in 2021.

In 2022, American Water teams led by promoting safety leading indicator activities, including pre-job safety briefings and near miss reporting, and by
achieving internal Certified Safe Worker designations. Near miss reports, where employees report potential hazards or incidents in a safe and secure manner,
increased by 20% in 2022 over 2021, and 97% of near miss incident corrective actions were completed, with nearly 90% completed within 30 days. The
Company utilizes near miss reporting and timely corrective actions as key measurements of employee engagement and safety performance.
The commitment to safety as a strategic imperative also includes building a culture of well-being where all employees can feel emotionally safe and live
a healthy lifestyle. Through well-being education, the Company is able to encourage employees to take preventative actions and increase participation in annual
well-care exams and cancer screenings, which increased by over 4% during 2022, compared to 2021.
Employee and Workplace Reintegration
As an essential business that provides water and wastewater services, during 2022, the Company continued to focus on the care and safety of its
employees, contractors, vendors and others who work at or visit the Company’s worksites. The Company launched its employee and workplace reintegration
plan to bring its employees safely back to the workplace and in its field operations in the wake of easing of COVID-19-related restrictions by federal, state and
local governmental and health authorities. The Company instituted greater workplace flexibility, including hybrid work opportunities, where feasible. The
Company supported these reintegration efforts by keeping employees’ safety, health and emotional well-being as a top priority and by continuing to follow
guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as federal, state and local health authorities. The Company also continued to
provide employees with temporary medical and emotional health benefits as needed during 2022. To keep employees informed on the changing conditions
during reintegration and to support their emotional well-being, the Company held several all-employee podcasts featuring medical and emotional health
speakers who discussed the status of the pandemic, provided updates on vaccine and booster activity, and led sessions focused on workforce and personal
change management related to reintegration.
Inclusion, Diversity and Equity
During 2022, the Company continued to focus on creating a culture through its promotion of inclusion, diversity and equity. At all levels, the Company
strives to understand, respect, value and provide equal opportunity to each employee, and to foster an environment where employees’ differences are embraced
and celebrated. The Company holds as an essential concept the right of employees to proudly share their ideas and unique perspectives in an environment built
on mutual respect, equity and inclusion. The Company is committed to diversity among its workforce, executive and senior management leadership teams, by
reflecting the diversity of the communities in which the Company serves. The Company expects all leaders to lead with inclusion, diversity and equity.
In 2022, the Company included in its APP new workforce diversity performance goals designed to increase the representation of women and ethnic and
racial diversity in the Company’s workplace. The goals measure the percentage of female and racial/ethnic diversity among the Company’s workforce based on
voluntary self-identification. In addition, the Company continues to hold its leaders accountable for developing a diverse workforce by maintaining
management level representation goals.
In addition, in 2022, the Company introduced its DiversityatAW.com website to provide transparency and communicate progress on the Company’s
workforce diversity initiatives. This web site currently includes, among other information, the Company’s ID&E report, its EEO-1 data for 2021, key employee
diversity metrics (which are updated quarterly), and a discussion of the Company’s pay equity study and internal labor market analysis.
During 2022, 83.1% of the Company’s hiring candidate pools were diverse. Additionally, for 2022, approximately 46.4% of the Company’s internal
employee transfers and promotions were filled with a diverse individual, reflecting the Company’s commitment to employee development and career growth as
well as the Company’s focus on diversity, inclusion and equity. For purposes of these metrics, diversity refers to gender, race, ethnicity, disability,
veteran/military spouse status, and LGBTQ+ status, all based on voluntary, self-identified employee information.
The Company maintains active memberships with groups such as Hiring our Heroes, Military Spouse Employment Partnership, American Corporate
Partners, CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, Disability: IN, Paradigm for Parity, and Out and Equal, to further enhance its ability to recruit and retain
diverse employees. Among this year’s recognitions, the Company was designated as a 2022 Military Friendly® Silver Employer and recognized by Military
Times for its industry-leading efforts on hiring and supporting U.S. military veterans.
The Company was also a top scorer in the 2022 Disability Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year and was recognized by U.S. Veterans Magazine
as a veteran-friendly company and as an organization with a veteran-friendly supplier diversity program. The Company also received the 2022 DiversityInc
Top Utility recognition for 2022.

In keeping with the Company’s values, the Company does not tolerate discrimination, harassment or retaliation by or toward any employee, vendor,
customer or other person in its workplace. All employees are required to complete anti-harassment, workplace respect and dignity, unconscious bias and
inclusion and diversity training. In addition, annual Code of Ethics training is provided to all employees, which includes instructions on using the Company’s
anonymous hotline for reporting potential Code of Ethics violations.
The Company’s four Employee Business Resource Groups (“EBRGs”), which represent diverse employee demographics (Women, African
American/Black, LGBTQ+ and Disabilities/Caregivers), strive to create measurable and long-lasting positive impacts on employees’ careers, as well as the
Company’s culture and communities in which it serves. EBRG members participate in community events throughout the year, which highlight the importance
of supporting community partnerships. For example, employees participated in the annual Juneteenth Unity Walk that supported the National Alliance on
Mental Illness, an organization that provides advocacy, education, and support for, and public awareness of, mental illness.
Total Rewards
American Water’s health and well-being programs are approached holistically by offering the following benefits, among others: medical, prescription,
dental, vision, disability, a retirement savings plan, and life insurance coverage, as well as a health and wellness program and a menu of additional voluntary
benefits. The Company’s Total Rewards programs are designed to reflect many aspects of employee health and well-being, cultivate an inclusive workforce,
and motivate, attract and retain talent to seek to achieve the Company’s strategic business priorities.
As part of Total Rewards, the Company provides a comprehensive compensation and benefit program designed to recognize the vital roles the
Company’s employees play. Further, all the Company’s employees, including those who are union-represented, participate in the APP, to promote alignment
between performance-based compensation and the Company’s short-term performance goals. As part of its commitment to providing an inclusive and equitable
culture for all employees, the Company regularly reviews pay equity to make sure pay decisions are based on the responsibilities, talents and skills of our
employees, rather than, factors such as gender, race or ethnicity.
All employees who average 30 hours or more per week receive full-time benefits. Approximately 90% of all benefit eligible employees are enrolled in
the Company’s healthcare benefits. Full-time employees pay approximately 16% of the total cost of medical, dental and vision coverage. Additional medical
benefits include coverage for applied behavior analysis, autism treatment, transgender services and hearing aids, as well as a fertility assistance benefit. The
Company also offers additional employment benefits, including holiday, vacation and sick time, which are at levels generally greater than or equal to those
offered by other companies in the utility industry.
Every five years, the Company negotiates national health and welfare benefits with its union-represented employees. On November 30, 2022, a five-year
extension of the Company’s national benefits agreement with its union-represented employees was reached and ratified, effective through July 2028. See —
Workforce Data below for more information. The extension agreement includes, among other things, a revised benefit cost sharing allocation, six weeks of paid
family leave, an increase in the target payout under the APP for covered employees, and coverage for infertility treatment beginning in plan year 2025.
Talent Development
The Company partners with business leaders to understand the key behaviors and competencies required to operate safely and effectively, and to foster
professional growth with the goal to create and deploy programs designed to attract, motivate, develop and retain talented employees, and foster a learning
culture. The Company also requires every employee, including its union-represented employees, to complete a minimum of 25 hours of training each year.
Approximately 96.7% of active full-time employees hired before October 1, 2022, met this requirement for 2022, with over 302,000 hours of total training
completed during the year. In addition to required role-based training, managers assist employees to identify professional development opportunities, utilizing a
framework of on-the-job learning, social learning, and formal learning, to help them reach their full potential and grow their careers.
Developing talent to provide a pathway to executive leadership is a critical priority for the Company. During 2022, the Company engaged in succession
planning activities for the Company’s business-critical and business-impact positions. These succession plans aid in providing continued leadership for the
growth and future of the Company’s business, while also seeking to promote diversity, retention and development. In addition to succession of executive and
senior leadership roles, in 2022, the Company initiated talent reviews, which served to identify critical skills and competency areas as well as top and emerging
talent with a focus on diversity, and supported a discussion of strengths, gaps and development plans. Talent reviews were conducted for a select group of
employees, including employees who are being assessed for senior leadership or other critical roles.

Employee Experience
The Company has established its weCARE employee value proposition that focuses on employee experience as an influencer of an employee’s opinions
and emotional response about the Company as an employer. weCARE is composed of five elements: deeper connections; personal growth; shared purpose;
flexibility; and well-being. weCARE represents the Company’s commitment to value its employees and build a safe, healthy and inclusive culture where every
employee knows their value and is appreciated for their talents and commitment to supporting the Company’s success. The Company offers employees
programs covering each of the five components of weCARE. The Company is committed to improving the employee experience by listening to employees
through focus group discussions and employee surveys, among other tools. To that end, the Company captures employee feedback, which helps the Company
understand how employees are feeling and permits appropriate refinement of the Company’s employee programs, benefits and support.
In early 2022, the Company introduced a new development role of Culture Champion. Each Culture Champion is responsible for partnering with their
local leadership and managing and communicating local activities and actions that seek to advance the Company’s culture.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS
We operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other
information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following material factors should be considered in evaluating our
business and future prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position,
results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations
Our Regulated Businesses are subject to extensive regulation by state PUCs and other regulatory agencies, which significantly affects our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our Regulated Businesses also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for an
inability to meet these regulatory requirements.
Our Regulated Businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state PUCs. This
regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and operations. Generally, the state PUCs authorize us to
charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, including, but not limited to, operating and maintenance
costs, depreciation, financing costs and taxes, and provide us with the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital.
Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rate
increase applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved,
or may be partially approved, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, a PUC may not approve a rate request in an amount that is
sufficient to:
• cover our cost of operations, including: purchased water; chemicals; and fuel, power and other commodities used in our operations;
• cover our operational labor and labor-related expenses, including without limitation costs and expenses associated with our pension and other
post-employment benefits;
• enable us to recover our investment; and
• provide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.
Approval by the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our Regulated Businesses, which are required to have numerous permits,
approvals and certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions, dispositions, debt and/or equity financing, and, in certain
cases, affiliated transactions. Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financial penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules
and regulations. Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary
for its existing operations, we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business.
In any of these cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if the rates
approved are sufficient, we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs. This could
occur if certain conditions exist, including, but not limited to, (i) water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates, (ii) customers increase their
conservation efforts, (iii) we experience unusual or emergent situations, events or conditions (including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic), or (iv) our
investments or expenses prove to be higher than the levels estimated in establishing rates. It may be difficult to predict the outcome or impact of these events
on us or the actions that may be taken by the PUCs or other governmental authorities in response thereto.
Our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety
laws and regulations, including with respect to contaminants of emerging concern, compliance with which could impact both our operating costs and
capital expenditures, and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs, as well as damage to our reputation.
Our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These requirements include, among others,
CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the LCRR and other federal and state requirements. For example, state PUCs and environmental
regulators set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. If we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not
comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws, regulations or permits, or other health and safety and water quality regulations, we
could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well as damage to our reputation. In the most serious cases, regulators could reduce
requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality. Given the nature of our
business which, in part, involves providing water service for human consumption, any potential non-compliance with, or violation of, environmental, water
quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more
25
Table of Contents
significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry.
In addition, CERCLA authorizes the EPA to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial
actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances, and can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, on responsible
parties for the costs thereof. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations.
We incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental, water quality and health and safety laws and
regulations. These laws and regulations and their enforcement, have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increase our
costs. Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our Regulated Businesses through customer rates, there can be no guarantee that the
various state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs
or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
We may also incur liabilities if, under environmental laws and regulations, we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination,
including potential releases of hazardous chemicals, such as chlorine, which we use to treat water, or at off-site locations where we have disposed of residual
waste or caused an adverse environmental impact. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future,
could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such remediation costs may
not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.
Attention is being given to contaminants of emerging concern, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have
any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered (including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and
detection of trace amounts of substances). Examples of sources of contaminants include, but are not limited to, newly created chemical compounds (including,
for example, manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds; bacteria, microbes, viruses
(including COVID-19), amoebae and other pathogens; and residual by-products of disinfection. We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate
regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants, and our role is to provide service that meets these standards, if any. In some of our
states, PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or in part, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for a contaminant in the absence of a
regulatory standard. Furthermore, given the rapid pace at which these contaminants are being created and/or discovered, we may not be able to detect and/or
mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of
operations and reputation. In addition, we believe these contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and
requirements in the future, which could significantly increase the cost of our operations.
Limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies because of government regulation or action may adversely affect
our access to sources of water, our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services.
Our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water. As a general rule,
sources of public water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams, groundwater aquifers and recycled water sources, are held in the public trust and are not
generally owned by private interests. As a result, we typically do not own the source water that we use in our operations, and the availability of our water
supply is established through allocation rights (determined by legislation or court decisions) and passing-flow requirements set by governmental entities or by
entering into water purchase agreements. These requirements, which can change from time to time, and vary by state or region, may adversely impact our water
supply. Supply issues, such as drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit
the availability of ground and surface water. If we are unable to secure available or alternative sources of water, our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
For example, in our Monterey County, California operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with the
cease and desist orders issued by the SWRCB in July 1995 and October 2009 (the “1995 Order,” the “2009 Order” and, as amended in July 2016, the “2016
Order” and, collectively, the “Orders”) that require Cal Am to significantly decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction
schedule that terminated on December 31, 2021. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, which
includes additional information regarding this matter. We are also required to augment our Monterey County sources of water supply to comply with the
requirements of the Endangered Species Act. For 2022, Cal Am complied with the diversion limitations contained in the 2016 Order, but continued compliance
with these limitations in 2023 and future years may be impacted by a number of factors, including without limitation continued drought conditions in California
and the exhaustion of water supply reserves, and will require successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand.
While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the
Orders may result in material
26
Table of Contents
additional costs or obligations, including fines and penalties against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the Orders, which could have a material
adverse effect upon us and our business, results of operations and cash flows.
Service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural or other disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the
demand for our water services, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Service interruptions due to severe weather, climate variability patterns and natural or other events are possible across all our businesses. These include,
among other things, storms, freezing conditions, high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, drought, wildfires, coastal and
intercoastal floods or high water conditions, including those in or near designated flood plains, pandemics (including COVID-19) and epidemics, severe
electrical storms, sinkholes and solar flares. Weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities, limiting or
preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers, or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage.
Tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not provide reimbursement to us, in whole or in part, for any of
these impacts.
Government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers,
which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Seasonal and other drought conditions, including, for example, those
currently being experienced in California, that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas. Governmental restrictions imposed in
response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system. Responses may range from
voluntary to mandatory water use restrictions, rationing restrictions, water conservation regulations, and requirements to minimize water system leaks. While
expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant PUC determines they were
reasonable and prudent, we cannot be certain that any such expenses incurred will, in fact, be fully recovered. Moreover, reductions in water consumption,
including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist even after a drought has ended and restrictions are lifted,
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of
which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise.
The issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. There is consensus among climate scientists that there will be
worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions present several potential challenges to
water and wastewater utilities, including us, such as:
• increased frequency and duration of droughts;
• increased precipitation and flooding;
• increased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events;
• challenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;
• potential degradation of water quality;
• decreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns;
• increases in disruptions in service;
• increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or
• increased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency and severity of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and
reliability of our water and wastewater treatment and conveyance facilities and systems.
Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Furthermore, laws and regulations have been enacted or proposed that seek to reduce or limit greenhouse gas
emissions and require or would require additional reporting and monitoring, and these regulations may become more pervasive or stringent in light of changing
governmental agendas and priorities, although the exact nature and timing of these changes is uncertain. Although some or all potential expenditures and costs
associated with the impact of climate variability and related laws and regulations on our Regulated Businesses could be recovered through rates, infrastructure
replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms, there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such
expenditures and costs, in whole or in part.

The current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as “regulatory lag,” from the time that we invest in infrastructure
improvements, incur increased operating expenses as a result of inflation or other factors, incur increased cost of capital, including as a result of
increasing short- and long-term rates, or experience declining water usage, to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case
applications; our inability to mitigate or minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business.
There is typically a delay, known as “regulatory lag,” between the time our Regulated Businesses make a capital investment or incur an operating
expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. In addition, billings permitted by state PUCs typically are, to a considerable extent, based
on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate. Thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by
declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag
could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
We endeavor to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory practices. For example, two of our states have approved revenue
stability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, including
recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, 10 of
our state PUCs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such
as replacement of aging infrastructure. These surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures,
and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rates, nine of our
state PUCs allow us to use future test years, which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and
investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis. Other examples of such regulatory practices include expense mechanisms that allow us to increase
rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control, such as purchased water costs, property or other taxes, or power, conservation, chemical or other
expenditures. These mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under a general rate case
application process without the mechanisms.
While these mechanisms have mitigated or reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek approval of regulatory practices
to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved them. Furthermore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharges and existing
mechanisms may not continue in their current form, or at all, or we may be unable or become ineligible to continue to utilize certain of these mechanisms in the
future. Although we intend to continue our efforts to seek state PUC approval of constructive regulatory practices to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag, our
efforts may not be successful, or even if partially successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be materially
and adversely affected.
Changes in laws and regulations can significantly and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
The impact of any future revisions or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to our
Regulated Businesses is uncertain. Changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws and regulations, changes in enforcement practices of
regulators, government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations, results of operations and cash flows. Certain of the individuals who
serve as regulators are elected or political appointees. Therefore, elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also
result in changes of the individuals who serve as regulators and changes in the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new
interpretations of existing laws or regulations, changes in agency policy, including those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed
during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences, among others:
• making it more difficult for us to increase our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;
• changing the determination of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases and other regulatory
proceedings;
• restricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided or limiting our bill collection
efforts;
• requiring us to provide water or wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;
• limiting or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems, purchase or dispose of assets, or issue long-term debt or equity, or
making it less cost-effective for us to do so;
• negatively impacting, among other things: (i) tax rates or positions or the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, (ii) the
availability or amount of, or our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of, tax credits or tax
28
Table of Contents
abatement benefit, (iii) the amount of taxes owed, (iv) the timing of tax effects on rates or (v) the ability to utilize our net operating loss
carryforwards;
• changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;
• increasing the associated costs of, or difficulty complying with, environmental, health, safety, consumer privacy, water quality, and water quality
accountability laws and regulations to which our operations are subject;
• changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;
• making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process,
or for governmental agencies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes;
• increasing the costs or difficulty of complying with proposed changes to federal contractor affirmative action audits;
• placing limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a
regulated subsidiary and us or our other affiliates, including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries;
• restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and
• revoking or altering the terms of a CPCN issued to us by a state PUC or other governmental authority.
Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs and liabilities.
The wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks. If
collection, treatment or disposal systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated or inadequately treated wastewater or other contaminants could
spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. This risk is
most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such
damage could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain of our wastewater systems have
commercial and industrial customers that are subject to specific limitations on the type, character and strength of the wastewater they are permitted to discharge
into our systems. The failure by these commercial and industrial customers to comply with their respective discharge requirements could, in turn, negatively
impact our operations, damage our facilities or cause us to exceed applicable discharge limitations and requirements. Liabilities resulting from such exceedance
events could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
A loss of one or more large industrial or commercial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our
Regulated Businesses.
Adverse economic conditions may cause our customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, to curtail operations. A curtailment of
operations by such a customer typically results in reduced water usage by that customer. In more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be
permanent. Any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations. Tariffs in place with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.
Our Regulated Businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments, experience
increases in short- and long-term interest rates or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects.
The water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive. We invest significant amounts of capital to add, replace and maintain property, plant and
equipment, and to improve aging infrastructure. In 2022, we invested $2.3 billion in net Company-funded capital improvements. The level of capital
expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will continue into the future and, we believe, will increase. We expect to fund capital
improvement projects using cash generated from operations (including, among other things, a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of HOS) borrowings
under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of long-term debt and equity. We may not be able to access our revolving
credit facility or the commercial paper, long-term debt and equity capital markets, when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms
or at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing, we may be unable to maintain our existing property, plant and equipment, fund our capital investment
strategies or expand our rate base to enable us to meet our growth targets. Even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we
face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time, as a result of supply chain interruptions, construction delays, permitting
delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, legal and regulatory challenges, or other obstacles. Each of these outcomes could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Aging infrastructure may lead to service disruptions, property damage and increased capital expenditures and O&M expenses and other costs, all of which
could negatively impact our financial results.
We have risks associated with aging infrastructure, including water and sewer mains, pumping stations and water and wastewater treatment facilities.
Additionally, we may have limited information regarding buried and newly acquired assets, which could challenge our ability to conduct efficient asset
management and maintenance practices. Assets that have aged beyond their expected useful lives may experience a higher rate of failure. Failure of aging
infrastructure could result in increased capital expenditures and O&M expenses and other costs, and negatively impact our future O&M efficiency ratio. In
addition, failure of aging infrastructure may result in property damage, and in safety, environmental and public health impacts. To the extent that any increased
costs or expenditures are not fully recovered in rates, our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted.
Seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues.
The volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to
increased water usage for irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other applications. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically
warmer months, the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the
typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our
revenues.
Two of our jurisdictions, California and Illinois, currently have revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to recover the revenues authorized in a
general rate case, regardless of sales volume. Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to recognize declining sales resulting from reduced consumption,
while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism, our
operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality.
Contamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to
substances not typically found in potable water supplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations,
government enforcement actions, damage to our reputation and private litigation.
The water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system, or the water service that is provided to our
customers, may be subject to contamination, including, among other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater
systems, pollution resulting from manufactured sources (such as perchlorate, perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds, methyl tertiary butyl ether, 1,4-
dioxane, lead and other materials, or chemical spills or other incidents that result in contaminants entering the water source), and possible terrorist attacks or
other similar incidents. In addition, new categories of contaminants continue to emerge in the water industry. If one of our water supplies or the water service
provided to our customers is contaminated, depending on the nature of the contamination, we may have to take responsive actions that could include, among
other things (1) limiting use of the water supply under a “Do Not Use” protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire
protection, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply, in whole or in part, potentially impacting basic sanitation and fire protection needs. If service is
disrupted, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant
costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new
treatment methods. We may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance, customer rates, tariffs or
contract terms, and any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner.
Moreover, we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption
of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings for information on certain
pending lawsuits related to interruptions of water service.
Since we are engaged in the business of providing water service to our customers, contamination of the water supply, or the water service provided to
our customers, could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation.
Such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and
may be brought by our customers or third parties. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do
occur. We may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts of these claims in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. Negative impacts to
our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to
contamination or hazardous substances within the water supply or distributed finished drinking water. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover all or a
portion of these losses, and are subject to deductibles and other limitations. Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased
regulatory oversight or sanctions.
Our business and operations have a large direct and indirect customer base and, as a result, we are exposed to public criticism regarding, among other
things, the reliability of water service, wastewater and related or ancillary services, the quality of water provided, and the amount, timeliness, content, accuracy
and format of bills that are provided for such services. Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment arising out of our operations may render legislatures
and other governing bodies, state PUCs and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light, and may cause us
to be susceptible to less favorable legislative, regulatory and economic outcomes, as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more stringent
regulatory or economic requirements. Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations
governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to MSG, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements.
The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows and liquidity.
The properties of our Regulated Businesses segment include 73 dams, the majority of which are earthen dams. The failure of any of these dams could
result in personal injury and property damage, including without limitation downstream property damage, for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam
would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such
losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.
We also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has
been material. The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could
entail material costs. Although in most cases the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be
able to recover costs of repairs, upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future. The inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a
result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes, water mains and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our
financial condition and reputation.
Our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes, water mains and storage systems located
across the United States. A failure of major pipes, mains or reservoirs could result in injuries, property and other damage for which we may be liable. The
failure of major pipes, mains and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such
failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery
requirements prescribed by government regulators, including state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be
recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future. Moreover, to the extent such business
interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance, they may not be recovered through rate adjustments.
An important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems, which involves risks, including competition for acquisition
opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities and other buyers, which may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business.
An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current, and
move into new, service areas. We may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach
mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates, and whether or not any particular acquisition is successfully completed, these activities are expensive and
time consuming and are subject to the availability of capital and personnel resources to complete such acquisitions.
Further, competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities and other strategic and financial buyers may
hinder our ability to expand our business. As consolidation activity increases in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions continues
to increase, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions.
The negotiation and execution of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could
require us to incur significant costs, cause diversion of our management’s time and resources and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
Future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:
31
Table of Contents
• unanticipated capital expenditures;
• unanticipated acquisition-related expenses;
• incurrence or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities and obligations, including liabilities that were unknown or
undisclosed at the time of acquisition;
• failure to recover acquisition adjustments or premiums due to unfavorable decisions by PUCs and other governmental authorities;
• failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;
• recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;
• fluctuations in quarterly and/or annual results;
• failure to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; and
• difficulties in integrating or assimilating acquired systems’ operations, personnel, benefits, services and systems and water quality, cybersecurity
and infrastructure protection measures.
Some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business. The systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve
anticipated revenue, return on equity or profitability, or other perceived synergies, and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere
with our operations, reduce our net income and profitability or adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Our Regulated Businesses are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process, which could
materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition.
Municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States,
and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to convert our assets to public
ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain, or another similar authorized process. A municipality, other
government subdivision or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either directly or indirectly as a result
of a citizen petition.
For example, in November 2018, Monterey, California ballot Measure J, which was added by a citizens group, was certified as having been approved by
a public vote, requiring the MPWMD to conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the Monterey system
assets without an additional public vote. The public vote led to the issuance by the MPWMD of (i) a preliminary report finding, among other things, that the
acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible, and (ii) a final environmental impact report analyzing the
environmental impacts of such an acquisition through the power of eminent domain. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Condemnation and
Eminent Domain and Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Proposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets — Local Area Formation Commission Litigation, which
includes additional information regarding these matters.
Furthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which our Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property
owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of
damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in
connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the
natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of
such lawsuits.
Contesting an exercise of condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or responding to a citizen petition, may result in costly legal
proceedings and may divert the attention of management. Moreover, our efforts to resist the condemnation, eminent domain or other process may not be
successful, which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property
damage suffered. If a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our Regulated Businesses through
eminent domain or other process, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the
compensation, or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges. Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.
We may be subject to physical and cyber attacks.
As operators of critical infrastructure, we may face a heightened risk of physical and cyber attacks from internal or external sources. Our water and
wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks, acts of
32
Table of Contents
war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. Our operational and technology systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or
internal access, due to hacking, viruses, acts of violence, war or terrorism, and other causes. Unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored
on these systems could negatively and materially impact our reputation, customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including
vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber
attacks and unauthorized access to their operational or technology systems. While we have instituted safeguards to protect our operational and technology
systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. We cannot guarantee that such
protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.
If, despite our security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and
customer and other confidential information lost or stolen; we could experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; we could
suffer a loss of management time, attention and resources from our regular business operations; we may be subject to increased regulatory requirements; and
we may experience litigation and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
Experiencing a physical or cyber security incident could also cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to
report cybersecurity incidents or breaches or securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory
fines or penalties. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance
related costs. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, about
our customers and employees. In many cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that have been and will continue to be targets of
cyber attacks. Any theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack on us or a vendor could also subject us to
significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.
We have obtained insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a physical attack, cyber attack or a security
breach, but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by an attack or a breach. Furthermore, the
market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events will likely evolve as the industry matures. In the future,
adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable, and the costs of responding to and recovering from a physical attack, cyber
attack or security breach incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.
Our business is subject to complex and evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding consumer privacy and the protection or transfer of
data relating to individuals, which could result in, among other things, public disclosure of incidents, private or governmental claims or litigation against
us, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, reputational harm and increased cost of operations.
Laws and regulations are changing and increasing rapidly with respect to data and consumer privacy, security and protection. We are subject to an
increasing number of complex and continually evolving data and consumer privacy, security and protection laws and regulations administered by various
federal, state and local governments, including, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, together with its amendments and implementing
regulations, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022. New laws and regulations may
require us to disclose incidents to authorities, regulators and/or the public, when we otherwise may not have been required to disclose such incidents under
previous laws and regulations, and such disclosures could negatively and materially impact our reputation, customers, employees, suppliers and other third
parties. Federal and state governments have also adopted or are proposing other limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use,
security and storage of personally identifiable information. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general are applying federal and state
consumer protection laws to impose standards on the collection, use and dissemination of data. Moreover, we expect that current laws, regulations and industry
standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States will continue to evolve and increase, and we cannot determine the
impact that compliance with such future laws, regulations or standards will have on us or on our business. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with
current or future federal, state, or local data or consumer privacy or security laws, regulations, policies, guidance, industry standards, or legal obligations, or
any incident resulting in unauthorized access to, or the acquisition, release, or transfer of, personally identifiable information or other data relating to our
customers, employees and others, may result in private or governmental enforcement actions, litigation or other claims against us, fines and penalties, or
adverse perception or publicity about us and our businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and could result in us
incurring substantial costs. These events could also require us to change our business practices, and the events or such changes may result in significant
diversions of resources, distract management and divert the focus and attention of our security and technical personnel from other critical activities. Any of the
foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
33
Table of Contents
condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
We may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.
We maintain insurance coverage, some of which may be self-insured, as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential
liabilities arising from our Regulated Businesses, as well as the operations of MSG and CSG. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits, exclusions
and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. Generally, our insurance policies cover property damage, worker’s
compensation, employer’s liability, general liability, cybersecurity, terrorism risks and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured
retentions and policy limits for covered claims. As a result, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage, or for which
we are self-insured and must therefore utilize our own financial resources to cover such losses. Although in the past we have been generally able to obtain
insurance coverage related to our business, there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such
insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium
costs or deductibles.
We rely on technology to facilitate the management of our business as well as our customer and supplier relationships, and a failure or disruption of
implemented technology could materially and adversely affect our business.
Technology is an integral part of our business and operations, and any failure or disruption of the technology or related systems we implement could
significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business effectively and efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position
to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We use technology systems to, among other things, bill customers, process orders, provide customer
service, manage certain plant operations and construction projects, create and manage our financial records and other operational data, track assets, remotely
monitor our plants and facilities, and manage human resources, supply chain, inventory, and accounts receivable collections. As a specific example, we depend
on water meters to record and communicate the amount of water our customers use, which information in turn is used to generate customer bills, and in recent
years, we have experienced greater than expected performance failures with certain water meters used in the Regulated Businesses. When failures occur, we
work with meter manufacturers to determine and address the cause of such failures. While these and other failures that we have experienced have not to date
had a material adverse effect on our operations, there can be no assurance that efforts to address performance failures or other issues we may experience with
water meters or other implemented technology will be successful in the future and that these or future failures of water meters or other technological issues will
not have a material adverse effect on us.
Although we do not believe that the technology we have implemented or may in the future implement is at a materially greater risk of failure than that
used by other similar organizations, our technology and operations that use or rely on technology remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among
other things: failure or interruption of the technology or its related systems; loss or failure of power, internet, telecommunications or data network systems; and
operator error or improper operation by, the negligent or improper supervision of, or the intentional acts of, employees, contractors and other third parties. Any
or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
An inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
A significant part of our long-term strategic plan focuses on safety, operational excellence, cost and expense efficiency (including O&M expense
efficiency), water quality and affordability, asset and capital management and the customer experience. For example, we have made and plan to continue to
make significant investments in developing, deploying, integrating and maintaining customer-facing technologies, applications to support field service and
customer service operations, water source sensor and evaluation technologies, meter data management and analytics, and intelligent automation technologies.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in designing, developing, deploying, integrating or maintaining these new technologies. Because these
efforts can be long-term in nature, these new technologies may be more costly or time-consuming than expected to design, develop, integrate and complete and
may not ultimately deliver the expected or desired benefits upon completion. While we have and will continue to seek to recover costs and earn a return on
capital expenditures with respect to the costs and expenses of development and deployment of these new technologies in our Regulated Businesses, there can
be no assurance that we will be able to do so in every instance or at all, and our inability to do so may adversely affect our ability to achieve intended cost and
expense, including O&M expense, efficiencies or other key performance results and, ultimately, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expected
costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations and profitability.
Upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of
management’s time and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors,
including employees’ ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system. We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and
customer interactions, and have installed new, and upgraded existing, technology
34
Table of Contents
systems. Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those
anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal control over financial reporting. We may
also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems, which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or
efficiently. Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that all such impacts have
been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could harm our business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Disruptions in our supply chain related to goods, such as pipe, chemicals, power and other fuel, equipment, water and other raw materials, and services,
could adversely impact our operations and our ability to serve our customers, as well as our financial results.
Our ability to serve our customers and operate our business in compliance with regulatory requirements is dependent upon purchasing or securing
necessary goods and services from our suppliers and vendors. These items include but are not limited to contracted services, chemicals, pipe, valves, hydrants,
fittings, equipment (including personal protective equipment), water, and power and other fuel. Examples of supply chain disruptions include reduced
quantities of goods available in the marketplace, delays in manufacturing or shipping goods, labor shortages at our suppliers or vendors, natural or other
disasters and operational impacts to some of our suppliers or vendors. Disruptions in our supply chain related to goods and services have occurred and we
anticipate will continue to occur into the foreseeable future. For example, a recent fire at a plant owned by the sole supplier of permanganate in the Western
Hemisphere has severely limited the U.S. supply of potassium and sodium permanganate, two chemicals used by water utilities to treat water. The Company is
seeking to utilize alternative methods of treatment and to manage its existing supplies of permanganate, but any inability to source sufficient quantities of these
chemicals or utilize alternative chemicals may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to comply with applicable environmental and regulatory
requirements.
Supply chain disruptions may cause us to be unable to purchase or otherwise obtain needed goods or services at a reasonable price or at all, and may
significantly increase the price of goods and services we may obtain from suppliers and vendors. This, in turn, may adversely impact our operations and our
ability to serve our customers in compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as our associated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
While we attempt to plan for and have contingencies in place to address supply chain disruptions, our mitigation efforts may not be successful or may have
further negative impacts on us.
Our business has inherently dangerous work sites. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce or customer injuries or loss of life,
and be exposed to financial losses, including penalties and other liabilities.
Safety is a core value and a strategy at American Water. Our safety performance and progress to our ultimate desired goal of zero injuries are critical to
our ability to carry out our operations effectively and to serve our customers, and thereby, to support our reputation. We maintain health and safety practices to
protect our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and the public. Eliminating all hazards all of the time is extremely challenging, but through strict
adherence to our health and safety practices, and empowering employees to be safety leaders who are instructed to and expected to stop work if deemed
“unsafe,” we believe we can achieve an injury-free workplace.
At our business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, our employees, contractors and others are often in close proximity to large
mechanical operating equipment, moving vehicles, pressurized water, electric and gas utility lines, below grade trenches and vaults, electrical and pneumatic
hazards, fall from height hazards, suspended loads, hazardous chemicals and other regulated materials. On many sites, we are responsible for safety and,
accordingly, must implement important safety procedures and practices above governmental regulatory requirements. As an essential business that provides
water and wastewater services, we are focused on the health and safety of our employees, contractors, vendors, customers and others who work at or visit our
worksites. If the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others, or we fail to implement procedures, our employees,
contractors and others may experience illness, or minor, serious or fatal injuries. Unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover, expose us
to litigation and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
In addition, our operations can involve the delivery, handling, storage, use and disposal of hazardous chemicals, which, if improperly delivered, handled,
stored, used or disposed of, could result in serious injury, death, environmental damage or property damage, and could subject us to penalties or other
liabilities. We are also subject to various environmental, transportation and occupational health and safety regulations. Although we maintain functional
employee groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective environmental health and safety work procedures and practices throughout our organization,
including construction sites and operating facilities, the failure to comply with these regulations or procedures could subject us to liability.
Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations and the ability to serve our customers.
35
Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 47% of our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 75 collective bargaining agreements in place
with 14 different unions representing our unionized employees. These collective bargaining agreements, 18 of which will expire during 2023, are subject to
periodic renewal and renegotiation. We may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts, or enter into new agreements, on terms that
are acceptable to us. Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor
actions or work stoppages. Labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages, and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during
renegotiations, may disrupt our operations, negatively impact the ability to serve our customers, and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect
our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. While we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary
if a work stoppage or strike does occur, a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.
Financial, Economic and Market-Related Risks
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to
generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs.
As of December 31, 2022, our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements)
was $12.4 billion, and our working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was in a deficit position. Our indebtedness could have important
consequences, including:
• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;
• exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;
• limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;
• impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;
• requiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt,
thereby reducing funds available for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;
• limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or
industry conditions; and
• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.
During 2022, we utilized existing sources of liquidity, such as our current cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our
commercial paper program, to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. We believe that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash
requirements for the foreseeable future. In order to meet our capital expenditure and other operational needs, however, we may be required to borrow additional
funds under the revolving credit facility. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need to obtain additional sources of liquidity, which would
require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. Moreover, additional borrowings may be required to repay or refinance outstanding
indebtedness. Debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2023, 2024 and 2025 will be $281 million, $476 million and $598 million, respectively. We can
provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms, if at all, to repay or refinance this debt. Moreover, as
new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify, limiting our ability to repay or refinance existing debt on favorable
terms.
We have in the past entered into, and in the future may enter into, financial derivative instruments, including without limitation, interest rate swaps,
forward starting swaps and U.S. Treasury lock agreements. See Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. However, these efforts
may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk, and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties, including quarterly “mark to market” valuation risk
associated with these instruments, that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance, which will be affected by
the financial, business, economic, competitive, legislative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and
other risk factors described in this section, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on
our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell
additional equity. In addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to
enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating
results and prospects to be affected materially and adversely.
36
Table of Contents
Our inability to access the debt or equity capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our long-term commitments or liquidity
needs at reasonable cost, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
In addition to cash from operations, during 2022, we relied primarily on a revolving credit facility, which was increased from $2.25 billion to $2.75
billion in October 2022, a commercial paper program, which was increased from $2.10 billion to $2.60 billion in October 2022, and the debt capital markets, to
satisfy our liquidity needs. The revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its terms in October 2027. Historically, we have regularly used our
commercial paper program rather than the revolving credit facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we
generally could obtain in the commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility,
$1,177 million of commercial paper outstanding and $78 million in outstanding letters of credit. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to
access this commercial paper program or revolving credit facility, when, as and if desired, or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to
meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable, or any, cost.
Our ability to comply with covenants in our revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties,
including events beyond our control. For example, under the terms of the revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated
capitalization, as determined under the terms of the facility. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that causes us to exceed this limit,
lenders under the facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt thereunder immediately due and
payable. Events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significant write-down of our goodwill. To avoid such a default, a waiver or
renegotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our
operational and financing flexibility. Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility
could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate
opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete.
In order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we intend to issue a combination of short-term and long-term debt securities and/or additional equity
shares of common stock. Disruptions in the debt or equity capital markets or changes in our credit ratings or other events could limit our ability to access
capital on terms favorable to us or at all. While the lending banks that participate in the revolving credit facility have to date honored their commitments under
those facilities, disruptions in the credit markets, changes in our credit ratings, or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or
prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. In such a case,
we may not be able to access the commercial paper, debt or equity capital markets, or other sources of potential liquidity, in the future on terms acceptable to us
or at all. Furthermore, our inability to maintain, renew or replace commitments under our revolving credit facility could materially increase our cost of capital
and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Short- or long-term disruptions or volatility in the debt or equity capital and
credit markets as a result of economic, legislative, political or other uncertainties, including as a result of changes in U.S. tax and other laws, reduced financing
alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the capital necessary to provide adequate liquidity for our
business. Significant volatility or disruptions in the debt or equity capital or credit markets, or financial institution failures, could require us to take measures to
conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures could include delaying or deferring capital expenditures,
reducing or suspending dividend payments, and reducing other discretionary expenditures. Finally, even absent significant volatility or disruptions in the capital
markets, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access markets to obtain capital or financing when necessary or desirable and on terms that are
reasonable or acceptable to us.
The occurrence of any of these circumstances could expose us to increased interest or other expense, require us to institute cash or liquidity conservation
measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, which may limit or
impair our ability to achieve our strategic, business and operational goals and objectives.
Parent company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable
to pay upstream dividends or repay funds.
Parent company is a holding company and, as such, it has no substantive operations of its own. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by
subsidiaries. Parent company’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and
cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to parent company. Prior to paying dividends to parent company,
our regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations, including, for example, debt service and preferred and
preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations and agreements, and our covenants and other agreements. Our
subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay or upstream dividends to parent company. A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries
to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent company’s ability to pay dividends
on its common stock and meet its other obligations.

We have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible and other assets, and we may be required to record impairments or changes in fair value to these
assets, which may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our assets as of December 31, 2022 included $1.1 billion of goodwill and $347 million of total assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis. The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003. Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is recorded at fair value on
the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As
required by the applicable accounting rules, in the past, we have taken significant non-cash charges to operating results for impairments to goodwill or other
intangible assets, and have recorded changes in fair value of financial instruments and other assets. We may be required to recognize in the future an
impairment of goodwill or a change in fair value of financial instruments or certain other assets due to market conditions, other factors related to our
performance or the performance of an acquired business, or other circumstances that may impact the fair value of a financial instrument or the other asset. See
Note 18—Fair Value of Financial Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the fair value of financial and other
assets. These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of
comparable water utilities, market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies, decreases in control premiums,
or other circumstances. A decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or
interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of goodwill and changes in fair value of certain of our other assets would
result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment or change occurred, which may negatively affect our financial condition, results of
operations and total capitalization. The effects of any such impairment or change could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit
ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators.
Market volatility and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities, as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans, which
may require us to provide significant additional funding.
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and
postretirement benefit plans. The value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations and volatility, which may cause investment returns to fall below our
projected return rates. A decline in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets as of the measurement date or a change in the
projection of the future return on plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, our
pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rates have experienced volatility and are subject to potential
further adjustments based on the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and others. If interest rates are lower at the current measurement date than the prior
measurement date, our liabilities would increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in assumptions, such as
increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements. Future increases in pension and
other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in which case our results of operations and financial position
could be negatively affected. In addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and
postretirement plans. For example, a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding
requirements. To the extent that the discount rate used in our assumptions is reduced, our benefit obligations could be materially increased, which could
adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Additional Risks Related to Other Businesses
Parent company provides performance guarantees with respect to certain of the obligations of our Other businesses, including financial guarantees or
deposits, which may adversely affect parent company if the guarantees are successfully enforced.
Under the terms of certain agreements under which our Other businesses, primarily MSG, provide water and wastewater services to municipalities and
federal governmental entities, parent company provides guarantees of specified performance obligations, including financial guarantees or deposits. In the
event these obligations are not performed, the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against parent company or
proceed against the deposit. In that event, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. At December 31,
2022, we had remaining performance commitments, as measured by remaining contract revenue, totaling approximately $6.9 billion related to MSG’s
contracts, and this amount is likely to increase if the number of military bases served by MSG increases. The presence of these commitments may adversely
affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms.
MSG’s operations are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the U.S. government.
MSG enters into contracts with the U.S. government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems, which contracts may be
terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the
subsidiary performing the contract. In addition, the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to either an annual economic price
adjustment, or a price redetermination two years after commencement
38
Table of Contents
of operations and every three years thereafter. Annual economic price adjustment is an inflation index-based contract price increase mechanism. Price
redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and market
conditions. Any early contract termination or unfavorable annual economic price adjustment or price redetermination could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, entering into contracts with the U.S. government subjects us to a number of operational and
compliance risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security
regulations. We are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security
regulations, which are complex, and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of
an investigation, we could be suspended or debarred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the U.S. government or our existing contracts
could be terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
General Risk Factors
New accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash flows and
financial condition.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other
authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to
change our accounting policies or critical accounting estimates. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact
how we report our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could
also adversely affect our previously reported results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure.
Our internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions
and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP, taxation requirements, federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and
regulations applicable to us. We have also implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and relevant SEC rules, as well as other applicable regulations. Such internal controls and policies
have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and Board of Directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws, rules and
regulations. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the
effectiveness of these controls. While we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated or
unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors
that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and non-compliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have a negative
impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to
the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also harm our reputation, increase financing costs or adversely affect our ability to
access the capital markets.
Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to attract, hire and retain highly qualified, skilled and/or diverse talent.
The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to attract, hire and retain highly qualified, skilled and/or diverse talent, including engineers,
licensed operators, water quality and management professionals who have the desired experience and expertise. Similar to other organizations, the Company
may have challenges implementing its human capital management and employee succession plans to attract and retain such talent based on a number of factors
including, among others, market conditions, retirements and geography. If we are unable to meet these human capital resource challenges, our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted.
Our business may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees and contractors.
Our Code of Ethics requires employees and contractors to make decisions ethically and in compliance with applicable law and regulatory requirements,
and our Code of Ethics and its underlying policies, practices and procedures. All employees are required to complete training on and review the Code of Ethics
on an annual basis, and violations of the Code of Ethics could result in disciplinary actions up to, and including, termination. Despite these efforts to prevent
misconduct, it is possible for employees or contractors to engage in intentional misconduct and violate laws and regulations through, among other things, theft,
fraud, misappropriation, bribery, corruption and engaging in conflicts of interest or related person transactions, or otherwise committing serious breaches of our
Code of Ethics and our policies, practices and procedures. Intentional misconduct by employees or contractors could result in substantial liability, higher costs,
increased regulatory scrutiny and significant reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions
Compliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions
Under the 2009 Order, Cal Am is required, among other things, to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according
to a set reduction schedule. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Water Supply and Wastewater Services and Item 1A—Risk Factors. The 2009
Order responded to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the Carmel River as
required by the 1995 Order issued by the SWRCB. In July 2016, at the request of Cal Am and several Monterey County government agencies, the SWRCB
issued the 2016 Order approving a deadline of December 31, 2021 for Cal Am’s compliance with the 2009 Order.
40
Table of Contents
The 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased
use of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use. In 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued a
decision directing modifications in Cal Am’s tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 Order, and directing Cal Am to seek written guidance
from the SWRCB with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition. In 2012, the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent
a letter to Cal Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses. In March
2018, the MPWMD adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCB’s written interpretation. In May
2018, Cal Am notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the
2009 Order. In an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention, Cal Am has met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB
several times. The SWRCB agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter, which would be subject to a public comment period. Any failure to
follow the MPWMD’s resolution or the SWRCB’s written interpretation, despite these conflicting interpretations, could potentially result in fines, penalties and
other actions against Cal Am.
Following issuance by the Coastal Commission in November 2022 of a coastal development permit, as described below, Cal Am continues to work
constructively with all appropriate agencies to obtain the remaining required permits for the Water Supply Project. However, there can be no assurance that the
Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Cal Am has complied
with the diversion limitations contained in the 2016 Order. Continued compliance with the diversion limitations in 2023 and future years may be impacted by a
number of factors, including without limitation continued drought conditions in California and the exhaustion of water supply reserves, and will require
successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The 2009 Order and the 2016 Order remain in effect until Cal
Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River
diversions. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to
comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order in the future may result in material additional costs and obligations to Cal Am, including fines and penalties
against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order.
Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project
CPUC Final Approval of Water Supply Project
Cal Am’s ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the CPUC and other
government agencies, obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision to authorize
Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to the incurred $50
million in associated costs plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria.
In 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUC’s requirements for a CPCN and
an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUC’s 2018 decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the
best project to address estimated future water demands in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Am’s cost
estimates for the Water Supply Project, which amounted to an aggregate of $279 million plus AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Am’s actual financing
costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Am’s prudently incurred costs associated with the Water Supply Project upon
its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps, O&M costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters. The
reasonableness of the Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed by the CPUC when Cal Am seeks cost recovery for the Water Supply Project. Cal Am is also
required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the Water
Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUC costs associated with that program, and
reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service. Cal Am has incurred $206 million in aggregate costs as
of December 31, 2022, related to the Water Supply Project, which includes $51 million in AFUDC.
In September 2021, Cal Am, Monterey One Water and the MPWMD reached an agreement on Cal Am’s purchase of additional water from an expansion
to the GWR Project, which is not expected to produce additional water until 2024 at the earliest. The amended and restated water purchase agreement for the
GWR Project expansion is subject to review and approval of the CPUC, and in November 2021, Cal Am filed an application with the CPUC that sought review
and approval of the amended and restated water purchase agreement. Cal Am also requested rate base treatment of the additional capital investment for certain
Cal Am facilities required to maximize the water supply from the expansion to the GWR Project and a related Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project, totaling
approximately $81 million. This requested amount was in addition to, and consistent in regulatory treatment with, the prior $50 million of cost recovery for
facilities associated with the original water purchase agreement, which was approved by the CPUC in its unanimous 2016 final decision.
41
Table of Contents
On December 5, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision that authorizes Cal Am to enter into the amended water purchase agreement, and specifically to
increase pumping capacity and reliability of groundwater extraction from the Seaside Groundwater Basin. The final decision sets the cost cap for the proposed
facilities at approximately $62 million. Cal Am may seek recovery of amounts above the cost cap in a subsequent rate filing or general rate case. Additionally,
the final decision authorizes AFUDC at Cal Am’s actual weighted average cost of debt for most of the facilities.
On December 30, 2022, Cal Am filed with the CPUC an application for rehearing of the CPUC’s December 5, 2022 final decision. Cal Am is requesting
inclusion in the cost cap all infrastructure costs for the GWR Project expansion that were not included in the final decision. Cal Am believes that the December
5, 2022 final decision is contrary to the CPUC’s precedent and that obtaining recovery of these infrastructure costs is a key component of the GWR Project
expansion and Cal Am’s ability to meet the future water supply needs of its customers in Monterey. This application remains pending.
While Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, as well as the
CPUC’s 2016 and 2018 final decisions, Cal Am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply
Project and there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the $112 million in aggregate construction
costs, plus applicable AFUDC, previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 and December 2022 final decisions. See Note 16—Commitments and
Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Coastal Development Permit Application
In 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application (the “Marina Application”) to the City of Marina (the “City”) for those project
components of the Water Supply Project located within the City’s coastal zone. Members of the City’s Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons,
have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the
Planning Commission of the Marina Application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the Coastal Commission, as permitted under the City’s code and
the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application (the “Original Jurisdiction Application”) to the Coastal Commission for a coastal
development permit for those project components located within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction. After Coastal Commission staff issued reports
recommending denial of the Original Jurisdiction Application, noting potential impacts on environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands and possible
disproportionate impacts to communities of concern, in September 2020, Cal Am withdrew the Original Jurisdiction Application in order to address the staff’s
environmental justice concerns. The withdrawal of the Original Jurisdiction Application did not impact Cal Am’s appeal of the City’s denial of the Marina
Application, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. In November 2020, Cal Am refiled the Original Jurisdiction Application.
On October 5, 2022, Cal Am announced a phasing plan for the proposed desalination plant component of the Water Supply Project. The desalination
plant and slant wells originally approved by the CPUC would produce up to 6.4 million gallons of desalinated water per day. Under the phased approach, the
facilities would initially be constructed to produce up to 4.8 million gallons per day of desalinated water, enough to meet anticipated demand through about
2030, and would limit the number of slant wells initially constructed. As demand increases in the future, desalination facilities would be expanded to meet the
additional demand. The phased approach seeks to meet near-term demand by allowing for additional supply as it becomes needed, while also providing an
opportunity for regional future public participation and was developed by Cal Am based on feedback received from the community.
On November 18, 2022, the Coastal Commission approved the Marina Application and the Original Jurisdiction Application with respect to the phased
development of the proposed desalination plant, subject to compliance with a number of conditions, all of which Cal Am expects to satisfy. Cal Am continues
to seek the remaining permits necessary to construct the Water Supply Project.
On December 29, 2022, the City, Marina Coast Water District (“MCWD”), MCWD’s groundwater sustainability agency (“GSA”), and the MPWMD
jointly filed a petition for writ of mandate in Monterey County Superior Court against the Coastal Commission, alleging that the Coastal Commission violated
the California Coastal Act and the California Environmental Quality Act in issuing a coastal development permit to Cal Am for construction of the MPWSP
slant wells. Cal Am is named as a real party in interest. This matter remains pending.
Subject to the impact or resolution of this litigation, construction of the desalination plant is expected to begin in 2024 and the desalination plant is
estimated to be in-service by the end of 2027.
Desalination Plant Development Permit
The proposed desalination plant for the Water Supply Project is to be located in an unincorporated portion of Monterey County, California, on a site
owned by CEMEX, Inc. (“CEMEX”), and requires a combined development permit from Monterey County prior to commencement of construction. In April
2019, Monterey County’s Planning Commission voted to approve the permit. In July 2019, the Board of Supervisors heard appeals filed by MCWD and a
public advocacy group, at which time it denied the appeals and
42
Table of Contents
approved the permit. In August 2019, MCWD filed a petition in Monterey County Superior Court challenging Monterey County’s approval of Cal Am’s
combined development permit application and seeking injunctive relief to enjoin Monterey County and Cal Am from commencing construction of the
desalination plant. In October 2019, after a hearing, the court denied, without prejudice, MCWD’s motion for a preliminary injunction, but issued a stay of
Monterey County’s approval of the combined development permit, precluding commencement of physical construction of the desalination plant, but allowing
Cal Am to continue to obtain permits needed for the desalination plant’s construction. In January 2021, the court issued its decision granting in part and
denying in part MCWD’s petition. The court found that Monterey County did not completely comply with all of the requirements necessary to approve the
combined development permit and set aside its approval so that Monterey County could come into compliance. The court denied all of MCWD’s other claims.
The court also lifted its stay on physical construction at the plant site.
In May 2021, Cal Am filed a notice of appeal as to the Monterey County Superior Court’s January 2021 decision, seeking to challenge the court’s
decision on Monterey County’s statement of overriding considerations. Monterey County filed a notice of appeal as to the same issue in May 2021. In June
2021, MCWD filed cross-appeals on its claims that had been denied by the court. These appeals remain pending.
Proposed Zoning Changes at CEMEX Site for Slant Wells
In August 2018, the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance, and placed the
matter for consideration on the Planning Commission’s agenda for its September 2018 meeting. The proposed amendments would change zoning at the
CEMEX site to open space and restrict future uses, including with respect to Cal Am’s planned use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project.
Any change to the City’s local coastal program must ultimately be approved by the Coastal Commission. Cal Am, CEMEX and the Coastal Commission each
submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments. At its November 2018 meeting, the Planning Commission adopted a resolution recommending that the
Marina City Council consider approving the amendments.
In December 2018, the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments. Cal Am, CEMEX and the Coastal Commission again submitted
letters opposing the proposed changes, but the City Council unanimously adopted a resolution amending its local coastal plan and a draft amendment to its
zoning ordinance. Changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final, which occurred at the City’s December 2018 meeting. The
changes to the local coastal plan must be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained.
Test Slant Well Permitting
A preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability
of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under Monterey Bay. In November 2014, the Coastal Commission approved coastal
development permits for the test slant well, enabling Cal Am to construct and operate the test slant well. Effective February 28, 2018, test slant well pumping
ceased, except for minimal maintenance pumping activities, in accordance with Cal Am’s coastal development permits. Because Cal Am may use the test slant
well as one of the slant wells for the Water Supply Project, Cal Am sought and obtained from the Coastal Commission permit amendments to allow the test
slant well to remain in place and be maintained until February 28, 2024. A required lease obtained from the California State Lands Commission, as amended,
expired on December 16, 2022. Cal Am has filed an applications for extension of the State Lands Commission lease. This application remains pending.
Water Supply Project Land Acquisition and Slant Well Site Use
In July 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned
by CEMEX on which intake wells for the Water Supply Project will be located, to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a non-profit or
governmental entity. The consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves Cal Am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistent
with existing easements and other rights of record. A permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am was recorded in June 2018 to allow Cal Am access to
the property and to construct, operate and maintain the Water Supply Project intake wells. in November 2019, the City notified CEMEX that, based on this
permanent easement and Cal Am’s proposed use of the site for the intake wells, CEMEX has breached or will soon breach a prior 1996 annexation agreement
(to which Cal Am was not a party). The City states that it intends to seek declaratory relief from CEMEX and Cal Am ordering that Cal Am’s extraction is
limited to 500 acre-feet per year of groundwater, that Cal Am cannot export extracted water out of the basin, and that the permanent easement granted by
CEMEX to Cal Am is void. CEMEX has denied the City’s claims and requested indemnification from Cal Am under the terms of the permanent easement. Cal
Am and CEMEX believe that there is no valid limitation under the annexation agreement on Cal Am’s right to pump brackish groundwater and seawater at the
site for desalination and use by Cal Am’s customers.
In May 2020, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court, naming Cal Am and CEMEX as defendants, and MCWRA and MCWD as
real parties in interest. The lawsuit, as amended, alleges a claim for breach of contract against CEMEX and seeks declaratory relief to void the permanent
easement and prohibiting extraction of water by Cal Am’s slant wells at the CEMEX
43
Table of Contents
site in excess of 500 acre-feet per year and the export of such water outside the groundwater basin. In November 2020, Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA filed
demurrers, which were overruled by the court at a hearing held in February 2021.
In August 2020, MCWD filed a cross-complaint in the May 2020 lawsuit against Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA, alleging claims for specific
performance of certain provisions of the 1996 annexation agreement related to the property owned by CEMEX on which intake wells for the Water Supply
Project will be located, as well as claims of water rights, nuisance and unreasonable water use, and seeking additional declaratory relief. Following various
rulings on demurrers filed by Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA, in February 2021, the court sustained, without leave to amend, the demurrer to MCWD’s
nuisance claim and overruled the remainder of the demurrers. In October 2021, the court granted a motion filed by Cal Am related to MCWD’s cross-
complaint, which motion requested a referral of certain issues related to MCWD’s water rights and unreasonable use claims to the SWRCB for its expert
advisory opinion. The SWRCB has scheduled hearings on the referred issues before its Administrative Hearing Officer, which took place in the fourth quarter
of 2022 and are set to continue into early 2023. The Monterey County Superior Court has set a trial date of October 23, 2023, for the City’s lawsuit.
Challenges Related to Compliance with California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act
Under California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (“SGMA”) enacted in 2015, groundwater basins designated by the state as critically
overdrafted must be managed by a GSA by 2020 in accordance with an approved groundwater sustainability plan (“GSP”) designed to achieve sustainability by
2040. Under the SGMA, GSAs have broad powers to achieve sustainability including, but not limited to, regulating groundwater extraction by imposing fees
on groundwater extractions and controlling groundwater extractions by regulating, limiting or suspending extractions from wells. The 400-acre CEMEX site
overlies a small portion of the 180/400 Subbasin of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin; the 84,000-acre 180/400 Subbasin has been designated by the state
as critically overdrafted, mainly due to seawater intrusion into the subbasin.
In late 2016, the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency (the “SVBGSA”) was formed as a joint powers authority to become the GSA
for the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin and prepare a GSP. In April 2018, the City filed a notice to become the GSA for the CEMEX site, creating an overlap
with the SVBGSA’s filing for the 180/400 Subbasin. In 2016, the SVBGSA commenced preparation of a GSP covering the entire 180/400 subbasin, including
the CEMEX site, but in August 2019 the City filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own GSP for the CEMEX site with the intent to severely limit or
prohibit groundwater pumping at that site. The State Department of Water Resources (“SDWR”) has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved, it will
not accept the GSP from either agency, placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management. In December
2019, the County of Monterey filed its own notice to become the exclusive GSA at the CEMEX site in order to resolve the overlap, which is permitted under
SGMA. SDWR accepted Monterey County’s filing in December 2019, and now lists Monterey County as the exclusive GSA for the site.
In December 2019, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court challenging Monterey County’s filing, and SDWR’s acceptance of the
filing, as the exclusive GSA for the CEMEX site. The City has named Monterey County and its Board of Supervisors, its GSA, and SDWR and its director as
defendants, and the SVBGSA and its Board of Directors as real parties. The City seeks to invalidate Monterey County’s filing, as well as injunctive relief to
preserve the City’s status as a GSA for the site. To protect its interest in the matter, Cal Am filed an application to intervene in this lawsuit, which was granted.
Monterey County filed cross-claims against the City and SDWR. After a hearing, in August 2021, the court denied the claims brought by the City and granted
Monterey County’s cross-claims, finding that the City’s GSA notice was untimely, the Monterey County GSA was the exclusive GSA for the CEMEX site, and
the SVBGSA’s GSP was properly adopted for the entire 180/400 subbasin, including the CEMEX site. In November 2021, the City appealed this decision, and
in December 2021, Monterey County appealed the court’s decision as to the finding that the City’s action creating a GSA was not void.
In September 2020, Cal Am filed a separate but related complaint in Monterey County Superior Court challenging the validity of actions taken by the
City and its GSA in adopting a groundwater sustainability plan for the CEMEX site, and the validity of the provisions of such plan. Due to the overlap of issues
in the City’s lawsuit with those in the validation action, the parties stipulated to a stay of the validation action pending determination of the claims in the City’s
action, which was approved by the court in December 2020.
In February 2021, the City filed a separate but related in rem reverse validation complaint challenging the adoption by Monterey County of a GSP for
the CEMEX site. This complaint remains pending. Currently, both validation actions remain stayed during the pendency of the City’s appeals.
Proposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets — Local Area Formation Commission Litigation
In November 2018, voters in Monterey, California passed “Measure J,” which decided that the MPWMD should conduct a feasibility study concerning
the potential purchase of Cal Am’s Monterey system assets, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of
44

those assets without an additional public vote. This service territory represents approximately 40,000 customers. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses
—Condemnation and Eminent Domain for more information on this matter.
In February 2021, the MPWMD filed an application with LAFCO seeking approval to become a retail water provider and annex approximately 58
parcels of land into the MPWMD’s boundaries. In December 2021, LAFCO’s commissioners denied the MPWMD’s application to become a retail water
provider, determining that the MPWMD does not have the authority to operate the Monterey system assets, a result that precludes the MPWMD from
proceeding with a condemnation thereof. On April 1, 2022, the MPWMD filed a lawsuit against LAFCO challenging its denial. On June 17, 2022, the court
granted, with conditions, a motion by Cal Am to intervene in the MPWMD’s lawsuit against LAFCO. On December 13, 2022, the court sustained in part, and
denied in part, demurrers that had been filed by LAFCO seeking to dismiss the MPWMD’s lawsuit. This matter remains pending.

Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of
the West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by West Virginia-American Water Company, the Company’s West
Virginia subsidiary (“WVAWC”). The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers. In the
early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was
completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by the next morning.
The second repair showed signs of leaking but the water main was usable until June 29, 2015, to allow tanks to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain
service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was being completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully restored on July 1,
2015, to all customers affected by this event.
On June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries, et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha
County on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint
alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and
negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the
class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the
risk of pipe failure and a large outage.
In February 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine the
applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if imposed. In July 2020, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the Jeffries plaintiffs’
motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denying certification of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. In August
2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacate or remand the Circuit Court’s order
certifying the issues class. In January 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of a
decision issued in another case relating to the class certification issues raised on appeal. On July 5, 2022, the Circuit Court entered an order again certifying a
class to address at trial certain liability issues but not to consider damages. On August 26, 2022, WVAWC filed another Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the
Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia challenging the West Virginia Circuit Court’s July 5, 2022 order. The Writ Petition has been supported by an
amicus brief filed by certain water and utility industry trade groups. On February 9, 2023, the Supreme Court of Appeals accepted the Writ Petition by issuing a
Rule to Show Cause and scheduling oral argument for April 26, 2023.
The Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint and WVAWC will
continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations.
Chattanooga, Tennessee Class Action Litigation
On September 12, 2019, Tennessee-American Water Company, the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary (“TAWC”), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water
transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by
early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all customers
on September 16, 2019.

Table of Contents
On September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce, et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was filed in the Circuit Court of Hamilton
County, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and Service Company (collectively, the “Tennessee-American Water Defendants”), on behalf of a proposed
class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered monetary losses as a result of the Chattanooga incident (the “Tennessee Plaintiffs”). The
complaint alleged breach of contract and negligence against the Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the
corporate veil. In the complaint as originally filed, the Tennessee Plaintiffs were seeking an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business
and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages, attorneys’
fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. In September 2020, the court dismissed all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ claims in their complaint, except for the breach
of contract claims against TAWC, which remain pending. In October 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties have been engaging in discovery.
On January 12, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the court issued an oral ruling denying the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On February 9,
2023, the Tennessee Plaintiffs sought reconsideration of the ruling by the court, and any final ruling is appealable to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, as allowed
under Tennessee law.
TAWC and the Company believe that TAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint, and TAWC is vigorously
defending itself against these allegations.
Other Matters
In April 2021, American Water Resources, LLC (“AWR”), which, prior to the December 9, 2021 sale of the Company’s former HOS business was one of
the indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries comprising that business, received a grand jury subpoena in connection with an investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s
Office for the Eastern District of New York (the “EDNY”). The subpoena seeks documents regarding AWR’s operations and its contractor network in the New
York City metropolitan area. On September 9, 2022, a former employee of AWR pled guilty in U.S. District Court to two felony counts in connection with the
matters being investigated by the EDNY. The Company has been fully cooperating with the EDNY investigation and continues to do so, and continues to
believe that the investigation is not focused on the Company.
In connection with the sale of the HOS operations (including all of the Company’s equity interests in AWR), in December 2021, the Company and AWR
entered into an agreement with the buyer of the HOS operations, which facilitates a common defense for, and the sharing of information concerning, the EDNY
investigation and any legal or regulatory inquiries or proceedings related to or resulting from it or the subject matter in the subpoena (collectively, the “Covered
Matters”). The Company, on behalf of AWR, is required to defend any Covered Matter, using commercially reasonable efforts to resolve it on a reasonably
expedient basis. Further, the Company is required to consult with the buyer in specified circumstances and obtain its prior written consent (which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any resolution of any Covered Matter that imposes non-monetary provisions or
undertakings or any other terms for which there will be no indemnification under this agreement. In addition, until March 9, 2025, the Company is required to
indemnify the buyer for any monetary losses or out-of-pocket damages (as described in the agreement) incurred by the buyer or certain of the HOS subsidiaries
to the extent directly arising in connection with, or directly resulting from, any Covered Matter.
While it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of the investigation or determine the amount, if any, of fines, penalties or other liabilities that
may be incurred in connection with it, the Company does not currently believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
General
Periodically, the Company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than those proceedings
described in this Item 3—Legal Proceedings, the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect its financial
position or results of operations. However, litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not
predictable with assurance. It is possible that some litigation and other proceedings could be decided unfavorably to the Company, and that any such
unfavorable decisions could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

ITEM 5.    MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES
Since April 23, 2008, the Company’s common stock has traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “AWK.” As of
January 31, 2023, there were 181,858,619 shares of common stock outstanding held by approximately 2,234 record holders. Holders of the Company’s
common stock are entitled to receive dividends when they are declared by its Board of Directors. See Note 9—Shareholders’ Equity in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s dividends.
In February 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued through the
Company’s dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. The program allows the Company to purchase up to 10
million shares of its outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The
program is conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and, to facilitate these repurchases, the Company enters into Rule 10b5-1 stock
repurchase plans with a third-party broker, which allow the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented
from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Subject to applicable regulations, the Company may elect to
amend or cancel the program or the stock repurchase parameters at its discretion to manage dilution.
From April 1, 2015, the date repurchases under the anti-dilutive stock repurchase program commenced, through December 31, 2022, the Company
repurchased an aggregate of 4,860,000 shares of its common stock under the program, leaving an aggregate of 5,140,000 shares available for repurchase under
this program. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2022.

Financial Results
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, diluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $4.51, $6.95 and $3.91, respectively. The 2021
financial results included a pre-tax gain of $748 million relating to the sale of HOS and a $45 million pre-tax contribution to the American Water Charitable
Foundation, a consolidated net impact of $2.70 diluted earnings per share. After excluding the gain related to the sale of HOS and charitable contribution in
2021, diluted earnings per share increased $0.26 in 2022 as compared to 2021. This increase was primarily driven by continued growth in the Regulated
Businesses from infrastructure investment and acquisitions, as well as organic growth, offset somewhat by impacts from inflationary pressures on production
costs and higher interest costs along with higher depreciation expenses from the growth of the business. Results for 2022 also reflect the favorable impact of
weather, estimated at $0.06 per share, primarily due to hot and dry weather in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to a $0.02 per share favorable impact in
2021. Also, included in the results for 2022 are $0.24 per share from interest income earned on the seller note and income earned on revenue share agreements,
which compares to HOS operating results for 2021 of $0.31 per share. Lastly, the operating results for the Company’s New York subsidiary, which was sold on
January 1, 2022, were $0.12 per share in 2021. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.
Growth Through Capital Investment in Infrastructure and Regulated Acquisitions
The Company continues to grow its businesses, with the majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses through (i) continued capital
investment in the Company’s infrastructure to provide safe, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, and (ii) regulated
acquisitions to expand the Company’s services to new customers. In 2022, the Company invested $2.6 billion, primarily in the Regulated Businesses, as
discussed below:
Regulated Businesses Growth and Optimization
• $2.3 billion capital investment in the Regulated Businesses, the substantial majority for infrastructure improvements and replacements; and
• $315 million to fund acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, which added approximately 70,000 customers during 2022, in addition to
approximately 18,500 customers added through organic growth during 2022. This includes the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary’s acquisition
of the wastewater system assets from the York City Sewer Authority and the City of York on May 27, 2022, for a cash purchase price of $235
million, $20 million of which was funded as a deposit to the seller in April 2021 in connection with the execution of the acquisition agreement.
On October 11, 2022, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the wastewater assets of the Butler Area Sewer
Authority for a total purchase price of $232 million in cash, subject to adjustment as provided for in the Asset Purchase Agreement. This system provides
wastewater service for approximately 14,700 customer connections. The Company expects to close this acquisition by the end of 2023, pending regulatory
approval.
On March 29, 2021, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City for
$22 million. The water and wastewater systems currently serve approximately 1,500 customers each, or 3,000 combined, and are being sold through the New
Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act process. The Company expects to close this acquisition in early 2023.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has entered into agreements for 21 pending acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, including the two
agreements discussed above, to add approximately 32,400 additional customers.
Sale of Homeowner Services Group
On December 9, 2021, the Company sold all of the equity interests in subsidiaries that comprised the Company’s HOS to a wholly owned subsidiary of
funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, a global private equity advisory firm (the “Buyer”), for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion, resulting in
pre-tax gain of $748 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. The consideration was comprised of $480 million in cash, a seller promissory note issued by the
Buyer in the principal amount of $720 million, and a contingent cash payment of $75 million payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before
December 31, 2023. See Note 18—Fair Value of Financial Information for additional information relating to the seller promissory note and contingent cash
payment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded post-close adjustments, primarily related to working capital, of pre-tax income of $20
million, which is included in Gain on sale of businesses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The seller note has a five-year term, is payable in cash, and bears interest at a rate of 7.00% per year during the term. The Company recognized $50
million of interest income during the year ended December 31, 2022, from the seller note.

Table of Contents
The Company and the Buyer also entered into revenue share agreements, pursuant to which the Company is to receive 10% of the revenue generated
from customers who are billed for home warranty services through an applicable Company subsidiary (an “on-bill” arrangement), and 15% of the revenue
generated from any future on-bill arrangements entered into after the closing. Unless earlier terminated, this agreement has a term of up to 15 years, which may
be renewed for up to two five-year periods. The Company recognized $9 million of income during the year ended December 31, 2022, from the revenue share
agreements, which is included in Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc.
On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the previously disclosed sale of its regulated utility operations in New York to Liberty Utilities (Eastern
Water Holdings) Corp. (“Liberty”), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Liberty purchased from the Company all of the
capital stock of the Company’s New York subsidiary for a purchase price of $608 million in cash. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Sale of Michigan American Water Company
On February 4, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its operations in Michigan for $6 million in cash.
Future Growth
The Company expects to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion over the next five years, and between $30 billion to $34 billion over the next 10 years,
including $2.9 billion in 2023. The Company’s expected future investments include:
• capital investment for infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses between $12.5 billion to $13 billion over the next five years, and
between $27 billion to $30 billion over the next 10 years, including $2.5 billion expected in 2023; and
• growth from acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses to expand the Company’s water and wastewater customer base of between $1.5 billion to
$2 billion over the next five years, and between $3 billion to $4 billion over the next 10 years, including $400 million expected in 2023.
Presented in the following chart is the estimated allocation of the Company’s expected capital investment for infrastructure improvements in its
Regulated Businesses over the next five years, by purpose:

Other Matters
Military Services Group
On June 30, 2022, MSG was awarded a contract for the ownership, operation, maintenance and replacement of the wastewater utility system assets at
Naval Station Mayport in Jacksonville, Florida. The contract was effective July 1, 2022, and its total revenue is approximately $341 million over a 50-year
period, subject to an annual economic price adjustment. The performance start date for operation is scheduled for March 1, 2023. MSG operates and maintains
water and/or wastewater systems and related capital programs as part of the U.S. government’s Utilities Privatization Program. This contract represents the
18th installation in MSG’s footprint and the first contract with respect to a U.S. Navy installation.
Permanganate Supply Disruption
In January 2023, a fire occurred at a plant owned by the sole supplier of permanganate in the Western Hemisphere, which has severely limited the U.S.
supply of potassium and sodium permanganate, two chemicals used by water utilities to treat water. The Company is seeking to utilize alternative methods of
treatment and to manage its existing supplies of permanganate, but any inability to source sufficient quantities of these chemicals or utilize alternative
chemicals may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to comply with applicable environmental and regulatory requirements.
Operational Excellence
The Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio was 33.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 34.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The ratio reflects an increase in operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses, after considering the adjustment for the amortization of
the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”) shown in the table below, as well as the continued focus on operating costs.
The Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as its operation and maintenance
expenses from the Regulated Businesses, divided by the operating revenues from the Regulated Businesses, where both operation and maintenance expenses
and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. Operating revenues were further adjusted to exclude reductions for the
amortization of the EADIT. Also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses is the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly
depreciation and general taxes, which is reflected in the Regulated Businesses segment as operation and maintenance expenses, but for consolidated financial
reporting purposes, is categorized within other line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The items discussed above were
excluded from the O&M efficiency ratio calculation as they are not reflective of management’s ability to increase the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses.
The Company evaluates its operating performance using this ratio, and believes it is useful to investors because it directly measures improvement in the
operating performance and efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. This information is derived from the Company’s consolidated financial information but is
not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the
Company’s GAAP disclosures, and should be considered as an addition to, and not a substitute for, any GAAP measure. The Company’s adjusted regulated
O&M efficiency ratio (i) is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP; (ii) is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of
calculation; (iii) may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures; and (iv) should not be used in place of the GAAP information provided
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On December 15, 2022, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on
February 10, 2022, by the Company’s Illinois subsidiary. As updated in the Illinois subsidiary’s June 29, 2022 rebuttal filing, the request sought $83 million in
additional annualized revenues excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges. The general rate case order approved a $67 million annualized
increase in water and wastewater system revenues excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges, effective January 1, 2023, based on an authorized
return on equity of 9.8%, authorized rate base of $1.64 billion, a common equity ratio of 49.0% and a debt ratio of 51.0%. The annualized revenue increase is
being driven primarily by significant water and wastewater system capital investments since the Illinois subsidiary’s 2017 rate case order that have been
completed or are planned through December 31, 2023, expected higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and increases in production costs,
including chemicals, fuel and power costs.
On December 8, 2022, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving the joint settlement of the rate case filed on April 29,
2022, by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $138 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues
and authorizes implementation of the new water and wastewater rates effective January 28, 2023. The rate case proceeding was resolved through a “black box”
settlement agreement and did not specify an approved return on equity (“ROE”). The annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by significant incremental
capital investments since the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s 2021 rate case order that will be completed through December 31, 2023, increases in pension and other
postretirement benefits expense and increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order also includes recovery
of the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary’s COVID-19 deferral balance.
On August 17, 2022, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary was authorized additional annual revenues of $46 million in its general rate case, effective
September 1, 2022, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.6%, authorized rate base of $4.15 billion, a common equity ratio of 54.6% and a long-term
debt ratio of 45.4%. The request incorporated updated estimates of production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
Company’s New Jersey subsidiary will defer as a regulatory asset or liability, as appropriate, the difference between its pension expense and other
postretirement benefits expense and those amounts included in base rates. The deferral period for this regulatory asset or liability will be two years or, if earlier,
will end at the conclusion of the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary’s next general rate case. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary also withdrew its request,
without prejudice, to recover its existing authorized COVID-19-related regulatory asset in the general rate case and will seek recovery in a separate proceeding
within the process established in the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities’ (the “NJBPU”) generic COVID-19-related proceeding.

On February 24, 2022, WVAWC was authorized additional annual revenues of $13 million in its general rate case, effective February 25, 2022, based on
an authorized return on equity of 9.8%, authorized rate base of $734 million and a common equity ratio of 47.9%. Staff of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia moved for reconsideration of the final order on several grounds. WVAWC filed its response to the Staff's Petition for Reconsideration on March
28, 2022, in support of the authorized revenue requirement. On October 21, 2022, the Public Service Commission of West Virginia denied the motion for
reconsideration.
Pending General Rate Case Filings
On July 1, 2022, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting an increase in 2024 revenue of $56 million and a total increase
in revenue over the 2024 to 2026 period of $95 million, with all increases compared against 2022 revenues. The Company updated its filing in January 2023 to
capture the authorized step increase effective January 1, 2023. The filing was also updated to incorporate a decoupling proposal and a revision to the
Company’s sales and associated variable expense forecast. The revised requested additional annualized revenues for the test year 2024 is now $37 million,
compared against 2023 revenues. This excludes the proposed step rate and attrition rate increase for 2025 and 2026 of $20 million and $19 million,
respectively. The total revenue requirement request for the three-year rate case cycle, incorporating updates to present rate revenues and forecasted demand, is
$76 million.
On July 1, 2022, the Company’s Missouri subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $105 million in additional annualized revenues.
On November 15, 2021, the Company’s Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $14 million in additional annualized revenues. Interim
rates were effective on May 1, 2022, and the difference between interim and final approved rates is subject to refund. On September 26, 2022, a settlement
agreement, supported by all parties except one, was filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for a $11 million annual revenue increase. Public
hearings were held on September 27 and 28, 2022. A final decision on this matter is expected in the first quarter of 2023.
The Company’s California subsidiary submitted its application on May 3, 2021, to set its cost of capital for 2022 through 2024. According to the
CPUC’s procedural schedule, a decision setting the authorized cost of capital is expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2023.
Infrastructure Surcharges
A number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and
investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table

Other Regulatory Matters
In September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that required the Company’s
California subsidiary to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would become
effective in January 2024. On October 5, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the decision and following the
CPUC’s denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review with the California
Supreme Court on October 27, 2021. On May 18, 2022, the California Supreme Court issued a writ of review for the Company’s California subsidiary’s
petition and the petitions filed by other entities challenging the decision. Independent of the judicial challenge, California passed Senate Bill 1469, which
allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporation’s revenue and its water sales. Legislation
was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022, and became effective on January 1, 2023. In response to the legislation, on January 27, 2023, the
Company’s California subsidiary filed an updated application requesting the CPUC to consider a Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism in
its pending 2022 general rate case, which would be effective 2024 through 2026.
On March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the NJBPU that
recommended denial of a petition filed by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million
associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfield’s water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July
29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJ’s initial decision without modification. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal
with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed its brief in support of the appeal on March 4,
2022. Response and Reply briefs were filed on June 22, 2022, and August 4, 2022, respectively. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the
NJBPU’s order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Segment Results of Operations
The Company’s operating segments are comprised of its businesses which generate revenue, incur expense and have separate financial information
which is regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its business primarily
through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. Other primarily includes MSG, which does not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in
accordance with GAAP. Other also includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment, interest income related to the seller
promissory note and income from the revenue share agreement from the sale of HOS, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments
related to acquisitions that have not been allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment. This presentation is consistent with how management assesses the
results of these businesses. For a discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial statements for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, please refer to Item 7
—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2022.
As a result of the sale of HOS, the categories which were previously shown as “Market-Based Businesses” and “Other” have been combined and shown
as Other. Segment results for the year ended December 31, 2021, have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change.

Included in operating revenues for 2021, was $127 million related to the Company’s New York operations. Excluding the Company’s New York
operations, for 2022, operating revenues increased $248 million, primarily due to: (i) a $180 million increase from authorized rate increases, including
infrastructure surcharges, principally to fund infrastructure investment in various states; (ii) a $36 million increase from water and wastewater acquisitions, as
well as organic growth in existing systems; (iii) a $17 million net increase as a result of reduced amortization of EADIT, primarily in the Company’s New
Jersey subsidiary; and (iv) a $13 million estimated net increase primarily due to warmer and drier than normal weather in the third quarter of 2022 in the
Company’s New Jersey and Missouri service territories, which was partially offset by warmer and drier than normal weather in the second quarter of 2021 in
the Northeast.

operations, for 2022, employee-related costs remained consistent compared to 2021. In 2022, the Regulated Businesses experienced an increase in salaries and
wages due to merit increases and higher headcount to support growth, which was offset by higher capitalized labor and overhead rates, as well as lower pension
service costs.

Included in production costs for 2021, was $8 million related to the Company’s New York operations. Excluding the Company’s New York operations,
for 2022, production costs increased $42 million, primarily due to inflationary pressures which resulted in increased fuel, power and chemical costs.
Customer Billing and Accounting
In 2022, as compared to 2021, customer billing and accounting decreased $7 million primarily due to the sale of the Company’s New York operations
and lower uncollectible customer accounts expense.
Other
In 2022, as compared to 2021, other increased $10 million primarily due to increase to the insurance other than group reserve which had an unfavorable
claims experience compared to prior year.
Depreciation and Amortization
In 2022, as compared to 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $32 million primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service from capital
infrastructure investments and acquisitions.
General Taxes
In 2022, as compared to 2021, general taxes decreased $37 million, primarily related to the sale of the Company’s New York operations.
Other Income (Expense)
In 2022, as compared to 2021, other expenses increased $25 million primarily due to higher interest expense as a result of an $800 million long-term
debt issuance in May 2022 and higher interest rates on short-term debt due to macroeconomic market conditions.
Provision for Income Taxes
In 2022, as compared to 2021, the Regulated Businesses’ provision for income taxes increased $16 million. The Regulated Businesses’ effective income
tax rate was 18.0% and 17.9% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the decrease in the
amortization of EADIT due to the completion of stub period amortization, pursuant to regulatory orders. The amortization of EADIT is generally offset with
reductions in revenue.

Gain on Sale of Businesses
During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $748 million relating to the sale of HOS. In 2022, the Company recorded
post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital, of pre-tax income of $20 million, which increased the total gain related to the sale of HOS. See
Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Provision for Income Taxes
In 2022, as compared to 2021, provision for income taxes decreased $205 million primarily due to the sale of HOS. See Note 5—Acquisitions and
Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Tax Matters
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). The IRA contains a Corporate Alternative
Minimum Tax (“CAMT”) provision, effective January 1, 2023. To determine if a company is considered an applicable corporation subject to CAMT, the
company’s average adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) for the three consecutive years preceding the tax year must exceed $1 billion. An applicable
corporation must make several adjustments to AFSI when determining CAMT under the new law. Initial guidance regarding the application of the CAMT was
issued on December 27, 2022, and additional guidance is forthcoming. The Company is continuing to assess the impact of the initial guidance and will
continue to monitor as additional guidance is released.
On July 8, 2022, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law Act 53 of 2022, which reduces the Pennsylvania State Income Tax Rate in yearly
increments starting January 1, 2023, with an initial rate of 8.99% and ending effective January 1, 2031, with a rate of 4.99%. Under Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC
740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or
settled. As such, the Company’s accumulated deferred income tax (“ADIT”) balances for its Pennsylvania subsidiary were remeasured during the quarter ended
September 30, 2022, to estimate the impacts of the recently enacted tax rate. The remeasurement reduced the ADIT liability by $159 million as of December
31, 2022 and created a corresponding regulatory liability since the EADIT is expected to be returned to customers in a future rate case. However, since the rate
is declining in yearly increments, the total EADIT will be subject to change.
On September 27, 2022, Iowa’s Department of Revenue announced a reduction in the state’s top corporate rate from 9.8% to 8.4% effective January 1,
2023. As such, the Company’s ADIT balances for its Iowa subsidiary were remeasured during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, to estimate the impacts of
the recently enacted tax rate. The remeasurement reduced the ADIT liability by $2 million as of December 31, 2022 and created a corresponding regulatory
liability since the EADIT is expected to be returned to customers in a future rate case.
Federal Net Operating Loss
The Company had no federal NOL carryover balance as of December 31, 2021.
Legislative Updates
During 2022, the Company’s regulatory jurisdictions enacted the following legislation that has been approved and is effective as of February 15, 2023:
• Indiana passed Senate Enrolled Act 272, which requires public reporting of a non-jurisdictional utility’s asset management programs. Non-
jurisdictional utilities are exempt from the jurisdiction of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the “IURC”). The legislation also creates a
water and wastewater research and extension program at a state university to serve as a repository for data collected from utilities. Additionally,
the legislation establishes oversight and a receivership program in the IURC for non-jurisdictional utilities with violations that create
environmental or human health and safety issues. Legislation was signed by the Governor on March 7, 2022, and became effective on July 1,
2022.
• Indiana passed water and wastewater utility asset financing legislation, Senate Enrolled Act 273, which authorizes the recovery of property tax in
Distribution System Improvement Charge filings. The legislation also permits the IURC to allow recovery through tracking mechanisms for
changes in property tax and for costs attributable to referenda or action by elected or appointed individuals. Legislation was signed by the
Governor on March 10, 2022, and became effective on July 1, 2022.

Table of Contents
• Virginia passed Senate Bill 500 and House Bill 182, which requires the Virginia State Corporation Commission, in any future ratemaking
proceeding for an investor-owned water/wastewater utility, to evaluate the utility on a stand-alone basis and utilize the utility’s actual end-of-test
period capital structure and cost of capital without regard to the cost of capital, capital structure, or investments of any other entities with which
the utility may be affiliated. Legislation was signed by the Governor on April 11, 2022, and became effective on July 1, 2022.
• Illinois passed House Bill 900/Public Act 102-0698, which contains appropriations to the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity of
$3 million for the purposes of the Water and Sewer Finance Assistance Act (H.B. 414/Public Act 102-0262) and $55 million for the purposes of
the federal Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP). Legislation was signed by the Governor on April 19, 2022, with these
provisions of the bill taking effect on July 1, 2022.
• Tennessee passed Senate Bill 2282 and House Bill 2346, which requires all utilities to implement a cyber security plan and update it every two
years to provide for the protection of the utility’s facilities from unauthorized use, alteration, ransom, or destruction of electronic data. The
relevant regulatory body will verify if a utility has complied or impose reasonable sanctions if out of compliance. Utility compliance will be
required by July 1, 2023. Legislation was signed by the Governor on June 1, 2022, and became effective immediately.
• The Missouri General Assembly passed state and local property tax tracker legislation, Senate Bill 745, which requires a utility to defer to a
regulatory asset or liability account any difference in what was actually paid in state or local property taxes and what was used to set the revenue
requirement in the utility’s most recently completed general rate case. Legislation was signed by the Governor on June 29, 2022, and became
effective on August 28, 2022.
• California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water
corporation’s revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022 and became effective on January 1,
2023.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company uses its capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt
maturities, (iii) pay dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) to pay federal income taxes. The
Company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a long-term return on investment. Additionally, the
Company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes
place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Regulation
and Rate Making for additional information. The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to
the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows
from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next
five years through a combination of long-term debt and equity in addition to the remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS. The remaining proceeds from the
sale of HOS include receipt of a seller promissory note, plus interest, and a contingent cash payment payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or
before December 31, 2023. If necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other
sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum
required capital investments for an extended period of time.
The Company regularly evaluates and monitors its cash requirements for capital investments, acquisitions, operations, commitments, debt maturities,
interest and dividends. The Company’s business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. The Company also
obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings, and may also access the equity capital
markets as needed or desired to support capital funding requirements. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”),
the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. The Company’s access to
external financing on reasonable terms may depend on, as appropriate, any or all of the following: current business conditions, including that of the utility and
water utility industry in general; conditions in the debt or equity capital markets; the Company’s credit ratings; and conditions in the national and international
economic and geopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new
commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the Company’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets.

Table of Contents
If these unfavorable business, market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Company is no longer able to access the
commercial paper and/or capital markets on reasonable terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility. AWCC’s revolving credit facility is
used principally to support its commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support, and to provide a sublimit for the issuance of up to $150
million in letters of credit. On October 26, 2022, AWCC and certain lenders amended and restated the credit agreement with respect to the revolving credit
facility to, among other things, increase the maximum commitments under the facility from $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion and to extend the expiration date of
the facility from March 2025 to October 2027. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum
commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500 million and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two one-year periods. Also,
effective October 26, 2022, the maximum aggregate principal amount of short-term borrowings authorized under AWCC’s commercial paper program was
increased from $2.10 billion to $2.60 billion. As of December 31, 2022, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $78 million of outstanding letters of credit
under its revolving credit facility, with $1.50 billion available to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit.
The Company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will
generate sufficient cash to fund the Company’s short-term requirements. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its
expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, there can be no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing
commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCC will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on
acceptable terms or at all.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are generally
greater during the warmer months. The Company’s future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by, among other things: customers’ ability to pay
for service in a timely manner, economic utility regulation, inflation, compliance with environmental, health and safety standards, production costs,
maintenance costs, customer growth, declining customer usage of water, employee-related costs, including pension funding, weather and seasonality, taxes, and
overall economic conditions.
Operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the Company’s rate regulated environments, changes in the economy, interest rates, the
timing of tax payments, and the Company’s customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner, among other items. The Company can provide no
assurance that its customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future. The Company’s current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from
debt maturities due within one year and the use of short-term debt as a funding source, primarily to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, fund
acquisitions and construction projects, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business and other factors. The
Company addresses cash timing differences primarily through its short-term liquidity funding mechanisms.
Presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Company’s cash flows from operating activities:

(c) The decrease in the 2022 deferred tax activity is primarily due to the settlement of the deferred tax liability related to New York American Water, sold in January 2022.
63
Table of Contents
In 2022, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $333 million. The changes were driven by $338 million of estimated tax payments
primarily for taxable gains on the sales of the Company’s HOS business and its New York regulated operations, as well as the contribution of $45 million to the
American Water Charitable Foundation. Partially offsetting these changes was a decrease due to the gain recognized from the sale of HOS in 2021.
The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $39 million in 2023. Actual amounts contributed could change materially from
this estimate as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Company’s cash flows from investing activities:

Removal costs from property, plant and equipment retirements, net (123) (109) (106)
Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,127) $ (1,536) $ (2,061)
In 2022, cash flows used in investing activities increased $591 million primarily due to increased payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions
partially offset by proceeds of $608 million received from the sale of the Company’s New York operations. The Company continues to invest across all
infrastructure categories, mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution and services, meter and fire hydrants infrastructure in the
Company’s Regulated Businesses, as discussed below.
The Company’s infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where the Company replaces mains, services, meters,
hydrants and valves, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where the Company constructs new water and wastewater treatment and delivery
facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations. The Company’s projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to
periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.
Presented in the table below is a summary of the Company’s capital expenditures by category:
 For the Years Ended December 31,

Wastewater 185 137 126 
Total capital expenditures $ 2,297 $ 1,764 $ 1,822 
In 2022, the Company’s capital expenditures increased $533 million due to an increase across most infrastructure categories.
The Company also grows its business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems. These acquisitions are generally located in
geographic proximity to the Company’s existing Regulated Businesses and support continued geographical diversification and growth of its operations.
Generally, acquisitions are funded initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with long-term financing. During 2022, the Company paid $315 million
for the acquisition of 26 water and wastewater systems, representing in the aggregate approximately 70,000 customers.
As previously noted, over the next five years the Company expects to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion, with $12.5 billion to $13 billion for
infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses, and the Company expects to invest between $30 billion to $34 billion over the next 10 years. In
2023, the Company expects to invest $2.9 billion, consisting of $2.5 billion for infrastructure improvements and $400 million for acquisitions in the Regulated
Businesses.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Company’s cash flows from financing activities:
For the Years Ended December 31,

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 1,000 $ (345) $ 1,120 
(a) Includes proceeds from issuances of common stock under various employee stock plans and the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan, net of taxes paid, advances and contributions in aid of
construction, net of refunds, and debt issuance costs and make-whole premiums on early debt redemption.
In 2022, cash flows provided by financing activities increased $1,345 million, primarily due to an increase in commercial paper borrowings, the
repayment in full at maturity of the $500 million term loan in 2021 and repayments of long-term debt due to the prepayment of $327 million in aggregate
principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding senior notes in 2021, with no comparable repayments in 2022. These changes were partially offset by lower proceeds
from long-term debt.
The Company’s financing activities are primarily focused on funding regulated infrastructure expenditures, regulated acquisitions and payment of
dividends. These activities included the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through AWCC. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses
and the Company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings to the
Regulated Businesses and parent company. The Regulated Businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and
interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. Parent company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for
the Regulated Businesses, therefore, parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates. As of
December 31, 2022, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the Regulated Businesses amounting to $7.6 billion.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to parent company amounting to $3.6 billion.
On May 5, 2022, AWCC issued $800 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.45% senior notes due 2032. At closing, AWCC received, after
deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $792 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of
the offering: (i) to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations; and (iii) for general
corporate purposes.
One of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows
risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as treasury lock agreements. The Company also reduces exposure to
interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts (through AWCC) for speculative
purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The
Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the
counterparty credit risk on these transactions by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.
In April 2022, the Company entered into several 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $400 million, and an average fixed
interest rate of 2.89%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive gain or loss. In May 2022, the Company terminated the treasury lock agreements, realizing a net gain of approximately $4 million, to be
amortized through interest, net over a 10-year period, in accordance with the tenor of the debt issuance on May 5, 2022.
65
Table of Contents
In November and December 2022, the Company entered into four 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $100 million, to
reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2023. These treasury lock agreements terminate in January 2024, and have an average fixed rate
of 3.56%. In January 2023, the Company entered into three additional 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $100 million, to reduce
interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2023. These treasury lock agreements terminate in January 2024, and have an average fixed rate of
3.35%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain
or loss. Upon termination, the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net over
the term of the new debt.
No ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.
In February 2021, parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables the Company to meet its capital
needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities, including American Water common
stock, preferred stock, and other equity and hybrid securities, and AWCC debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic
conditions, and as applicable, rating status. The shelf registration statement will expire in February 2024. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, $800 million, $1.10
billion, and $1.00 billion, respectively, of debt securities were issued under this and predecessor registration statements.

Issuer and Guarantor of Senior Notes
The outstanding senior notes issued by AWCC have been issued under two indentures, each by and between AWCC and Computershare Trust Company,
N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the
notes issued thereunder. The senior notes also have been issued with the benefit of a support agreement, as amended, between parent company and AWCC,
which serves as the functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s payment obligations under the senior notes. No
other subsidiary of parent company provides guarantees for any of the outstanding senior notes. If AWCC is unable to make timely payment of any interest,
principal or premium, if any, on such senior notes, parent company will provide to AWCC, at its request or the request of any holder of such senior notes, funds
to make such payment in full. If AWCC fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce certain rights under the support agreement or if AWCC defaults in the
timely payment of any amounts owed to any holder of such senior notes, when due, the support agreement provides that the holder may proceed directly
against parent company to enforce such rights or to obtain payment of the defaulted amounts owed to that holder.
As a wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, AWCC has no significant assets other than obligations of parent company and certain of its
subsidiaries in its Regulated Businesses segment to repay certain intercompany loans made to them by AWCC. AWCC’s ability to make payments of amounts
owed to holders of the senior notes will be dependent upon AWCC’s receipt of sufficient payments of amounts owed pursuant to the terms of such
intercompany loans and from its ability to issue indebtedness or otherwise obtain loans in the future, the proceeds of which would be used to fund the
repayment of the senior notes.
Because parent company is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries other than AWCC, parent
company’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the support agreement will be dependent upon its receipt of sufficient cash dividends or distributions from its
operating subsidiaries. See Note 9—Shareholders’ Equity—Dividends and Distributions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary
of the limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions. Furthermore, parent company’s operating subsidiaries are
separate and distinct legal entities and, other than AWCC, have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or to make available or provide any
funds for such payment, other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans, if any, with AWCC. Based on the foregoing, parent
company’s obligations under the support agreement will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, lease
commitments and moneys borrowed or other indebtedness incurred or issued by parent company’s subsidiaries other than AWCC.
Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt
Interest rates on advances under the Company’s revolving credit facility are based on a credit spread to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)
rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate, each determined in accordance with Moody Investors Service’s and S&P Global Ratings’ then
applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program
and to provide up to $150 million in letters of credit. Indebtedness under the facility and AWCC’s commercial paper are considered “debt” for purposes of a
support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of
AWCC’s payment obligations thereunder.
Presented in the tables below are the aggregate credit facility commitments, commercial paper limit and letter of credit availability under the revolving
credit facility, as well as the available capacity for each, as of December 31:

The weighted average interest rate on AWCC’s outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 4.41% and 0.20%, for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Capital Structure
Presented in the table below is the percentage of the Company’s capitalization represented by the components of its capital structure as of December 31:

Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt 7.3 % 3.5 % 9.3 %
Total 100 % 100 % 100 %
The changes in the capital structure mix between periods were mainly attributable to the impacts of the HOS sale on December 9, 2021, and the
repayment of short-term borrowings with proceeds from the sale, and the Company’s long-term debt offering that was completed on May 5, 2022.
Debt Covenants
The Company’s debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these
covenants, an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the Company, or its subsidiaries, may be restricted in its ability to pay
dividends, issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things,
prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt secured by the Company’s assets, subject to certain exceptions. Failure to comply with any of these
covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.
Covenants in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated
capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2022, the Company’s ratio was 0.62 to 1.00 and therefore
the Company was in compliance with the covenants.

Senior unsecured debt Baa1 A
Commercial paper P-2 A-1
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating
agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in
an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to
maintain its existing ratings. None of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings,
although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility.
As part of its normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, power and other fuel, chemicals
and other services. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of
future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is
downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely
on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must
provide collateral to secure its obligations. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the
Company’s securities ratings. The Company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, the
Company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of mortgage bonds and tax exempt securities or borrowings under state
revolving funds, to lower the overall cost of debt.
Dividends and Regulatory Restrictions
For discussion of the Company’s dividends, dividend restrictions and dividend policy, see Note 9—Shareholders’ Equity in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.
Insurance Coverage
The Company carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are
consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. Additionally, annual
policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. The Company is self-
insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s short-term and long-term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions
and judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates,
assumptions and judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in
making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates,
assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows, as reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with
the Company’s Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. Additional discussion
regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Regulation and Regulatory Accounting
The Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs and, as such, the Company follows the authoritative accounting principles required
for rate regulated utilities, which requires the Company to reflect the effects of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of this authoritative
guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable
assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As of December 31, 2022, the
Company concluded that the operations of its utilities met the criteria.
Application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. The Company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such
judgments include, but are not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and
taxes. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged
as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the
principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected
in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.
For each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the
regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement.
This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a
specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. If subsequent events
indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the Company’s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and financial position could be materially affected. In addition, if the Company concludes in a future period that a
separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria, the Company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of
the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s regulatory asset balance was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and its regulatory liability
balance was $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. See Note 3—Regulatory Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information regarding the Company’s significant regulatory assets and liabilities.
Accounting for Income Taxes
Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions
taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of NOL carryforwards.
In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a
two-step approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is
greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its
technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met
the recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the
position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the
recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and
ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including
those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Company records valuation allowances
for deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.
Under GAAP, specifically ASC 740, Income Taxes, the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted.
ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized
or settled. For the Company’s regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability and
may be subject to refund to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement
adjustment to earnings.

Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the
Company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the
regulatory process for the Regulated Businesses, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. The resulting tax
balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance; however, the ultimate
outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material.
See Note 14—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.
Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits
The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations.
The Company also maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. See Note 2—Significant Accounting
Policies and Note 15—Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the description of and
accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.
The Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions
provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s
pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are
selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and
the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary
assumptions are:
• Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be
made in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a
portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.
• Expected Return on Plan Assets (“EROA”)—Management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily
based upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net
benefit costs the Company records currently.
• Rate of Compensation Increase—Management projects employees’ pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at
retirement.
• Health Care Cost Trend Rate—Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.
• Mortality— Management adopted the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 mortality base table, the most recent table developed from private pension
plan experience, which provides rates of mortality in 2012 and adopted the new MP-2021 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future
mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2012.
The discount rate assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year,
consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of
settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of
individually selected bonds. For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot
rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. The weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining pension benefit obligations was 5.58%,
2.94% and 2.74% at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining other postretirement
benefit obligations was 5.60%, 2.90% and 2.56% at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
In selecting an EROA, the Company considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the
plans. The weighted-average EROA assumption used in calculating pension cost was 6.50% for 2022, 6.50% for 2021, and 6.50% for 2020. The weighted-
average EROA assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 3.60% for 2022, 3.67% for 2021 and 3.68% for 2020.

(a) Refer to Note 15—Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the allocations of assets and the trusts which fund the other postretirement
benefit plans
The investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through mutual funds,
commingled funds and limited partnerships. The trustee for the Company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent
valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets.
In selecting a rate of compensation increase, the Company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. The Company’s rate of
compensation increase was 3.51% for 2022, 3.51% for 2021 and 3.51% for 2020.
In selecting health care cost trend rates, the Company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2022,
the Company’s health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic benefit cost was 6.00% in 2022 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and
thereafter. As of December 31, 2022, the Company projects that medical inflation will be 7.00% in 2023 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2031 and thereafter.
The Company will use a weighted-average discount rate and EROA of 5.58% and 6.75%, respectively, for estimating its 2023 pension costs.
Additionally, the Company will use a weighted-average discount rate and EROA of 5.60% and 5.00%, respectively, for estimating its 2023 other postretirement
benefit costs. A decrease in the discount rate or the EROA would increase the Company’s pension expense. The Company’s 2022 pension and postretirement
total net benefit credit was $47 million and the 2021 pension and postretirement total net benefit credit was $41 million. The Company expects to make pension
contributions to the plan trusts of $39 million in 2023; however, the actual amounts contributed could change materially from this estimate. The assumptions
are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and
postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards.
Benefit Plan Amendments
In December 2022, the Company amended the American Water Pension Plan (“AWPP”), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, to restructure it as
of December 31, 2022. The restructuring involved the spin-off of certain inactive participants from the existing AWPP into a separate tax-qualified defined
benefit pension plan, the American Water Pension Plan for Certain Inactive Participants (“AWPP Inactive”). Benefits offered to the plan participants remain
unchanged. Actuarial gains and losses associated with AWPP Inactive will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants,
which increases the amortization period from approximately 7 years to 18 years. The longer amortization period is expected to lower the Company’s pre-tax
pension expense by approximately $5 million in 2023. The actuarial gains and losses associated with the AWPP will continue to be amortized over the average
remaining service period for active participants. The Company remeasured the pension plan obligation and assets for each plan as of December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents
Upon evaluating prior plan changes, Company funding and market performance, in December 2022, the Company completed plan amendments to spin-
off and merge a portion of the American Water Retiree Welfare Plan, with and into the Company’s medical plan for active employees (“Active Medical Plan”),
in order to repurpose the over-funded portion of the Bargained Retiree Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“Bargained VEBA”) trust. Benefits
offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. As a result of these changes, effective December 31, 2022, the Company transferred investment assets from
the Bargained VEBA into the existing trust maintained for the benefit of Active Medical Plan participants (“Active VEBA”). The transfer of these Bargained
VEBA investment assets into the Active VEBA permits access to approximately $194 million of assets for purposes of paying active union employee medical
benefits. The Company recorded the transfer of assets as a negative contribution and therefore did not record a gain or loss, as permitted by accounting
guidance. See Note 18—Fair Value of Financial Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on accounting for
the assets as investments in debt and equity securities as of December 31, 2022.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts
contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately
identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. Revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are
generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amounts
calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The
amounts that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to
the value transferred to the customer.
Increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be
significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers
scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $178 million and $162 million, respectively.
The Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to
customers will occur through the ratemaking process.
Revenue from the Company’s former HOS business, which was sold in December 2021, was generated through various protection programs in which
the Company provided fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior
electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, power surge protection and other related services. Most of the contracts had a one-year term
and each service was a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided
from the service. Customers were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized
ratably over time for those services. Advances from customers were deferred until the performance obligation was satisfied.
The Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military
installations and facilities owned by municipal customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the
contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make
capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-
alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance
obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during
the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are
recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract
performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are
determined. Unbilled revenue within Other as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $97 million and $86 million, respectively.

Table of Contents
Accounting for Contingencies
The Company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount
of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about
the likely outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause
these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not
limited to: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience
gained from similar cases or situations. The Company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable
possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred. The Company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be
reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonable range.
Actual amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have
a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 16—Commitments and
Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies.
Recent Accounting Standards
See Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting standards.
ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. The Company is exposed to risks
from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. The Company manages its interest rate exposure
by limiting its variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The Company also has the ability to enter into financial
derivative instruments, which could include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and U.S. Treasury lock
agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1% associated with the
Company’s short-term borrowings would result in a $6 million increase in short-term interest expense.
The Company’s risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and
the expected ability to recover price increases through rates, in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism, as authorized by each
regulatory jurisdiction. Non-performance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.
The market price of the Company’s common stock may experience fluctuations, which may be unrelated to its operating performance. In particular, the
Company’s stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. These
could include, among other things, interest rate movements, quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or
regulatory actions. This volatility may make it difficult for the Company to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of its common
stock or other equity securities, regardless of its financial performance, and such difficulty may preclude the Company from being able to take advantage of
certain business opportunities or meet business obligations.
The Company is exposed to credit risk through its water, wastewater and related services. The Company’s Regulated Businesses serve residential,
commercial, industrial and other customers, while the businesses within Other engage in business activities with government entities and other customers. The
Company’s primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment
of customer accounts receivable balances. The Company’s credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance
with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or
prepayment arrangements. The Company’s credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations. In addition, the Regulated
Businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs
through rates.
74
Table of Contents
The Company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can
impact the Company’s pension and other benefits expense, funded status and future minimum funding requirements. Changes in interest rates can impact
retirement liabilities. The Company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixed-income securities that have a
duration similar to that of its pension liabilities, seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities. That way, if interest rates fall and
liabilities increase, the Company expects that the fixed-income assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value. The Company also expects its risk to be
reduced through its ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates.
The Company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it
operates. The credit quality of the Company’s customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through
unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes. In addition, there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations.
Therefore, the Company’s ability to fully recover operating expense, recover its investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in the
Regulated Businesses may be adversely impacted.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
American Water Works Company, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).
We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing
a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Accounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated regulatory assets and liabilities balances were
$1,030 million and $1,595 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility
commissions and the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to
be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As disclosed by management, for each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts
business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and
regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory
environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same
jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit
matter are the significant judgment by management in accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities relative to whether regulatory assets continue to meet the
criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement as a result of changes in regulatory
environments, recent rate orders, and the status of any pending or potential legislation. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and
effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to management’s judgments.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s regulatory accounting process, including
controls over management’s assessment and consideration of factors related to the probability of future recovery or settlement. These procedures also included,
among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the probability of recovery and settlement based on the Company’s
correspondence with regulators, status of regulatory proceedings, past practices, and other relevant information; evaluating the related accounting and
disclosure implications; and evaluating regulatory assets and liabilities balances based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other
correspondence with the Company’s regulators.

American Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unless otherwise noted, in millions, except per share data)
Note 1: Organization and Operation
American Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company” or “American Water”) is a holding company for regulated and market-based subsidiaries that
provide water and wastewater services throughout the United States. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its
subsidiaries. The Company’s primary business involves the ownership of regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services in 14 states in the
United States, collectively referred to as the “Regulated Businesses.” The Company also operates other market-based businesses that provide water and
wastewater services within non-reportable operating segments, collectively presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K within “Other.” The
Company’s primary market-based businesses included within Other are the Military Services Group (“MSG”), which enters into long-term contracts with the
U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations; and the former Homeowner Services Group (“HOS”), which was
sold on December 9, 2021, and provided various warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers.
Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies
Regulation
The Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation,
collectively referred to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs”). As such, the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated
utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. PUCs generally authorize revenue at
levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments, or rate base. Regulators may also approve accounting
treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions
and relationships, reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Due to timing
and other differences in the collection of a regulated utility’s revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged
as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, these
principles also require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts
collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers. See Note 3—Regulatory Matters for additional information.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires that
management make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual
results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considers its critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of
regulatory accounting principles and the related determination and estimation of regulatory assets and liabilities, (ii) revenue recognition and the estimates used
in the calculation of unbilled revenue, (iii) accounting for income taxes, (iv) benefit plan assumptions and (v) the estimates and judgments used in determining
loss contingencies. The Company’s critical accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory
assets and liabilities, income taxes, benefit plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest
is maintained after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Company’s regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement
of retirement units of utility plant are capitalized and include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering
and supervision, transportation and an allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). Costs for repair, maintenance and minor replacements are
charged to O&M expense as incurred.
The cost of utility plant is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, group method. The Company’s regulated utilities record
depreciation in conformity with amounts approved by PUCs, after regulatory review of the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the
assets’ remaining useful lives.
85
Table of Contents
Nonutility property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the Company’s MSG business and for internal operations. This property is
stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.
When units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to
accumulated depreciation. To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a
regulatory asset is recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are
incurred. These amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to
retire those assets are incurred.
The costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of these
costs amounted to $369 million and $374 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds
Substantially all cash is invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are
considered to be cash equivalents.
Restricted funds consist primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future services
under O&M projects. Proceeds are held in escrow or interest-bearing accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or long-term based upon the intended use of the funds.
Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenues
Accounts receivable include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers generally
on a monthly basis. Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are market-based
trade accounts receivable and nonutility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. Unbilled revenues are accrued when service has been provided but
has not been billed to customers and when costs exceed billings on market-based construction contracts.
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
Allowances for uncollectible accounts are maintained for estimated probable losses resulting from the Company’s inability to collect receivables from
customers. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the
allowance for uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due, previous loss history, current economic and societal conditions and
reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of receivables from customers. The Company generally writes off accounts when they become
uncollectible or are over a certain number of days outstanding. See Note 7—Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts for additional information.
Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method.
Seller Promissory Note
The Company’s seller promissory note is accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 310, Receivables, and is classified as
held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost at the present value of consideration received for the sale of its HOS business. Interest income from the
seller promissory note is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and earned over the contractual life of the loan.
Leases
The Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. The Company
determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities and
operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and other long-
term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include operating leases with a lease term of
twelve months or less.
86
Table of Contents
ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments
arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are generally recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of discounted lease
payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the
information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of discounted lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily
determinable. ROU assets also include any upfront lease payments and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company has lease agreements with lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) and non-lease
components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs), which are generally accounted for separately; however, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease
components as a single lease component for certain leases. Certain lease agreements include variable rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation.
Additionally, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company’s lease agreements do not
contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of
a business. Goodwill is not amortized and must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested
for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying value.
The Company’s goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Company’s previous owner in 2003 and
has been allocated to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the reporting units
in the Regulated Businesses segment are aggregated into a single reporting unit. The goodwill of Other is comprised of the MSG reporting unit.
The Company’s annual impairment testing is performed as of November 30 of each year. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether
quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not,
greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment and
determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, is more likely than not, less than its carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based assessment is
performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying value, including goodwill, on the
measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair
value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Application of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value
of reporting units. Management estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include,
but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount rate and growth rate.
The Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the
assumptions and considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See
Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, include property, plant and equipment and long-term investments. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for
impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The Company determines if long-lived assets are
potentially impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value when indicators of impairment exist. When the
undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess
of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value.
The long-lived assets of the Company’s regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide
operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery
in rates of that asset is no longer probable.
The Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value long-lived assets to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs
from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Table of Contents
Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction
Regulated utility subsidiaries may receive advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction from customers, home builders and real
estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas.
Advances are refundable for limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. Included in
other current liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are estimated refunds of $19 million and $23 million,
respectively. These amounts represent expected refunds during the next 12-month period.
Advances that are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions. Contributions are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particular
construction project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-
investor supplied funds.
Generally, the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions balance as a reduction to depreciation expense,
producing a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable
regulatory guidelines, some of the Company’s utility subsidiaries do not amortize contributions, and any contribution received remains on the balance sheet
indefinitely. Amortization of contributions in aid of construction was $37 million, $36 million and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
Under ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers, and all related amendments (collectively, “ASC 606”), a performance obligation is a
promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to a customer. Revenue is recognized when
performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the
consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for goods or services. Under ASC 606, a contract’s transaction price is
allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of
ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identifies the contracts with a customer; (ii) identifies the performance obligations within the
contract, including whether any performance obligations are distinct and capable of being distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) determines the transaction
price; (iv) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizes revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies each
performance obligation.
The Company’s revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below. Customer payments for contracts are generally due within 30 days of
billing and none of the contracts with customers have payment terms that exceed one year; therefore, the Company elected to apply the significant financing
component practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.
Regulated Businesses Revenue
Revenue from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts
contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not
separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. Revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided.
There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled
amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period.
The amounts that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly
to the value transferred to the customer. The Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future
refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.
88
Table of Contents
Other Revenue
The Company has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military
installations and facilities owned by municipal customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the
contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make
capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-
alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance
obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during
the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are
recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract
performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are
determined. See Note 4—Revenue Recognition for additional information.
Prior to December 9, 2021, through various warranty protection programs and other home services, the Company previously provided fixed fee services
to residential customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters and other
home appliances, as well as power surge protection and other related services through its former HOS business. Most of the contracts had a one-year term and
each service was a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided from the
service. Customers were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably
over time for those services. Advances from customers were deferred until the performance obligation was satisfied.
Income Taxes
The Company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for U.S. tax purposes. Members of the consolidated group are
charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.
Certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The
Company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the
financial statements. These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to
reverse. In addition, the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax
effects of temporary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.
Investment tax credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives
of the related assets.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax
collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities on a net basis. See Note 14—Income Taxes for additional information.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
AFUDC is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity funds
devoted to plant under construction. The regulated utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable
to borrowed funds is shown as a reduction of interest, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equity funds
would be included in other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Presented in the table below is AFUDC for the years ended December 31:
 2022 2021 2020
Allowance for other funds used during construction $ 20 $ 27 $ 30 
Allowance for borrowed funds used during construction 14 10 13 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative
contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The
Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.
89
Table of Contents
All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the
derivative as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow
hedge).
The gains and losses on the effective portion of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the
variability of cash flows. Any ineffective portion of designated cash-flow hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.
Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note
11—Long-Term Debt for additional information.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees and retirees. The plan obligation
and costs of providing benefits under these plans are annually measured as of December 31. The measurement involves various factors, assumptions and
accounting elections. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is
recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive
Income. Cumulative gains and losses that are in excess of 10% of the greater of either the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are
amortized over the expected average remaining future service period of the current active membership for the plans, with the exception of the American Water
Pension Plan for Certain Inactive Participants (“AWPP Inactive”), which is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants.
See Note 15—Employee Benefits for additional information.
The Company’s policy is to recognize curtailments when the total expected future service of plan participants is reduced by greater than 10% due to an
event that results in terminations and/or retirements.

On December 15, 2022, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on
February 10, 2022, by the Company’s Illinois subsidiary. As updated in the Illinois subsidiary’s June 29, 2022 rebuttal filing, the request sought $83 million in
additional annualized revenues excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges. The general rate case order approved a $67 million annualized
increase in water and wastewater system revenues excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges, effective January 1, 2023, based on an authorized
return on equity of 9.8%, authorized rate base of $1.64 billion, a common equity ratio of 49.0% and a debt ratio of 51.0%. The annualized revenue increase is
being driven primarily by significant water and wastewater system capital investments since the Illinois subsidiary’s 2017 rate case order that have been
completed or are planned through December 31, 2023, expected higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and increases in production costs,
including chemicals, fuel and power costs.
On December 8, 2022, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving the joint settlement of the rate case filed on April 29,
2022, by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $138 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues
and authorizes implementation of the new water and wastewater rates effective January 28, 2023. The rate case proceeding was resolved through a “black box”
settlement agreement and did not specify an approved return on equity (“ROE”). The annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by significant incremental
capital investments since the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s 2021 rate case order that will be completed through December 31, 2023, increases in pension and other
postretirement benefits expense and increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order also includes recovery
of the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary’s COVID-19 deferral balance.
On August 17, 2022, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary was authorized additional annual revenues of $46 million in its general rate case, effective
September 1, 2022, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.6%, authorized rate base of $4.15 billion, a common equity ratio of 54.6% and a long-term
debt ratio of 45.4%. The request incorporated updated estimates of production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
Company’s New Jersey subsidiary will defer as a regulatory asset or liability, as appropriate, the difference between its pension expense and other
postretirement benefits expense and those amounts included in base rates. The deferral period for this regulatory asset or liability will be two years or, if earlier,
will end at the conclusion of the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary’s next general rate case. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary also withdrew its request,
without prejudice, to recover its existing authorized COVID-19-related regulatory asset in the general rate case and will seek recovery in a separate proceeding
within the process established in the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities’ (the “NJBPU”) generic COVID-19-related proceeding.
On February 24, 2022, the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary (“WVAWC”) was authorized additional annual revenues of $13 million in its general
rate case, effective February 25, 2022, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.8%, authorized rate base of $734 million and a common equity ratio of
47.9%. Staff of the Public Service Commission of West Virginia moved for reconsideration of the final order on several grounds. WVAWC filed its response to
the Staff's Petition for Reconsideration on March 28, 2022, in support of the authorized revenue requirement. On October 21, 2022, the Public Service
Commission of West Virginia denied the motion for reconsideration.
Pending General Rate Case Filings
On July 1, 2022, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting an increase in 2024 revenue of $56 million and a total increase
in revenue over the 2024 to 2026 period of $95 million, with all increases compared against 2022 revenues. The Company updated its filing in January 2023 to
capture the authorized step increase effective January 1, 2023. The filing was also updated to incorporate a decoupling proposal and a revision to the
Company’s sales and associated variable expense forecast. The revised requested additional annualized revenues for the test year 2024 is now $37 million,
compared against 2023 revenues. This excludes the proposed step rate and attrition rate increase for 2025 and 2026 of $20 million and $19 million,
respectively. The total revenue requirement request for the three-year rate case cycle, incorporating updates to present rate revenues and forecasted demand, is
$76 million.
On July 1, 2022, the Company’s Missouri subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $105 million in additional annualized revenues.
On November 15, 2021, the Company’s Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $14 million in additional annualized revenues. Interim
rates were effective on May 1, 2022, and the difference between interim and final approved rates is subject to refund. On September 26, 2022, a settlement
agreement, supported by all parties except one, was filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for a $11 million annual revenue increase. Public
hearings were held on September 27 and 28, 2022. A final decision on this matter is expected in the first quarter of 2023.
The Company’s California subsidiary submitted its application on May 3, 2021, to set its cost of capital for 2022 through 2024. According to the
CPUC’s procedural schedule, a decision setting the authorized cost of capital is expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2023.

Infrastructure Surcharges
A number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and
investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table

On November 18, 2022, the Company’s Indiana subsidiary filed an infrastructure surcharge proceeding requesting $7 million in additional annualized
revenues.
Other Regulatory Matters
In September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that required the Company’s
California subsidiary to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would become
effective in January 2024. On October 5, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the decision and following the
CPUC’s denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review with the California
Supreme Court on October 27, 2021. On May 18, 2022, the California Supreme Court issued a writ of review for the Company’s California subsidiary’s
petition and the petitions filed by other entities challenging the decision. Independent of the judicial challenge, California passed Senate Bill 1469, which
allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporation’s revenue and its water sales. Legislation
was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022, and became effective on January 1, 2023. In response to the legislation, on January 27, 2023, the
Company’s California subsidiary filed an updated application requesting the CPUC to consider a Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism in
its pending 2022 general rate case, which would be effective 2024 through 2026.

Table of Contents
On March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the NJBPU that
recommended denial of a petition filed by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million
associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfield’s water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July
29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJ’s initial decision without modification. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal
with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed its brief in support of the appeal on March 4,
2022. Response and Reply briefs were filed on June 22, 2022, and August 4, 2022, respectively. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the
NJBPU’s order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Regulatory Assets
Regulatory assets represent costs that are probable of recovery from customers in future rates. Approximately 50% of the Company’s total regulatory
asset balance at December 31, 2022 earns a return. Presented in the table below is the composition of regulatory assets as of December 31:
 2022 2021
Deferred pension expense $ 251 $ 323 
Removal costs recoverable through rates 307 313 
Regulatory balancing accounts 26 52 
Other 406 439 
Less: Regulatory assets included in assets held for sale (a) — (76)
Total regulatory assets $ 990 $ 1,051 
(a) These regulatory assets are related to the sale of the Company’s New York subsidiary, which was completed on January 1, 2022, and are included in assets held for sale on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.
The Company’s deferred pension expense includes a portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods of
$251 million and $317 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The remaining portion is the pension expense in excess of the amount
contributed to the pension plans which is deferred by certain subsidiaries and will be recovered in future service rates as contributions are made to the pension
plan.
Removal costs recoverable through rates represent costs incurred for removal of property, plant and equipment or other retirement costs.
Regulatory balancing accounts accumulate differences between revenues recognized and authorized revenue requirements until they are collected from
customers or are refunded. Regulatory balancing accounts include low income programs and purchased power and water accounts.
Other regulatory assets include the financial impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, purchase premium recoverable through rates, tank painting
costs, certain construction costs for treatment facilities, property tax stabilization, employee-related costs, business services project expenses, coastal water
project costs, rate case expenditures and environmental remediation costs among others. These costs are deferred because the amounts are being recovered in
rates or are probable of recovery through rates in future periods.
The Company has current regulatory assets of $40 million and $16 million included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is primarily made up of rate adjustment mechanisms.

Table of Contents
Regulatory Liabilities
Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers through the rate making process. Also, if
costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Company records those expected future costs as regulatory
liabilities. Presented in the table below is the composition of regulatory liabilities as of December 31:
 2022 2021
Income taxes recovered through rates $ 1,127 $ 1,093 
Removal costs recovered through rates 275 291 
Postretirement benefit liability 100 153 
Other 88 110 
Less: Regulatory liabilities included in liabilities related to assets held for sale (a) — (47)
Total regulatory liabilities $ 1,590 $ 1,600 
(a) These regulatory liabilities are related to the sale of the Company’s New York subsidiary, which was completed on January 1, 2022, and are included in liabilities related to assets held for sale
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.
Income taxes recovered through rates relate to deferred taxes that will likely be refunded to the Company’s customers. On December 22, 2017, the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The enactment of the TCJA required
a re-measurement of the Company’s deferred income taxes. The portion of this re-measurement related to the Regulated Businesses was substantially offset by
a regulatory liability as EADIT will be used to benefit its regulated customers in future rates. All of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are amortizing
EADIT and crediting customers.
Removal costs recovered through rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful lives that are recovered through customer
rates over the lives of the associated assets.
On August 31, 2018, the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect an announced plan amendment which changed benefits for
certain union and non-union plan participants. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company recorded a $227 million reduction to the net accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation, with a corresponding regulatory liability.
Other regulatory liabilities include the financial impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, TCJA reserve on revenue, pension and other
postretirement benefit balancing accounts, legal settlement proceeds, deferred gains and various regulatory balancing accounts.
The Company has current regulatory liabilities of $5 million and $8 million included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which primarily is made up of TCJA reserve on revenue.

Contract Balances
Contract assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. In the Company’s
MSG, certain contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of
contractual milestones. Contract assets are recorded when billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition and are reclassified to accounts receivable when
billed and the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities are recorded when the Company receives advances from customers prior to
satisfying contractual performance obligations, particularly for construction contracts, and are recognized as revenue when the associated performance
obligations are satisfied.
Contract assets of $86 million, $71 million and $39 million are included in unbilled revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were $161 million of contract assets added during 2022, and $146 million of contract assets were transferred to
accounts receivable during 2022. There were $71 million of contract assets added during 2021, and $39 million of contract assets were transferred to accounts
receivable during 2021.
Contract liabilities of $91 million, $19 million and $35 million are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were $189 million of contract liabilities added during 2022, and $117 million of contract liabilities
were recognized as revenue during 2022. There were $152 million of contract liabilities added during 2021, and $168 million of contract liabilities were
recognized as revenue during 2021.

Table of Contents
Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations (“RPOs”) represent revenues the Company expects to recognize in the future from contracts that are in progress.
The Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s O&M and capital improvement contracts in MSG and the Contract Services Group have RPOs. Contracts with the
U.S. government for work on various military installations expire between 2051 and 2071 and have RPOs of $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2022, as
measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Such contracts are subject to customary termination provisions held by the U.S. government, prior to the
agreed-upon contract expiration. Contracts with municipalities and commercial customers expire between 2026 and 2038 and have RPOs of $589 million as of
December 31, 2022, as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Some of the Company’s long-term contracts to operate and maintain the federal
government’s, a municipality’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain maintenance for some of
those facilities, in exchange for an annual fee. Unless specifically required to perform certain maintenance activities, the maintenance costs are recognized
when the maintenance is performed.
Note 5: Acquisitions and Divestitures
Regulated Businesses
Closed Acquisitions
During 2022, the Company closed on 26 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $335
million, of which $315 million was funded in 2022, which added approximately 70,000 water and wastewater customers, including the acquisition of the City
of York wastewater system assets noted below. Assets acquired from these acquisitions, principally utility plant, totaled $337 million and liabilities assumed
totaled $6 million. Several of these acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. The preliminary purchase price allocations related to acquisitions
accounted for as business combinations will be finalized once the valuation of assets acquired has been completed, no later than one year after their acquisition
date.
On May 27, 2022, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary acquired the public wastewater collection and treatment system assets from the York City
Sewer Authority and the City of York for a purchase price of $235 million, in cash, $20 million of which was funded as a deposit to the seller in April 2021 in
connection with the execution of the acquisition agreement. The system assets serve, directly and indirectly through bulk contracts, more than 45,000
customers. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the preliminary purchase price allocation will be finalized once the valuation of
assets acquired has been completed, no later than one year after the acquisition date. The preliminary purchase price allocation consisted primarily of $231
million of utility plant and $4 million of goodwill, which is reported in the Company’s Regulated Businesses segment.
During 2021, the Company closed on 23 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $112
million. Assets acquired from these acquisitions, principally utility plant, totaled $114 million and liabilities assumed totaled $2 million. Several of these
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations.
The pro forma impact of the Company’s acquisitions was not material to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020.
Pending Acquisitions
On October 11, 2022, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the wastewater assets of the Butler Area Sewer
Authority for a total purchase price of $232 million in cash, subject to adjustment as provided for in the Asset Purchase Agreement. This system provides
wastewater service for approximately 14,700 customer connections. The Company expects to close this acquisition by the end of 2023, pending regulatory
approval.
On March 29, 2021, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City for
$22 million. The water and wastewater systems currently serve approximately 1,500 customers each, or 3,000 combined, and are being sold through the New
Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act process. The Company expects to close this acquisition in early 2023.

Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc.
On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the previously disclosed sale of its regulated utility operations in New York to Liberty Utilities (Eastern
Water Holdings) Corp. (“Liberty”), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Liberty purchased from the Company all of the

Sale of Michigan American Water Company
On February 4, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its operations in Michigan for $6 million in cash.
Sale of Homeowner Services Group
On December 9, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the Company sold all of the equity interests in subsidiaries that comprised HOS to a wholly owned
subsidiary of funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, a global private equity advisory firm (the “Buyer”), for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion,
resulting in pre-tax gain of $748 million. The consideration is comprised of $480 million in cash, a seller promissory note issued by the Buyer in the principal
amount of $720 million, and a contingent cash payment of $75 million payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023. See
Note 18—Fair Value of Financial Information for additional information relating to the seller promissory note and contingent cash payment. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, the Company recorded post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital, of pre-tax income of $20 million, which is included
in Gain on sale of businesses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The seller note has a five-year term, is payable in cash, and bears interest at a rate of 7.00% per year during the term. The Company recognized $50
million of interest income during the year ended December 31, 2022, from the seller note. The repayment obligations of the Buyer under the seller note have
been secured by a first priority security interest in certain property of the Buyer and the former HOS subsidiaries, including their cash and securities accounts,
as well as a pledge of the equity interests in each of those subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. The seller note requires compliance with
affirmative and negative covenants (subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions), including a covenant limiting the incurrence by the Buyer and
certain affiliates of additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds, but does not include any financial maintenance covenants.
Beginning December 9, 2024, the Company has a put right pursuant to which it may require the seller note to be repaid in full at par, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, except that upon the occurrence of a disruption event in the broadly syndicated term loan “B” debt financing market, repayment by the Buyer
pursuant to the Company’s exercise of the put right will be delayed until the market disruption event ends.
The seller note may not be prepaid at the Buyer’s election except in certain limited circumstances before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. If
the Buyer seeks to repay the seller note in breach of this non-call provision, an event of default will occur under the seller note and the Company may, among
other actions, demand repayment in full together with a premium ranging from 105.5% to 107.5% of the outstanding principal amount of the loan and a
customary “make-whole” payment.

The Company and the Buyer also entered into a revenue share agreement, pursuant to which the Company is to receive 10% of the revenue generated
from customers who are billed for home warranty services through an applicable Company subsidiary (an “on-bill” arrangement), and 15% of the revenue
generated from any future on-bill arrangements entered into after the Closing Date. Unless earlier terminated, this agreement has a term of up to 15 years,
which may be renewed for up to two five-year periods. The Company recognized $9 million of income during the year ended December 31, 2022, from the
revenue share agreements, which is included in Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

January 1, 2022, and is included in assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.
Property, plant and equipment depreciation expense amounted to $552 million, $550 million and $520 million for the years ended December 31, 2022,
2021 and 2020, respectively and was included in depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The provision for
depreciation expressed as a percentage of the aggregate average depreciable asset balances was 2.60%, 2.77% and 2.82% for years December 31, 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively. Additionally, the Company had capital expenditures acquired on account but unpaid of $330 million and $292 million included in
accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
In 2019, the Company completed and submitted its project completion certification to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (“NJEDA”) in
connection with its capital investment in its corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The NJEDA determined that the Company was qualified to receive
$164 million in tax credits over a 10-year period. In October 2022, the NJEDA issued the Company a revised tax credit certificate in the amount of $161
million in tax credits to be received over the same 10-year period. The NJEDA denied previously approved capitalized interest cost amounting to $2.8 million.
As a result, the Company adjusted the amounts included in Property, plant and equipment.
The Company is required to meet various annual requirements in order to monetize one-tenth of the tax credits annually and is subject to a claw-back
period if the Company does not meet certain NJEDA requirements of the tax credit program in years 11 through 15.
One of the requirements to qualify for the release of credits annually is that the Company maintain a certain level of eligible positions at the qualified
business facility (“QBF”). Prior to March 2020, a full-time employee must have spent at least 80% of their time at the QBF to meet the definition of eligible
position or full-time job. On July 2, 2021, New Jersey’s Governor signed legislation that revised provisions of the Economic Recovery Act of 2020, which
lowered the 80% requirement for spending time at the QBF to 60% of the employee’s time.
101
Table of Contents
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the NJEDA implemented certain accommodations that temporarily waived the requirement that a full-time employee
spend the requisite percentage of time at the QBF to be eligible for the award under the program. This waiver expired on June 30, 2022.
On December 22, 2022, the New Jersey Governor signed legislation which provides an additional waiver to eligible businesses for the period of July 1,
2022 to December 31, 2023. Specifically, it allows businesses to waive the 60% on-site requirement if (i) full-time workers spend at least 10% of their work
hours at the QBF and (ii) the business pays NJEDA 5% of the amount of the tax credit the business receives for the 2022 tax period. The legislation also (i)
extends the time within which a business may terminate their participation in the program to December 31, 2023, without the NJEDA recapturing previously
distributed credits; (ii) extends the time allowed under current law for a business to suspend its obligations under the incentive agreement; (iii) extends the
provision to include the 2022 and 2023 tax periods; and (iv) renews and extends the right of a business to reduce the required full-time employees specified in
the incentive agreement to be eligible to receive the credit. The Company is considering all of its options as a result of the most recent legislation.
In December 2022, the NJEDA issued the utilization certificate for the 2019 tax credits to the Company in the amount of $16 million. The Company sold
these tax credits to external parties in December 2022 for $15 million. The loss on sale of credits was recorded to Other income (expense) in the Consolidated
Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, the Company had assets of $48 million and $97 million in Other current assets and
Other long-term assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. The Company has made the necessary annual filings for the
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, and expects to make the 2022 filing by April 30, 2023. The remaining submitted filings are under review by the
NJEDA and it is expected that the Company will receive final NJEDA approval and monetize the credits in 2023.

Table of Contents
In 2021, the Company reduced goodwill by $370 million included in Other through the sale of HOS. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures for
additional information relating to the sale of HOS.
The Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of November 30, 2022, which included qualitative assessments of its Regulated
Businesses and MSG reporting units. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that there were no factors present that would indicate that the fair
value of these reporting units was less than their respective carrying values as of November 30, 2022.
In 2022, the Company acquired goodwill of $4 million associated with one of its acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses segment.
Intangible Assets
The Company held finite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships and other intangible assets prior to the sale of HOS during the fourth
quarter of 2021. All of the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets were sold as part of the HOS sale transaction. As a result, there was no gross carrying value
or net book value of customer relationships and other intangible assets remaining as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Intangible asset
amortization expense amounted to $9 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There was no amortization
expense related to customer relationships and other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Note 9: Shareholders’ Equity
Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Company’s dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the “DRIP”), shareholders may reinvest cash common stock dividends and
purchase additional shares of Company common stock, up to certain limits, through the plan administrator without paying brokerage commissions. Shares
purchased by participants through the DRIP may be newly issued shares, treasury shares, or at the Company’s election, shares purchased by the plan
administrator in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Purchases generally will be made and credited to DRIP accounts once each week. As of
December 31, 2022, there were approximately 4.2 million shares available for future issuance under the DRIP.
Anti-dilutive Stock Repurchase Program
In February 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program, which allows the Company to purchase up to
10 million shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time over an unrestricted period of time. The Company did not repurchase shares of common
stock during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there were 5.1 million shares of common stock available for purchase
under the program.

The Company does not reclassify the amortization of defined benefit pension cost components from accumulated other comprehensive loss directly to
net income in its entirety, as a portion of these costs have been deferred as a regulatory asset. These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are
included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 15—Employee Benefits for additional information.
The amortization of the gain (loss) on cash flow hedges is reclassified to net income during the period incurred and is included in interest, net in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Dividends and Distributions
The Company’s Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is subject to
having access to sufficient sources of liquidity, net income and cash flows of the Company’s subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and direct and indirect
distributions from, and repayments of indebtedness of, the Company’s subsidiaries, compliance with Delaware corporate and other laws, compliance with the
contractual provisions of debt and other agreements and other factors.
The Company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among
other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect the Company’s income and cash flows. When dividends on common stock are declared,
they are typically paid in March, June, September and December. Historically, dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record as of a date less than 30
days prior to the distribution date. Since the dividends on the Company’s common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid.
During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company paid $467 million, $428 million and $389 million in cash dividends, respectively. Presented in the table
below is the per share cash dividends paid for the years ended December 31:
2022 2021 2020
December $ 0.6550 $ 0.6025 $ 0.55 
September $ 0.6550 $ 0.6025 $ 0.55 
June $ 0.6550 $ 0.6025 $ 0.55 
March $ 0.6025 $ 0.55 $ 0.50 
On December 7, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.6550 per share payable on March 1, 2023, to
shareholders of record as of February 7, 2023.
104
Table of Contents
Under applicable law, the Company’s subsidiaries may pay dividends on their capital stock or other equity only from retained, undistributed or current
earnings. A significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the amount of the dividend that the subsidiary can pay. The ability of the Company’s subsidiaries
to pay upstream dividends, make other upstream distributions or repay indebtedness to parent company or American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), the
Company’s wholly owned financing subsidiary, as applicable, is subject to compliance with applicable corporate, tax and other laws, regulatory restrictions and
financial and other contractual obligations, including, for example, (i) regulatory capital, surplus or net worth requirements, (ii) outstanding debt service
obligations, (iii) requirements to make preferred and preference stock dividend payments, and (iv) other contractual agreements, covenants or obligations made
or entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries.
Regulatory Restrictions on Indebtedness
The issuance of long-term debt or equity securities by the Company or long-term debt by AWCC does not require authorization of any state PUC if no
guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and parent company, AWCC may borrow funds or
issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide these borrowings to the Regulated Businesses or parent company. PUC
authorization is generally required for the regulated subsidiaries to incur long-term debt. The Company’s regulated subsidiaries normally obtain these required
PUC authorizations on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time, or, as necessary, in connection with a specific financing
or refinancing of debt.
Note 10: Stock Based Compensation
The Company has granted stock units, stock awards and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and employees pursuant to the terms of
the 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2017 Omnibus Plan”), approved by the Company’s shareholders in May 2017. Stock units under the 2017
Omnibus Plan generally vest based on (i) continued employment with the Company (“RSUs”), or (ii) continued employment with the Company where
distribution of the shares is subject to the satisfaction in whole or in part of stated performance-based goals (“PSUs”). A total of 7.2 million shares of common
stock may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 6.3 million shares were available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The
2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants of awards may be in any of the following forms: incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents. Dividend equivalents may be granted only on stock units or
other stock-based awards. The 2017 Omnibus Plan expires in 2027.
The Company had granted stock options, stock units, including RSUs and PSUs, and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and other
key employees of the Company under its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). The 2007 Plan has been replaced by the 2017 Omnibus
Plan, as defined above, and no additional awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan. However, shares may still be issued under the 2007 Plan pursuant to the
terms of awards previously issued under that plan prior to May 12, 2017.
The cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant date fair value of
the awards issued. The value of stock unit awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the requisite service period. All awards granted in
2022, 2021 and 2020 are classified as equity. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards over the vesting period of the award. The
Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimate employee forfeitures. The estimated rate is compared to the
actual forfeitures at the end of the reporting period and adjusted as necessary. There have been no significant adjustments to the forfeiture rates during 2022,
2021 and 2020. There were no grants of stock options to employees after 2016, and there were no stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
Presented in the table below is the stock-based compensation expense recorded in O&M expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations
for the years ended December 31:
 2022 2021 2020
RSUs and PSUs $ 26 $ 15 $ 19 
Nonqualified employee stock purchase plan 2 2 2 
Stock-based compensation 28 17 21

Stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 22 $ 13 $ 16 
There were no significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
105
Table of Contents
Subject to limitations on deductibility imposed by the Federal income tax code, the Company receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the
award at the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company
records the tax impacts related to compensation costs as deferred income tax assets. The tax deductions in excess of the deferred benefits recorded throughout
the requisite service period are recorded to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are presented in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows.
Stock Units
During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted RSUs to certain employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. RSUs generally vest based on continued
employment with the Company over periods ranging from one to three years. The RSUs are valued at the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the
date of the grant and the majority vest ratably over a three-year service period. These RSUs are amortized through expense over the requisite service period
using the straight-line method.
During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted stock units to non-employee directors under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The stock units were vested in
full on the date of grant; however, distribution of the shares will be made within 30 days of the earlier of (i) 15 months after the date of the last annual meeting
of shareholders, subject to any deferral election by the director, or (ii) the participant’s separation from service. Because these stock units vested on the grant
date, the total grant date fair value was recorded in operation and maintenance expense on the grant date.
Presented in the table below is RSU and director stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2022:

Non-vested total as of December 31, 2022 51 $ 130.43 
As of December 31, 2022, $5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested RSUs is expected to be recognized over the
weighted average remaining life of 1.69 years. The total fair value of stock units and RSUs vested was $6 million, $9 million and $5 million for the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted PSUs to certain employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The majority of PSUs vest ratably based
on continued employment with the Company over the three-year performance period (the “Performance Period”). Distribution of the performance shares is
contingent upon the achievement of one or more internal performance measures and, separately, a relative total shareholder return performance measure, over
the Performance Period.
Presented in the table below is PSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2022:

As of December 31, 2022, $6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested PSUs is expected to be recognized over the
weighted average remaining life of 0.93 years. The total fair value of PSUs vested was $24 million, $22 million and $18 million for the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
106
Table of Contents
PSUs granted with one or more internal performance measures are valued at the market value of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on
the date of grant. PSUs granted with a relative total shareholder return condition are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Expected volatility is based
on historical volatilities of traded common stock of the Company and comparative companies using daily stock prices over the past three years. The expected
term is three years and the risk-free interest rate is based on the three-year U.S. Treasury rate in effect as of the measurement date. Presented in the table below
are the weighted average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation and the weighted average grant date fair values of PSUs granted for the years ended
December 31:

Grant date fair value per share $99.23 $229.22 $159.64
The grant date fair value of PSUs that vest ratably and have market and/or performance conditions are amortized through expense over the requisite
service period using the graded-vesting method.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) that expires in 2027 through which employee participants (which
excludes certain of the Company’s executives) may use payroll deductions to acquire Company common stock at a purchase price of 85% of the fair market
value of the common stock at the end of a three-month purchase period. A total of 2.0 million shares may be issued under the ESPP, and as of December 31,
2022, there were 1.5 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP is considered compensatory. During the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued approximately 82,000, 80,000 and 86,000 shares, respectively, under the ESPP.
Note 11: Long-Term Debt
The Company obtains long-term debt through AWCC primarily to fund capital expenditures of the Regulated Businesses and to lend funds to parent
company to refinance debt and for other purposes. Presented in the table below are the components of long-term debt as of December 31:

Table of Contents
Long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, AWCC from issuing debt
secured by the Company’s consolidated assets. Certain long-term note indentures require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to
consolidated total capitalization (each as defined under the note indentures) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. The ratio as of December 31, 2022, was 0.62 to 1.00.
In addition, the Company has $891 million of notes which include the right to redeem the notes at par value, in whole or in part, from time to time, subject to
certain restrictions, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.87%.

On May 5, 2022, AWCC issued $800 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.45% senior notes due 2032. At closing, AWCC received, after
deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $792 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of
the offering: (i) to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations; and (iii) for general
corporate purposes.
One of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows
risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as treasury lock agreements. The Company also reduces exposure to
interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not
use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to
the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading,
creditworthy financial institutions having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.
108
Table of Contents
In April 2022, the Company entered into several 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $400 million, and an average fixed
interest rate of 2.89%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive gain or loss. In May 2022, the Company terminated the treasury lock agreements, realizing a net gain of approximately $4 million, to be
amortized through interest, net over a 10-year period, in accordance with the tenor of the debt issuance on May 5, 2022.
In November and December 2022, the Company entered into four 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $100 million, to
reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2023. These treasury lock agreements terminate in January 2024, and have an average fixed rate
of 3.56%. In January 2023, the Company entered into three additional 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $100 million, to reduce
interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2023. These treasury lock agreements terminate in January 2024, and have an average fixed rate of
3.35%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain
or loss. Upon termination, the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net over
the term of the new debt.
No ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.
Note 12: Short-Term Debt
Liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are generally funded through cash flows from operations,
public and private debt offerings, commercial paper markets and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the AWCC revolving credit facility, and, in
the future, issuances of equity. Additionally, proceeds from the aforementioned sales of HOS and the Company’s New York subsidiary have been used
primarily for capital investment in the Regulated Businesses. The revolving credit facility provides $2.75 billion in aggregate total commitments from a
diversified group of financial institutions. The termination date of the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility is October 2027. The
facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150
million for letters of credit. Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties.
Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an
aggregate of $500 million and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two one-year periods. As of December 31, 2022, AWCC had no outstanding
borrowings and $78 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, with $1.50 billion available to fulfill the Company’s short-term
liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. The Company regularly evaluates the capital markets and closely monitors the financial condition of the financial
institutions with contractual commitments in its revolving credit facility. Interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the Secured
Overnight Financing Rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate, each determined in accordance with Moody Investors Service’s and S&P Global
Ratings’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt.
On October 26, 2022, AWCC and certain lenders amended and restated the credit agreement with respect to the revolving credit facility to, among other
things, increase the maximum commitments under the facility from $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion and to extend the expiration date of the facility from March
2025 to October 2027. Also, effective October 26, 2022, the maximum aggregate principal amount of short-term borrowings authorized under AWCC’s
commercial paper program was increased from $2.10 billion to $2.60 billion.
On March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and among parent company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto (the “Term
Loan Facility”). The Term Loan Facility commitments terminated at maturity on March 19, 2021, and the $500 million of principal outstanding under the Term
Loan Facility was repaid in full. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bore interest at a variable annual rate based on LIBOR, plus a margin of 0.80%.
Short-term debt consists of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings totaling $1,177 million and $584 million as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively, or net of discount $1,175 million and $584 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on
AWCC’s outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 4.41%, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The weighted average interest rate on AWCC’s
outstanding short-term borrowings was 0.20%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there were no commercial paper borrowings
outstanding with maturities greater than three months.

The Company recognized no federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company fully utilized its
federal NOL carryforwards in 2021 due to the sale of HOS, and therefore, no valuation allowance is required.
111
Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had state NOLs of $240 million and $123 million, respectively, a portion of which are offset by a
valuation allowance as the Company does not believe these NOLs are more likely than not to be realized. The state NOL carryforwards expire in 2023 through
2042.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years on or before 2015. The Company
has state income tax examinations in progress and does not expect material adjustments to result.
Presented in the table below are the changes in gross liability, excluding interest and penalties, for unrecognized tax benefits:

Increases in current period tax positions 26 
Decreases in prior period measurement of tax positions (8)

The Company’s tax positions relate primarily to the deductions claimed for repair and maintenance costs on its utility plant. The Company does not
anticipate material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next year. As discussed above, the Company utilized its remaining federal NOLs in 2021,
and therefore this federal tax attribute will not be available to reduce the federal liabilities for uncertain tax positions or interest accrued as presented on the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
If the Company sustains all of its positions as of December 31, 2022, an unrecognized tax benefit of $10 million, excluding interest and penalties, would
impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had an immaterial amount of interest and penalties related to its tax positions as of December 31, 2022
and 2021.

Note 15: Employee Benefits
Overview of Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans
The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services
operations. Benefits under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for all new
employees. The pension plans were closed for most employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, except for
specific eligible groups specified in the plan, had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or
retirement. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006, are provided with a defined
contribution plan that includes a 5.25% of base pay Company-funded defined contribution account. The Company does not participate in a multi-employer
plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain
employees.
112
Table of Contents
The Company’s pension funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 or the normal cost. Further, the Company will consider additional cash contributions and/or available prefunding balances if needed to
avoid “at risk” status and benefit restrictions under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”). The Company may also consider increased contributions,
based on other financial requirements and the plans’ funded position. Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by
certain regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates charged for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. See Note 3—Regulatory
Matters for additional information. Pension plan assets are invested in a number of actively managed, commingled funds, and limited partnerships including
equities, fixed income securities, guaranteed annuity contracts with insurance companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).
In December 2022, the Company amended the American Water Pension Plan (“AWPP”), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, to restructure it as
of December 31, 2022. The restructuring involved the spin-off of certain inactive participants from the existing AWPP into a separate tax-qualified defined
benefit pension plan, AWPP Inactive. Benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. Actuarial gains and losses associated with AWPP Inactive
will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants, which increases the amortization period from approximately 7 years
to 18 years. The longer amortization period is expected to lower the Company’s pre-tax pension expense by approximately $5 million in 2023. The actuarial
gains and losses associated with the AWPP will continue to be amortized over the average remaining service period for active participants. The Company
remeasured the pension plan obligation and assets for each plan as of December 31, 2022.
The Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfare
plans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1,
2002. The Company’s policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up to the amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a
number of actively managed funds in the form of separate accounts, commingled funds and limited partnerships, including equities and fixed income securities.
Pension Plan Assets
The investment policy guideline of the pension plan is focused on diversification, improving returns and reducing the volatility of the funded status over
a long-term horizon. The investment policy guidelines of the postretirement plans focus on the appropriate strategy given the funded status of the plans. None
of the Company’s securities are included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets.
The Company uses fair value for all classes of assets in the calculation of market-related value of plan assets. As of December 31, 2022, the fair values
and asset allocations of the pension plan assets include the AWPP, AWPP Inactive, and the Shorelands Water Company, Inc. Pension Plan.
As a result of the sale of the Company’s New York subsidiary on January 1, 2022, there was a transfer of plan assets from the Company to Liberty. The
assets transferred were not a significant percentage of the Company’s overall pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
The Company’s postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and risk
mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored specifically for each trust. In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the
selected asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically
updates the long-term, strategic asset allocations for these plans through asset liability studies and uses various analytics to determine the optimal asset
allocation. Considerations include plan liability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns.
Upon evaluating prior plan changes, Company funding and market performance, in December 2022, the Company completed plan amendments to spin-
off and merge a portion of the American Water Retiree Welfare Plan (“Retiree Welfare Plan”), with and into the Company’s medical plan for active employees
(“Active Medical Plan”), in order to repurpose the over-funded portion of the Bargained Retiree Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“Bargained
VEBA”) trust. Benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. As a result of these changes, effective December 31, 2022, the Company transferred
investment assets from the Bargained VEBA into the existing trust maintained for the benefit of Active Medical Plan participants (“Active VEBA”). The
transfer of these Bargained VEBA investment assets into the Active VEBA permits access to approximately $194 million of assets for purposes of paying
active union employee medical benefits. The Company recorded the transfer of assets as a negative contribution and therefore did not record a gain or loss, as
permitted by accounting guidance. See Note 18—Fair Value of Financial Information, for additional information on accounting for the assets as investments in
debt and equity securities as of December 31, 2022.
The Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g., fixed
income, equity, alternatives) or strategy for which they have been appointed. Investment management agreements and recurring performance and attribution
analysis are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used
to adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan’s targeted investment policy.
In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to long duration fixed income investments that are
exposed to interest rate risk. Increases in interest rates generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of
the liabilities. Conversely, rate decreases will increase fixed income assets, partially offsetting the related increase in the liabilities. Within equities, risk is
mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process. For
the Bargained VEBA trust, its asset structure is designed to meet the cash flows of the liabilities. This design reduces the plan’s exposure to changes in interest
rates.
Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of
time it takes to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly
basis, if necessary. The Retiree Welfare Plan is funded by the Bargained VEBA trust, the Non-Bargained Retiree Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association
(“Non-Bargained VEBA”) trust, and the American Water Life Insurance Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“Life VEBA”) Trust.

Valuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value
Cash—Cash and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are
considered cash and are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.
Equity securities—For equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained from direct feeds from market
exchanges, that the Company is able to independently corroborate. Certain equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and
categorized as Level 1. Other equities, such as international securities held in the pension plan, are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships.
These funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since net asset value is not directly
observable or not available on a nationally recognized securities exchange for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2. For limited partnerships,
the assets as a whole are categorized as Level 3 due to the fact that the partnership provides the pricing and the pricing inputs are less readily observable. In
addition, the limited partnership vehicle cannot be readily traded.
Fixed-income securities—The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in
highly-liquid and transparent markets and their prices can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain
government bonds are based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities. They are categorized as
Level 2 because the valuations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. Exchange-traded
options and futures, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market
or exchange on which they are traded and are classified as Level 1.
117
Table of Contents
Real estate fund—Real estate fund is categorized as Level 3 as the fund uses significant unobservable inputs for fair value measurement and the vehicle
is in the form of a limited partnership.
REITs—REITs are invested in commingled funds. Commingled funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported
year-end net asset value. Since the net asset value is not directly observable for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2.
Guaranteed annuity contracts—Guaranteed annuity contracts are categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these
market values are determined by the provider, they are not highly observable and have been categorized as Level 3. Exchange-traded future and option
positions are reported in accordance with changes in variation margins that are settled daily.

Contributions
The PPA requires that defined benefit plans contribute to 100% of the current liability funding target over seven years. Defined benefit plans with a
funding status of less than 80% of the current liability are defined as being “at risk” and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply.
The Company’s qualified defined benefit plan is currently funded above the at-risk threshold, and therefore the Company expects that the plans will not be
subject to the “at risk” funding requirements of the PPA. The Company is proactively monitoring the plan’s funded status and projected contributions under the
law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.
Minimum funding requirements for the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined by government regulations and not by accounting
pronouncements. The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2023 to
the qualified pension plans. Contributions may be in the form of cash contributions as well as available prefunding balances.
Presented in the table below is information about the expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement benefit plans:

Because the above amounts are net benefits, plan participants’ contributions have been excluded from the expected benefits.
Assumptions
Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan
assets, the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed
annually. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to
changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the
Company recognizes.
Presented in the table below are the significant assumptions related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans:

NOTE     “N/A” in the table above means assumption is not applicable.
The discount rate assumption was determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently. The Company uses an approach that
approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected
maturity values of individually selected bonds. Historically, for each plan, the discount rate was developed at the level equivalent rate that would produce the
same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.
121
Table of Contents
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment
management fees, for current and planned asset classes in the plans’ investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans’ projected
asset classes were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the
target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio was developed, adjusted for historical and expected experience of
active portfolio management results compared to the benchmark returns. The Company’s pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases.
The Company used an expected return on plan assets of 6.50% to estimate its 2022 pension benefit costs, and an expected blended return based on weighted
assets of 3.60% to estimate its 2022 other postretirement benefit costs.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s mortality assumption utilized the Pri-2012 base mortality table and the new MP-2021
mortality improvement scale. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s mortality assumption utilized the Pri-2012 base mortality table and the
MP-2020 mortality improvement scale.

(a) Due to the amount of lump sum payment distributions from the Company’s New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, settlement charges of less than $1 million were recorded for
the year ended December 31, 2021. In accordance with existing regulatory accounting treatment, the Company has maintained the settlement charge in regulatory assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The amount is being amortized in accordance with existing regulatory practice.
Savings Plans for Employees
The Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions
that are invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employee’s contribution,
subject to certain limitations. Due to the Company’s discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006, the Company began
providing an additional 5.25% of base pay defined contribution benefit for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired
on or after January 1, 2006. The Company’s 401(k) savings plan expenses totaled $13 million, $14 million and $12 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Additionally, the Company’s 5.25% of base pay defined contribution benefit expenses totaled $16 million, $16 million and $15 million for 2022,
2021 and 2020, respectively. All of the Company’s contributions are invested in one or more funds at the direction of the employees.

Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of
the West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by WVAWC. The failure of the main caused water outages and low
pressure for up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the
repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers,
and to the remaining approximately 20% by the next morning. The second repair showed signs of leaking, but the water main was usable until June 29, 2015,
to allow tanks to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was being completed
safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully restored by July 1, 2015, to all customers affected by this event.
On June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries, et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha
County on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint
alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and
negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the
class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the
risk of pipe failure and a large outage.
123
Table of Contents
In February 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine the
applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if imposed. In July 2020, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the Jeffries plaintiffs’
motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denying certification of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. In August
2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacate or remand the Circuit Court’s order
certifying the issues class. In January 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of a
decision issued in another case relating to the class certification issues raised on appeal. On July 5, 2022, the Circuit Court entered an order again certifying a
class to address at trial certain liability issues but not to consider damages. On August 26, 2022, WVAWC filed another Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the
Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia challenging the West Virginia Circuit Court’s July 5, 2022 order. The Writ Petition has been supported by an
amicus brief filed by certain water and utility industry trade groups. On February 9, 2023, the Supreme Court of Appeals accepted the Writ Petition by issuing a
Rule to Show Cause and scheduling oral argument for April 26, 2023.
The Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has valid, meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint. WVAWC is
vigorously defending itself against these allegations. The Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any
loss or a range of such losses related to this proceeding.
Chattanooga, Tennessee Water Main Break Class Action Litigation
On September 12, 2019, the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary (“TAWC”), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water transmission main, which caused service
fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by early morning on September 14, 2019,
and restored full water service by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all customers on September 16, 2019.
On September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce, et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was filed in the Circuit Court of Hamilton
County, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and American Water Works Service Company, Inc. (“Service Company” and, together with TAWC and the
Company, collectively, the “Tennessee-American Water Defendants”), on behalf of a proposed class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered
monetary losses as a result of the Chattanooga incident (the “Tennessee Plaintiffs”). The complaint alleged breach of contract and negligence against the
Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. In the complaint as originally filed, the Tennessee
Plaintiffs were seeking an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and
enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. In September 2020,
the court dismissed all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ claims in their complaint, except for the breach of contract claims against TAWC, which remain pending. In
October 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties have been engaging in discovery. On January 12, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the court
issued an oral ruling denying the Tennessee Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On February 9, 2023, the Tennessee Plaintiffs sought reconsideration of
the ruling by the court, and any final ruling is appealable to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, as allowed under Tennessee law.
TAWC and the Company believe that TAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint, and TAWC is vigorously
defending itself against these allegations. The Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range
of such losses related to this proceeding.
Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions
Compliance with Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions—Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project
Under a 2009 order (the “2009 Order”) of the State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”), the Company’s California subsidiary (“Cal Am”) is
required to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule. In 2016, the SWRCB issued an
order (the “2016 Order,” and, together with the 2009 Order, the “Orders”) approving a deadline of December 31, 2021, for Cal Am’s compliance with these
prior orders.
Cal Am is currently involved in developing the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”), which includes the construction
of a desalination plant, to be owned by Cal Am, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply
Project also includes Cal Am’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water and the
Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”). The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill Cal Am’s obligations
under the Orders.
124
Table of Contents
Cal Am’s ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is subject to administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies,
obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In September 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision to authorize Cal Am to
enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to $50 million in associated
incurred costs plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria.
In September 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUC’s requirements for a
certificate of public convenience and necessity and an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUC’s 2018
decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost
recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Am’s cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, which amounted to an aggregate of $279 million plus
AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Am’s actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Am’s prudently
incurred costs associated with the Water Supply Project upon its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps,
operation and maintenance costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters. The reasonableness of the Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed by the
CPUC when Cal Am seeks cost recovery for the Water Supply Project. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset
significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting
program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUC costs associated with that program, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the
Water Supply Project in service. Cal Am has incurred $206 million in aggregate costs as of December 31, 2022, related to the Water Supply Project, which
includes $51 million in AFUDC.
In September 2021, Cal Am, Monterey One Water and the MPWMD reached an agreement on Cal Am’s purchase of additional water from an expansion
to the GWR Project, which is not expected to produce additional water until 2024 at the earliest. The amended and restated water purchase agreement for the
GWR Project expansion is subject to review and approval of the CPUC, and in November 2021, Cal Am filed an application with the CPUC that sought review
and approval of the amended and restated water purchase agreement. Cal Am also requested rate base treatment of the additional capital investment for certain
Cal Am facilities required to maximize the water supply from the expansion to the GWR Project and a related Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project, totaling
approximately $81 million. This requested amount is in addition to, and consistent in regulatory treatment with, the prior $50 million of cost recovery for
facilities associated with the original water purchase agreement, which was approved by the CPUC in its 2016 final decision.
On December 5, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision that authorizes Cal Am to enter into the amended water purchase agreement, and specifically to
increase pumping capacity and reliability of groundwater extraction from the Seaside Groundwater Basin. The final decision sets the cost cap for the proposed
facilities at approximately $62 million. Cal Am may seek recovery of amounts above the cost cap in a subsequent rate filing or general rate case. Additionally,
the final decision authorizes AFUDC at Cal Am’s actual weighted average cost of debt for most of the facilities.
On December 30, 2022, Cal Am filed with the CPUC an application for rehearing of the CPUC’s December 5, 2022 final decision. Cal Am is requesting
recovery of its infrastructure costs for the GWR Project expansion that had not been included in the December 2022 final decision. Cal Am believes that the
December 2022 final decision is contrary to the CPUC’s precedent and that obtaining recovery of these infrastructure costs is a key component of the GWR
Project expansion and Cal Am’s ability to meet the future water supply needs of its customers in Monterey. This application remains pending.
While Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the Orders, as well as the CPUC’s 2016 and 2018
final decisions, Cal Am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can be no
assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the $112 million in aggregate construction costs, plus applicable
AFUDC, previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 and December 2022 final decisions.

In 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application (the “Marina Application”) to the City of Marina (the “City”) for those project
components of the Water Supply Project located within the City’s coastal zone. Members of the City’s Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons,
have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the
Planning Commission of the Marina Application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the Coastal Commission, as permitted under the City’s code and
the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application (the “Original Jurisdiction Application”) to the Coastal Commission for a coastal
development permit for those project components located within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction. After Coastal Commission staff issued reports
recommending denial of the Original Jurisdiction Application, noting potential impacts on environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands and possible
disproportionate impacts to communities of concern, in September 2020, Cal Am withdrew the Original Jurisdiction Application in order to address the staff’s
environmental justice concerns. The withdrawal of the Original Jurisdiction Application did not impact Cal Am’s appeal of the City’s denial of the Marina
Application, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. In November 2020, Cal Am refiled the Original Jurisdiction Application.
On October 5, 2022, Cal Am announced a phasing plan for the proposed desalination plant component of the Water Supply Project. The desalination
plant and slant wells originally approved by the CPUC would produce up to 6.4 million gallons of desalinated water per day. Under the phased approach, the
facilities would initially be constructed to produce up to 4.8 million gallons per day of desalinated water, enough to meet anticipated demand through about
2030, and would limit the number of slant wells initially constructed. As demand increases in the future, desalination facilities would be expanded to meet the
additional demand. The phased approach seeks to meet near-term demand by allowing for additional supply as it becomes needed, while also providing an
opportunity for regional future public participation and was developed by Cal Am based on feedback received from the community.
On November 18, 2022, the Coastal Commission approved the Marina Application and the Original Jurisdiction Application with respect to the phased
development of the proposed desalination plant, subject to compliance with a number of conditions, all of which Cal Am expects to satisfy. On December 29,
2022, the City, Marina Coast Water District (“MCWD”), MCWD’s groundwater sustainability agency, and the MPWMD jointly filed a petition for writ of
mandate in Monterey County Superior Court against the Coastal Commission, alleging that the Coastal Commission violated the California Coastal Act and the
California Environmental Quality Act in issuing a coastal development permit to Cal Am for construction of the MPWSP slant wells. Cal Am is named as a real
party in interest. This matter remains pending.
Following the issuance of the coastal development permit, Cal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary
information in connection with obtaining the remaining required permits for the Water Supply Project. However, there can be no assurance that the Water
Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Cal Am has complied with the
diversion limitations contained in the 2016 Order. Continued compliance with the diversion limitations in 2023 and future years may be impacted by a number
of factors, including without limitation continued drought conditions in California and the exhaustion of water supply reserves, and will require successful
development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The Orders remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the
SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company
cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the Orders may result in
material additional costs and obligations to Cal Am, including fines and penalties against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the Orders.
West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill
On June 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted final approval of a settlement class and global class action
settlement (the “Settlement”) for all claims and potential claims by all class members (collectively, the “West Virginia Plaintiffs”) arising out of the January
2014 Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill in West Virginia. The effective date of the Settlement was July 16, 2018. Under the terms and conditions of the
Settlement, WVAWC and certain other Company affiliated entities did not admit, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the
West Virginia Plaintiffs in any of the actions that were resolved.
As of December 31, 2022, $0.5 million of the aggregate Settlement amount of $126 million remains reflected in accrued liabilities, and $0.5 million in
an offsetting insurance receivable remains reflected in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets pending resolution of all asserted actual or
potential claims associated with this matter. The amount reflected in accrued liabilities reflects the status of the liability and the offsetting insurance receivable
reflected in other current assets, each as of as of December 31, 2022.

Note 17: Earnings per Common Share
Presented in the table below is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for the basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) calculations for
the years ended December 31:
 2022 2021 2020
Numerator:    
Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 820 $ 1,263 $ 709 
Denominator:    
Weighted average common shares outstanding—Basic 182 182 181 
Effect of dilutive common stock equivalents — — 1 
Weighted average common shares outstanding—Diluted 182 182 182 
The effect of dilutive common stock equivalents is related to outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs granted under the Company’s 2007 Plan and
outstanding RSUs and PSUs granted under the Company’s 2017 Omnibus Plan, as well as estimated shares to be purchased under the ESPP. Less than one
million share-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, because their effect
would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.
Note 18: Fair Value of Financial Information
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:
Current assets and current liabilities—The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities,
including revolving credit debt, due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values.
Seller promissory note from the sale of HOS — The carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the seller promissory note from
the sale of HOS is $720 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. This amount represents the principal amount owed under the seller note, for which the
Company expects to receive full payment. The accounting fair value measurement of the seller note approximated $686 million and $720 million as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The accounting fair value measurement is an estimate that is reflective of changes in benchmark interest rates. The
seller note is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
Preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt—The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption
requirements and long-term debt are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs that are used to value each instrument. The fair value of
long-term debt classified as Level 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3
instruments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs.
Presented in the tables below are the carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting, and
the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments:
As of December 31, 2022

Long-term debt (excluding finance lease
obligations) 10,396 10,121 60 1,637 11,818 
Fair Value Measurements
To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting
date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities, exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds and
money market funds.
Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through
corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based
derivatives, commingled investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and fair-value hedges.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs, such as internally-developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or
liability. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds
subject to purchase and sale restrictions.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
Presented in the tables below are assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value
hierarchy:

Deferred compensation obligations 27 — — 27 
Total liabilities 27 — — 27 
Total net assets $ 61 $ — $ 72 $ 133 
Restricted funds—The Company’s restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement
of facilities and from customers for future services under operation, maintenance and repair projects.
Rabbi trust investments—The Company’s rabbi trust investments consist of equity and index funds from which supplemental executive retirement plan
benefits and deferred compensation obligations can be paid. The Company includes these assets in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Deposits—Deposits include escrow funds and certain other deposits held in trust. The Company includes cash deposits in other current assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Deferred compensation obligations—The Company’s deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into notional
investment accounts. The Company includes such plans in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Company’s deferred
compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants’ notional investment accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily of
mutual funds, which are based on observable market prices.
Mark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities—The Company employs derivative financial instruments in the form of treasury lock agreements,
classified as cash flow hedges, in order to fix the interest cost on existing or forecasted debt. The Company uses a calculation of future cash inflows and
estimated future outflows, which are discounted, to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract
terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility.
Other investments— As a result of the Retiree Welfare Plan changes discussed in Note 15—Employee Benefits, effective December 31, 2022, the
Company transferred investment assets from the Bargained VEBA into the existing trust maintained for the benefit of the Active VEBA. The transfer of these
Bargained VEBA investment assets into the Active VEBA permits access to approximately $194 million of assets for purposes of paying active union employee
medical benefits.
The investments in the Active VEBA primarily consist of money market funds and available-for-sale fixed income securities. The money market and
other investments have original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The fair value measurement of the money market and other investments is
based on observable market prices and therefore included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1. The available-for-sale fixed income
securities are primarily investments in U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds. The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have
been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain U.S. Treasury securities are based on prices that reflect
observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, and are therefore categorized as Level 2, because the valuations are
calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. The Company includes other investments of $67 million
and $147 million in Other current assets and Other long-term assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022. Other
investments as of December 31, 2021, are included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Table of Contents
The fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale fixed income securities, summarized by contractual maturities, as of December 31, 2022, is as
follows:
Amount
Other investments - Available-for-sale fixed-income securities
Less than one year $ 61 
1 year - 5 years 79 
5 years - 10 years 3 
Greater than 10 years 10 
Total $ 153 
Contingent cash payment from the sale of HOS—The Company’s contingent cash payment derivative included as part of the consideration from the sale
of HOS is included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the contingent cash payment is $72 million, which is reflective
of changes in the benchmark interest rate and estimated using the probability of the outcome of receipt of the $75 million, a Level 3 input.
Note 19: Leases
The Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. Certain operating
leases have renewal options ranging from one to 60 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. Renewal options that the
Company was reasonably certain to exercise are included in the Company’s ROU assets. Certain operating leases contain the option to purchase the leased
property. The operating leases for real property, vehicles and equipment will expire over the next 37 years, six years, and four years, respectively.
The Company participates in a number of arrangements with various public entities (“Partners”) in West Virginia. Under these arrangements, the
Company transferred a portion of its utility plant to the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”) issued
by the Partners under the Industrial Development and Commercial Development Bond Act. The Company leased back the utility plant under agreements for a
period of 30 to 40 years. The Company has recorded these agreements as finance leases in property, plant and equipment, as ownership of the assets will revert
back to the Company at the end of the lease term. The carrying value of the finance lease assets was $145 million and $146 million as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. The Company determined that the finance lease obligations and the investments in IDBs meet the conditions for offsetting, and as such,
are reported net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and excluded from the finance lease disclosure presented below.
The Company also enters into O&M agreements with the Partners. The Company pays an annual fee for use of the Partners’ assets in performing under
the O&M agreements. The O&M agreements are recorded as operating leases, and future annual use fees of $4 million in 2023 through 2027, and $45 million
thereafter, are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Rental expenses under operating and finance leases were $12 million, $13 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash paid for amounts in lease liabilities, which includes operating and financing cash flows from operating and
finance leases, was $12 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities was $5 million.
As of December 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term of the finance lease and operating leases were three years and 18 years,
respectively, and the weighted-average discount rate of the finance lease and operating leases were 12% and 4%, respectively.
The future maturities of lease liabilities at December 31, 2022, are $9 million in 2023, $10 million in 2024, $8 million in 2025, $7 million in 2026, $6
million in 2027 and $76 million thereafter. At December 31, 2022, imputed interest was $39 million.

Note 20: Segment Information
The Company’s operating segments are comprised of its businesses which generate revenue, incur expense and have separate financial information
which is regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its businesses
primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The Regulated Businesses segment is the largest component of the Company’s
business and includes subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services to customers in 14 states.
The Company also operates other market-based businesses, primarily MSG, which provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on
military installations, as well as municipalities. These market-based businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP, and
are collectively presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K within “Other,” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these
businesses. The Company’s former HOS business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2021, was included in “Market-Based Businesses” in the Company’s
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result of the sale of HOS, the categories which were previously shown as “Market-Based Businesses”
and “Other” have been combined and are shown as Other. Segment results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, have been adjusted
retrospectively to reflect this change.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies. The Regulated Businesses segment
includes intercompany costs that are allocated by Service Company and intercompany interest that is charged by AWCC, both of which are eliminated to
reconcile to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inter-segment revenues include the sale of water from a regulated subsidiary to market-based
subsidiaries, leased office space, and furniture and equipment provided by the market-based subsidiaries to regulated subsidiaries. Other also includes corporate
costs that are not allocated to the Company’s Regulated Businesses, interest income related to the seller promissory note and income from the revenue share
agreement from the sale of HOS, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments related to acquisitions that have not been allocated to the
Regulated Businesses segment. The adjustments related to the acquisitions are reported in Other as they are excluded from segment performance measures
evaluated by management.

ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its
assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and its directors, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of its internal
control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2022, using the criteria described in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Based on the Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), its management concluded that its internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company concluded that there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during its last fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.22
DESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC.’S EQUITY SECURITIES
The following description of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), of American Water Works Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”), is not intended to be complete. For more information regarding the Common Stock, please refer to the Company’s Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), and the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), which have been included
as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively, to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. The following descriptions
are based on the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect as of February 15, 2023. The terms and provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws are hereby incorporated by reference herein. The terms of these securities also may be affected by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the “DGCL”).
General
The Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of January 31,
2023, there were 181,858,619 shares of Common Stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
Common Stock
Voting Rights
Other than with respect to director elections, except as otherwise required by law, all matters to be voted on by the Company’s shareholders must be
approved by a majority of the shares present in person or proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. With respect to uncontested director
elections, the Bylaws require that in order to be elected, a director nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast (for this purpose, a majority of the votes
cast means that the number of shares voted “for” a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that nominee). For contested director
elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the Bylaws require that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a
plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.
Dividends
Holders of Common Stock will share equally in any dividend declared by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), subject to the rights of the
holders of any outstanding preferred stock.
Liquidation Rights
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company’s affairs, holders of Common Stock would be
entitled, after payment of the liquidation preference to all holders of any outstanding preferred stock, to share ratably in the Company’s assets that are legally
available for distribution to shareholders after payment of liabilities. The Company must pay the applicable distribution to any holders of its preferred stock
before it may pay distributions to the holders of Common Stock.
Other Rights
The Company’s shareholders have no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for additional shares.
Preferred Stock
The Board may authorize the issuance of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series, without shareholder approval. Subject to the limits
imposed by the DGCL, the Board is authorized to fix for any series of preferred stock the number of shares of such series and the voting powers (if any),
designation, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series. The Board is
also authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any
further vote or action by the Company’s shareholders.
The Board may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that affect adversely the voting power or other rights of
holders of Common Stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes,
could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, causing the market price of a share of Common Stock to decline, or impairing the
voting and other rights of the holders of Common Stock.
1
Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the DGCL
The following provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, even if
doing so would benefit the Company’s shareholders.
Undesignated Preferred Stock
The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for the Board to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with super voting,
special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire the Company. These
and other provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of the Company.
Requirements for Advance Notification of Shareholder Meetings, Nominations and Proposals
The Bylaws provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called only upon the request of the majority of the members of the Board, upon
request of the Chairman of the Board, or by the Secretary of the Company upon request of shareholders holding at least 15% of the outstanding Common
Stock. The Bylaws prohibit the conduct of any business at a special meeting other than as specified in the notice for such meeting.
The Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals for annual meetings and the nomination of candidates for election
as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof. A shareholder who wishes to bring a matter before a
meeting or submit candidates for nomination as directors must comply with the Company’s advance notice requirements and provide the Company with certain
information, and, if applicable under the Bylaws, provide to the Company certain agreements and undertakings. Additionally, vacancies and newly created
directorships may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, even though less than a quorum, or by shareholders. These
provisions may defer, delay or discourage a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or
otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.
Shareholder Action by Written Consent
As permitted by Section 228 of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation states that any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company’s
shareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and may not be effected by consent in writing by such shareholders.
Approval of Acquisition of Control by Public Utility Commissions
A significant number of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are subject to economic regulation by state public utility commissions. Some of these
states have enacted laws that require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of any regulated utility. In those states, obtaining “control” of the
parent or any other company that controls a regulated utility also requires prior regulatory approval. The threshold for a change in control is a fact-specific
inquiry that varies by state. For example, in some states, a presumption of control will arise when an acquiring party acquires more than 9.9% of the voting
securities of the regulated utility or the controlling entity. In addition to ownership, other states may analyze the degree of influence or control an acquiror may
exert over the company. Any person acquiring Common Stock in an offering or in any other purchase of Common Stock in an amount sufficient to trigger a
change in control under state law would need the prior approval of the applicable state public utility commission.
Certain Other Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the DGCL
Board of Directors
The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the number of directors is fixed in the manner provided in the Bylaws. The Bylaws provide that the
number of directors will be fixed from time to time by the Board.
Business Combinations under the DGCL
The Company is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business
combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the time the shareholder became an “interested stockholder,” subject to certain
exceptions, including if, prior to such time, the board of directors approved the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder
becoming an “interested stockholder.” “Business combinations” include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the
“interested stockholder.” Subject to various exceptions, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns, or
within the prior three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. These restrictions generally prohibit or delay
2
the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change-in-control attempts that are not approved by a company’s board of directors.
Limitations of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers
The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages
for breaches of directors’ fiduciary duties. The Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary
damages for actions taken as a director to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. The DGCL does not permit exculpation for liability:
•for breach of the duty of loyalty;
•for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law;
•under Section 174 of the DGCL (relating to unlawful dividends or stock repurchases); or
•for transactions from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law.
The Bylaws also expressly authorize the Company to carry directors’ and officers’ insurance providing indemnification for its directors, officers and certain
employees and agents for certain liabilities.
The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage shareholders from bringing a
lawsuit against the Company’s directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative
litigation against the Company’s directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and its shareholders. In
addition, an investment in the Common Stock may be adversely affected to the extent the Company pays the costs of settlement and damage awards against
directors and officers in accordance with these indemnification provisions.
Proxy Access
The Bylaws permit an eligible shareholder or group of shareholders to include up to a specified number of director nominees in the Company’s proxy
materials for an annual meeting of shareholders. To qualify, the shareholders (or group of up to 20 shareholders) must have continuously owned for at least
three years 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The maximum number of shareholder nominees permitted under this proxy access
provision is the greater of (i) two or (ii) 20% of the total number of directors on the Company’s board of directors as of the last day on which a proxy access
notice may be submitted, rounded down to the nearest whole number.
Transfer Agent and Registrar
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC serves as the registrar and transfer agent for the Common Stock.
New York Stock Exchange Listing
The Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “AWK.”

(amended as of January 20, 2022)
AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMP ANY , INC.
2017 OMNIBUS EQUITY  COMPENSA TION PLAN
PERFORMANCE ST OCK UNIT  GRANT
This PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT  GRANT , dated as of February 16, 2021 (the “Date of Grant ”), is delivered by
American Water Works Company , Inc. (the “ Company ”) to ____________________ (the “ Participant ”).
RECIT ALS
WHEREAS, the Committee (as defined in the American Water Works Company , Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation
Plan (the “Plan”)) has adopted a 2021 Long Term Performance Plan (“2021 LTPP”) pursuant to which  designated employees will be
granted equity awards (collectively , the “Equity Award”) for shares of Common Stock of the Company , par value $0.01 per share
(the “ Company Stock ”);
WHEREAS, the Equity Award is compr ised of three separate grants: a restricted stock unit and two performance stock unit
grants;
WHEREAS, the Committee has determ ined that the Participant is eligible to participate in the 2021 LTPP and to grant the
Participant an Equity Award under the 2021 L TPP; and
WHEREAS, the Committee has determined that the performance stock unit portion of the Equity Award granted to the
Participant pursuant to the 2021 LTPP shall be issued under the Plan, and the terms and conditions of the performance stock unit
grant that may be earned based on Performance Goals (defined below) relating to compounded earnings per share, as set forth in
Exhibit A attached hereto, shall be memorialized in this grant (the “ Grant ”).
NOW , THEREFORE, the parties to this Grant, intending to be legally bound hereby , agree as follows:
1. Grant of Performance Stock Units . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Grant and the Plan, the Company
hereby grants to the Participant _____________ performance stock units (the “Performance Units ”). The Performanc e Units are
contingently awarded and will be earned  and distributable if and only to the extent that the Performance Goals and other conditions
set forth in this Grant are met. Each Performance Unit shall be a phantom right and shall be equivalent to one share of Company
Stock on the applicable payment date, as described in Paragraph 5 below . The number of Performance Units set forth above is equal
to the target numbe r of shares of Company Stock that the Participant will earn for 100% achievement of the Performance Goals
described in this Grant (the “ Target Award ”).
2. Performance Unit Account . The Company shall establish and maintain a Performance Unit account as a bookkeeping account
on its records (the “ Performance Unit Account ”) for the Participant and shall record in such Performance Unit Account the number
of Performance Units granted to the Participant. The Participant shall not have any interest in any fund or specific assets of the
Company by reason of this grant or the Performance Unit Account established for the Participant.
3. Performance Goals .
(a) Unless a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period (as defined below),
the distrib ution of the shares of Company Stock attributable to the Perform ance Units is contingent upon achievement of the
performance goals set forth in Exhibit A attac hed hereto (the “Performance Goals ”) and the Participant satisfying the continuation of
employment and service with the Employer (as defined in the Plan) requirement described in Paragraph 4 below .
(b) As soon as administratively practicable following the end of the Performance Period (as defined in Paragraph 3(d)
below), the Committee will determine  whether and to what extent the Performance Goals have been met and the number of
Performance Units the Participant has earned, if any. Except as described in Paragraph 4 below , the Participant must be employed by,
or providing service to, the Employer on the last day of the Performance Period in order to earn the Performance Units.
(c) If a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Company is not the surviving
corporation (or survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation or entity (the “surviving corporation ”)) and the Performance
Units are not converted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), then
the Perform ance Period will end on the date of the Change of Control and the Performance Units will be deemed earned at the Target
Award level as of the date of the Change of Control (the “Change of Control Date”). In the event the Participant’ s Performance Units
are assum ed by the surviving corporat ion but the Participant ceases to be employed by, or providing service to, the surviving
corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation) within twelve (12) months after the date of the Change of Control
on accoun t of (i) a termination of such Participant’ s employment by the surviving corporation (or a parent of subsidiary of the
surviving corporation) for any reason other than on account of Cause (as defined  in paragraph 4(c) hereof), or on account of death or
Disability (each as defined in the Plan), or (ii) a termination of employment or service by the Participant for Good Reason (as
defined in the Plan), then the Performance Period will end on the date of such termination of employment or service (the
“Termination Date ”) and the Performa nce Units will be deemed earned at the Target Award level as of the Termination Date. For
purposes of this Grant, “Change of Control ” shall mean as such term is defined in the Plan, except that a Change of Contro l shall not
be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Grant unless the event constituting the Change of Control constitutes a change in
ownership or effective control of the Company , or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company , within the
meaning of section 409A  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “ Code ”) and its corresponding regulations.
(d) For purposes of this Grant, the term “Performance Period” shall mean the three (3)-year period beginning on
January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2023.
4. Termination of Employment or Service .
(a) Except as set forth in Paragraph 3(c), if, at least one year after the beginning of the Performance Period, but prior to
the end of the Performance Period, the Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer on account of any
reason other than a termination for Cause (as defined below), the Participant will earn a pro-rata portion of the Performance Units, if
the Performance Goals and the requirements of this Grant are met as of the
2
last day of the Performance Period. The pro-rata portion earned will be equal to the number of Performance Units that would have
been earned if the Participant had remained employed through the last day of the Performance Period, multiplied by a fraction,
which fraction shall be equal to (i) 1/3, if the Participant’ s employment or service with the Employer terminates on or after January
31, 2022, but prior to January 31, 2023; (ii) 2/3, if the Participant’ s employmen t or service with the Employer terminates on or after
January 31, 2023, but prior to January 31, 2024; and (iii) 3/3, if the Partic ipant’ s employment or service terminates with the
Employer on or after January 31, 2024. If the Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer for any
reason other than on account of Caus e, the prorated number of Performanc e Units earned by the Participant pursuant to this
Paragraph 4(a) will be distributed in accordance with Paragraph 5.
(b) If at any time prior to the earlier of January 31, 2022 or a Change of Control, the Participant’ s employment or service
with the Employer is terminated by the Employer on account of any reason or no reason or by the Participant for any reason or no
reason, all of the Performance Units subject to this Grant shall be immediately forfeited as of the date of the Participant’ s termination
of employment or service with the Employer and the Participant shall not have any rights with respect to the distribution of any
portion of the Performance Units.
(c) If at any time prior to the date the Perfo rmance Units are distributed in accordance with Paragraph 5 the Participant’ s
employment or service with the Employ er is terminated on account of Cause, all of the Performance Units subject to this Grant shall
be immediately forfeited and the Participant will not have any rights with respect to the distribution of any portion of the
Performance Units, irrespective of the level of achievement of the Performance Goals. For purposes of this Grant, “Cause ” shall
mean a finding by the Committee that the Participant (i) has breached his or her employment or service contract with the Employer ,
if any; (ii) has engaged in disloyalty to the Employer , including, without limitation, fraud, embezzlement, theft, commission of a
felony or proven dishonesty; (iii) has disclosed trade secrets or confidential information of the Employer to persons not entitled to
receive such information; (iv) has breached any written noncompetition or non-solicitation agreement between the Participant and
the Employer; or (v) has engaged in such other behavior detrimental to the interests of the Employer as the Committee determines.
5. Time and Form of Payment with Respect to Performance Units . Unless an election  is made pursuant to Paragraph 6 below ,
the Partici pant will receive a distributio n with respect to the Performance Units earned as described in Paragraphs 3 and 4 above
within seventy (70) days following the earliest of (a) January 31, 2024 (the “Distribution Date ”), (b) the Change of Control Date, or
(c) the Termination  Date. The Perform ance Units will be distributed in shares of Company Stock, with each Performance Unit
earned equivalent to one share of Company Stock. Any Performance Units not earned because of the failure to attain the
Performance Goals and service condition will be immediately forfeited.
6. Deferrals . The Participant may make an irrevocable election to defer the Distribution Date (or further defer the Deferred Date
(as define d below), if applicable) of all of the Performance Units that are earned, plus dividend equivalents earned on such
Performance Units as described in Paragraph 7 below , to a later date, provided that, except as to any election made by the Participant
to accelerate the Deferred Date in the event of his or her death prior to the Defer red Date, (a) the election shall not take effect until at
least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made, (b) the deferred Distribution Date cannot be earlier than five
3
(5) years from the original Distribution  Date under Paragraph 5 above (or five (5) years from the applicable Deferred Date, if a
subsequent deferral of a Deferred Date is being made), and (c) the election must be made no less than twelve (12) months prior to
the date of the Distribution Date (twelve (12) months prior to the previously applicable Deferred Date, if a subsequent deferral of a
Deferred Date is being made). To defer the Distribution Date, the Participant must elect to defer 100% of the Performance Units,
including corresponding dividend equivalents, earned by the Participant under this Grant, as well as 100% of the other performance
stock units, including corresponding dividend equivalents, earned by the Participant under the 2021 LTPP, complete the deferral
election form provided to the Participan t, and return such form to the Company  in the manner and by the deadline provided therein.
If the Participant desires to make a further deferral, the Participant must make  such election on a separate form provided for such
purpose. Any such election shall be made in accordance with section 409A  of the Code and any corresponding guidance and
regulations issued under section 409A  of the Code. Notwithstanding a Participant’ s election pursuant to this Paragraph, if the Change
of Control Date or the Termination Date occurs prior to the Deferred Date, the distribution of the Participant’ s earned Performance
Units, plus corresponding dividend, equivalents will be the Change of Control Date or the Termination Date, as applicable. If a
Distribution Date is delayed one or more times pursuant to any election made by the Participant pursuant to this Paragraph 6, the
new Distribution Date shall be referred to as the “Deferred Date.”
7. Dividend Equivalen ts. Until the earlier of the Distribution Date (or the Deferred Date, if elected), the Change of Control Date
or the Termination Date, if any dividen ds are paid with respect to the shares of Company Stock, the Company shall credit to a

“PSU GRANT B – EPS”
EXHIBIT  A
PERFORMANCE GOALS
The number of Performance Units that may be earned shall be determined based on the achievement of Compounded Earnings Per
Share Growth (as described below) over the Performance Period.
Compounded Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) Growth  – will be calculated based on fully diluted EPS calculated in accordance with
US GAAP  as reported in the Company’ s audited consolidated financial statements adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or , as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature. The starting point for the calculation will be adjusted EPS of $3.51 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The ending point for the calculation will be EPS for the year ended December 31, 2023, adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or , as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature.
The award scale for Compounded EPS Growth is as follows:
 
Compounded EPS Growth  
Actual
Compounded EPS
Growth   Target Award  
10.0% or more 200%
9.0%    175%  
8.0%    100%  
7.0%    25%  
< 6.0%    0%  
If actual achievement of the Performance Goal does not meet threshold performance (i.e., less than 6.0% for Compounded EPS
Growth, then that Performance Goal will be reflected in the final result for determining the number of earned Performance Units at
its assigned weighting with a 0%. The maximum award that may be earned for each Performance Goal is capped at 200%, and the
maximum award that may be earned by the Participant is capped at 200% of the Target Award.

Example:
The following is an example calculation for a Participant with a Target Award of 1,000 Performance Units:
Earnings Per Share
 
   12/31/2020   12/31/2023  
   Adjusted   Illustration  
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations   $ 3.51   $ 4.53   
         
Compounded EPS growth     8.83%
      
Earned Performance Units
   Achievement   Award    
Compounded EPS Growth    8.83%   162.5%   
     
In this example, the individual who was awarded a Target Grant of 1,000 Performance Units would earn 1,625 Performance Units
(1,000 x 1.625), which is convertible into an equivalent number of shares of Company Stock assuming all other terms and conditions
of the Grant have been satisfied.

“PSU GRANT B – EPS”
EXHIBIT  A
PERFORMANCE GOALS
The number of Performance Units that may be earned shall be determined based on the achievement of Compounded Earnings Per
Share Growth (as described below) over the Performance Period.
Compounded Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) Growth  – will be calculated based on fully diluted EPS calculated in accordance with
US GAAP  as reported in the Company’ s audited consolidated financial statements adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or , as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature. The starting point for the calculation will be adjusted EPS of $3.51 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The ending point for the calculation will be EPS for the year ended December 31, 2023, adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or , as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature.
The award scale for Compounded EPS Growth is as follows:
 
Compounded EPS Growth
Actual
Compounded EPS
Growth   Target Award
10.0% or more 200%
9.0%   175%
8.0%   100%
7.0%   25%
< 6.0%   0%
If actual achievement of the Performance Goal does not meet threshold performance (i.e., less than 6.0% for Compounded EPS
Growth, then that Performance Goal will be reflected in the final result for determining the number of earned Performance Units at
its assigned weighting with a 0%. The maximum award that may be earned for each Performance Goal is capped at
10
200%, and the maximum award that may be earned by the Participant is capped at 200% of the Target Award.
 
Example:
The following is an example calculation for a Participant with a Target Award of 1,000 Performance Units:
Earnings Per Share
 
   12/31/2020   12/31/2023
   Adjusted   Illustration
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations   $ 3.51   $ 4.53
        
Compounded EPS growth     8.83%
     
Earned Performance Units
   Achievement   Award
Compounded EPS Growth    8.83%   162.5%
   
In this example, the individual who was awarded a Target Grant of 1,000 Performance Units would earn 1,625 Performance Units
(1,000 x 1.625), which is convertible into an equivalent number of shares of Company Stock assuming all other terms and conditions
of the Grant have been satisfied.

“PSU GRANT B – EPS”
EXHIBIT  A
PERFORMANCE GOALS
The number of Performance Units that may be earned shall be determined based on the achievement of Compounded Earnings Per
Share Growth (as described below) over the Performance Period.
Compounded Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) Growth  – will be calculated based on fully diluted EPS calculated in accordance with
US GAAP  as reported in the Company’ s audited consolidated financial statements adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or , as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature. The starting point for the calculation will be adjusted EPS of $3.51 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The ending point for the calculation will be EPS for the year ended December 31, 2023, adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or , as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature.
The award scale for Compounded EPS Growth is as follows:
 
Compounded EPS Growth  
Actual
Compounded EPS
Growth   Target Award  
10.0% or more 200%
9.0%    175%  
8.0%    100%  
7.0%    25%  
< 6.0%    0%  
If actual achievement of the Performance Goal does not meet threshold performance (i.e., less than 6.0% for Compounded EPS
Growth, then that Performance Goal will be reflected in the final result for determining the number of earned Performance Units at
its assigned weighting with a 0%. The maximum award that may be earned for each Performance Goal is capped at
11
200%, and the maximum award that may be earned by the Participant is capped at 200% of the Target Award.
 
Example:
The following is an example calculation for a Participant with a Target Award of 1,000 Performance Units:
Earnings Per Share
 
   12/31/2020   12/31/2023  
   Adjusted   Illustration  
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations   $ 3.51   $ 4.53   
         
Compounded EPS growth     8.83%
      
Earned Performance Units
   Achievement   Award    
Compounded EPS Growth   8.83%   162.5%   
     
In this example, the individual who was awarded a Target Grant of 1,000 Performance Units would earn 1,625 Performance Units
(1,000 x 1.625), which is convertible into an equivalent number of shares of Company Stock assuming all other terms and conditions
of the Grant have been satisfied.

Participant, commencing on their Normal, Late, Early or Disability Retirement Date. The first payment, if any, to the Contingent
Annuitant shall be made on the first day of the calendar month coincident with or following the death of the Participant, or as soon

adjustment will be made to the benefit of a Participant whose benefit is being paid in a form described in Section 6.4(b)(ii).
(f) If a Participant’ s Contingent Annuitant is anyone other than their spouse, the present value of the payments to be
made to the Partici pant as of the date such payments are to commence, computed by using the same mortality and interest
assumptions as are used for purposes of Tables 2, 3, 4, and 4(a) must be more than 50% of the present value, as of such date and
similarly computed,  of all payments to be made to the Participant and their Contingent Annuitant. Any election of a Contingent
Annuitant made in violation of this provision shall be void.
24
(g) In the event of the death of the Participant’ s Contingent Annuitant prior to the Participant’ s actual retirement date, the
election of a Contingent Annuitant under Section 6.4 shall be inoperative.
(h) Effective January 1, 2019, a Participan t whose Annuity Starting Date occurs on or after January 1, 2019, and who
retires from  employ ment with the Employer on or after December 31, 2018, may elect to receive their vested Accrued Benefit in a
single sum payment which shall be an amount equal to the Actuarial Equivale nt present value of the Participant's vested Accrued
Benefit which would otherwise be payable at the Participant's Normal Retirement Date, excluding the value of any early retirement
subsidy .
Section 6.5    Death Benefits for Unmarried Participa nts. An unmarried Participant who is actively employed on or after
January 1, 2006 and who has completed at least five Years of Service may designate a Contingent Annuitant. The benefit to be
provided to that Contingent Annuitant shall be as specified in (a) through (c) below:
(a) For Active and Terminated Vested Parti cipants: Death Prior to Early Retiremen t Eligibility and Prior to Completing
Ten Years of Service . In the event of an unmarried Participant’ s death after they have completed five Years of Service, but before
they have become eligible for Early Retirement, whether such Participant is then actively employed or not, such Participant’ s
Contingent Annuitan t shall be entitled to a benefit, payable, if such Contingen t Annuitant is then surviving, on the first day of the
month coincident with or next following  the later of (i) the date of the Participa nt’s death or (ii) the date the Participant would have
attained age 55 had they survived. The amount of such benefit shall be the same amount that such surviving Contingent Annuitant
would have received had such Participa nt terminated their service, survived to age 55, elected the 50% contingent annuity form of
benefit, as determined under Table 2 based on their and their Contingent Annuitant’ s then attained ages, and then died.
(b) For Active Participants: Death Prior to Early Retirement Eligibility but After Ten Years of Service. In the event of an
unmarried Participan t’s death while actively employed, after they have completed ten Years of Service but prior to becoming eligible
for Early Retirement, such Participant’ s Contingent Annuitant shall be entitled to receive the same monthly benefit to which the
Participant would have been entitled had the Participant retired on the day before their death and elected to receive the 100%
contingent annuity form of benefit. The amount of such benefit shall be determined under Table 4, based on their attained age and
the attained age of their Contingent Annuitant, except that for purposes of applying Table 4, the Participant’ s attained age, if less than
age 55, shall be considered to be age 55 and their Contingent Annuitant’ s age shall be adjusted so that it bears the same relationship
to age 55 as their actual attained ages bear to each other .
(c) Death After Becoming Eligible for Early Retirement .
(i) Actively Employed Participants. In the event of an unmarried Participant’ s death, while actively employed
and after becoming eligible for Early Retirement including after the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date, such Participant’ s
Contingent Annuitant shall be entitled to receive the same monthly benefit to which the Participant
25
would have been entitled had the Participant retired on the day before death and elected to receive the 100% contingent
annuitant form of benefit as determined under Table 4, based on their attained age and the attained age of their Contingent
Annuitant.
(ii) Terminated Particip ants. In the event of an unmarried Participant’ s death after their employment with the
Employer has terminated and after becoming eligible for Early Retiremen t including after the Participant’ s Normal
Retirement Date, such Participant’ s Contingent Annuitant shall be entitled to receive the same monthly benefit to which the
Participant would have been entitled had the Participant retired on the day before death and elected to receive the 100%
contingent annuitant form of benefit as determined under Table 4, based on their attained age and the attained age of their
Contingent Annuitant.
(d) Any benefit payable under this Section 6.5 shall terminate on the surviving Contingent Annuitant’ s death.
Section 6.6    Required Distributio ns - Code Section 401(a)(9) . Distributions under this Section 6.6 shall be made in
accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the regulations thereunder , as generally described in this Section 6.6. The
provisions of this Section 6.6 shall supersede any distribution option other wise provided in the Plan to the extent that it is
inconsistent with section 401(a)(9) of the Code, but shall not create or increase any benefit. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to
the contrary , the form and the timing of all distributions under the Plan shall be in accordance with regulations issued by the
Department of the Treasury under section 401(a)(9) of the Code, including the incidental death benefit requirements of section
401(a)(9)(G) of the Code. The Plan shall apply the minimum distribution requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code in
accordance with the final regulations under section 401(a)(9) that were published on April 17, 2002 and June 15, 2004, as set forth in
Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-2 through 1.401(a)(9)-9. The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall override any provisions of the Plan to the
contrary .
(a) Time and Manner of Distribution .
(i) Required Beginning Date . The Participant’ s entire interest shall be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to
the Participant no later than the Participant’ s Required Beginning Date.
(ii) Death of Participan t Before Distributions Begin . If the Participant dies before distribu tions begin and the
Participant’ s benefic iary is entitled to receive a death benefit, the Participant’ s entire interest shall be distributed, or begin to
be distributed, no later than as follows:
(A) If the Participant’ s surviving spouse is the Participant’ s sole Designated Beneficiary , then distributions
to the surviving spouse shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year imme diately following the calendar year in
which the Participant died, or by Decem ber 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have reached age
70½, if later .
26
(B) If the Participant’ s surviving spouse is not the Participant’ s sole Designated Beneficiary , then
distributions to the Designated Beneficiary shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following
the calendar year in which the Participant died.
(C) If there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year follo wing the year of the
Participant’ s death and benefits are payable in the form of a life and certain annuity under Section 6.4(b), the
Participant’ s entire interest shall be distributed to the Participant’ s estate by the December 31 of the calendar year
containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant’ s death.
(D) If the Participant’ s surviving spouse is the Participant’ s sole Designated Benefic iary and the surviving
spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this Section 6.6(a)(ii), other
than Section 6.6(a)(ii)(A), shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.
For purposes of this Section 6.6(a)(ii) and Section 6.6(d), distributions are considered to begin on the Participant’ s Required
Beginning Date (or, if Section 6.6(a)(ii)(D) applies, the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under Section
6.6(a)(ii)(A)). If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant’ s Required Beginning Date (or to
the Participant’ s surviving spouse before  the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under Section 6.6(a)(ii)
(B)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
(iii) Form of Distribution . Unless the Participant’ s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from
an insuran ce company or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first Distribution Calendar Year
distributions shall be made in accordance with Section 6.6(b), (c) and (d). If the Participant’ s interest is distributed in the
form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company , distributions there under shall be made in accordance with the
requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the regulations thereunder .
(b) Determination of Amount to be Distributed Each Year.
(i) General Annuity Requirements . If the Participant’ s interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under
the Plan, payments under the annuity shall satisfy the following requirements:
(A) the annuity distributions shall be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year;
(B) the distribution period shall be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain not longer than the period
described in Section 6.6(c) and (d);
(C) once paym ents have begun over a period certain, the period certain shall not be changed even if the
period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted;
27
(D) payments shall either be non-increasing or increase only as follows:
(1) by an annu al percen tage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-
of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics;
(2) to the extent of the reduction in the amount of the Participant’ s payments to provide for a
survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution
period described in Section 6.6(c) dies or is no longer the Participant’ s beneficiary pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the Code;
(3) to provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the Participant’ s death; or
(4) to pay increased benefits that result from a Plan amendment.
(ii) Amount Required to be Distributed by Required Beginning Date . The amount that must be distributed on or
before the Participant’ s Required Beginning Date (or, if the Participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions
are require d to begin under Section 6.6(b)(i)) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment
need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that paym ent interval ends in the next calendar year.
Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly , monthly , semi-annually , or annually . All
of the Participant’ s benefit accruals as of the last day of the first Distribution Calendar Year shall be included in the
calculation of the amount of the annu ity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the Participant’ s Required
Beginning Date.
(iii) Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the Participant
in a calendar year after the first Distribution Calendar Year shall be distributed beginning with the first payment interval
ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.
(c) Requirements for Annuity Distributions that Commence During Participant’ s Lifetime .
(i) Joint Life Annuities Where the Beneficiary is Not the Participant’ s Spouse . If the Participant’ s interest is being
distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a non-spouse beneficiary ,
annuity payments to be made on or after the Participant’ s Required Beginning Date to the Designated Beneficiary after the
Participant’ s death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would
have been payable to the Participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-6. If the Annuity Starting
Date precedes the year in which the Participant reaches age 70, the age difference to be used in determining the applicable
percentage
28
referred to in the preceding sentence is reduced by the number of years that the Participant is younger than age 70 on their
birthday in the calen dar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor
annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a non-spouse beneficiary and a period certain annuity , the requirement in the
preceding two sentences shall apply to annuity payments to be made to the Designated Beneficiary after the expiration of the
period certain.
(ii) Period Certain Annuities . Unless the Particip ant’s spouse is the sole Designated Beneficiary and the form of
distribution is a period certain and no life annuity , the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the
Participant’ s lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the Participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table
set forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-9 for the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. If the Annuity Starting
Date prece des the year in which the Participant reaches age 70, the applicable  distribution period for the Participant is the
distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-9 plus the excess of 70
over the age of the Participant as of the Participant’ s birthday in the year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. If the
Participant’ s spouse is the Participant’ s sole Designated Beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no
life annuity , the period certain may not exceed the longer of the Participant’ s applicable distribution period, as determined
under this Section 6.6(c)(ii), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and the Participant’ s spouse as
determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant’ s and
spouse’ s attained ages as of the Particip ant’s and spouse’ s birthdays in the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting
Date.
(d) Requirements For Minimum Distributions Where Participant Dies Before Date Distributions Begin .
(i) Participant Survived  by Designated Beneficiary . If the Participant dies before the date distribution of their
interest begins and there is a Designated Beneficiary entitled to a death benefit under the Plan, the Participant’ s entire interest
will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in Section 6.6(a) (ii)(A) or (B) over the life of the Designated
Beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding:
(A) unless the Annuity Starting Date is before the first Distribution Calendar Year, the life expectancy of
the Design ated Beneficiary determined using the Designated Beneficiary’ s age as of the Designated Beneficiary’ s
birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the Participant’ s death; or
(B) if the Annuity Starting Date is before the first Distribution Calendar Year, the life expectancy of the
Designated Beneficiary determined using the Designated Beneficiary’ s age as of the Designated Beneficiary’ s
birthday in the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date.
29
(ii) No Designated Beneficiary . If the Participant dies before the date the distribution of their interest begins, the
Participant’ s surviving spouse is the Participant’ s sole Designated Beneficiary , and the surviving spouse dies before
distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this Section 6.6(d) will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant,
except that the time by which distributions must begin will be determined without regard to Section 6.6(a)(ii)(A).
(e) Definitions .
(i) Designated Benefici ary. The individual who is designated as the Contingent Annuitant under Section 2.1(i) of
the Plan and is the designated benefici ary under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4 of the

which they incur a separation from service shall include an Actuarial Equivalent adjustment to reflect the commencement of
payments after April 1 following the calendar year in which they attained age 70-½. The Actuarial Equivalent adjustment
described in the preceding sentence for any year shall reduce (but not below zero) any increase in the Participant’ s Accrued
Benefit for the year attributable to additional Years of Service for benefit accrual and Final Average Earnings.
Section 6.7    Distributions Pursua nt to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order . Any benefit payabl e to an alternate payee
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order (“QDRO”), as those terms are defined in section 414(p) of the Code, shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of the QDRO. If permitted under the terms of the QDRO, an alternate payee may elect payment of
benefits pursuant to a QDRO in the form of an Actuarially Equivalent lump sum distribution; provided, however that the alternate
payee must exercise this election within the 90-day period following the notic e to the alternate payee that the domestic relations

otherwise begun to receive their benefi t upon attainment of age 55 or current age, if older , then further reduced using the
"applicable mortality table" under section 417(e)(3) of the Code and the "applic able interest rate" under section 417(e)(3) of
the Code for the third calendar month preceding the calendar year during which the Annuity Starting Date occurs to the
extent their Annuity Starting Date precedes their Early Retirement Date.
31

married Participant of any form of distribution, other than the normal form of benefit payable to them under Section 5.8, shall be
subject to the spousal consent and notification requirements described in Section 6.2.
(f) Time of Distribution . Any single lump sum distributions elected under this Section must commence on November 1,

ARTICLE VII.
BENEFIT  PAYMENTS
Section 7.1    Purchase of Annuities . All retire ment income will be provided either through (i) the purchase of annui ties from,
or other contractual arrangements with, an Insurance Company; or (ii) by direct payment from the Trust, as determined from time to
time by the Administration Committee.
(a) In the event that a Participant, their surviving spouse, or their Contingent Annui tant is entitled to a retirement income
of less than $10 monthly , that retirement income may be paid quarterly , semi-a nnually , or annually , in amounts equal to 3, 6 or 12
times the monthly payment otherwise payable, respectively .
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , if the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum present value of a Participant’ s
vested retirement income is $5,000 or less on the date their distribution commences, such amount shall be paid to the Participant in a
single cash lump sum without the Participant’ s consent as soon as administratively feasible in accordance with the following:
(i) If the Actuarial Equivalent present value of a Participant’ s vested retirement income is $1,000 or less and the
Participant does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an “eligible  retirement plan” in accordance with Section
7.2 of the Plan, the Participant’ s retirement income shall be paid directly to the Participant in a cash lump sum.
(ii) If the Actuarial Equivalent present value of a Participant’ s vested retirement income is more than $1,000 but
does not exceed $5,000 and the Participant does not affirmatively elect to have such distribution paid directly to them or to an
“eligible retirement plan” in accordance with Section 7.2 of the Plan, the Participant’ s retirement income shall be paid
directly to an individual retirement account or annuity (an “IRA”) established for the Participant pursuant to a written
agreement between the
32
Administration Committee and the provider of the IRA that meets the requireme nts of section 401(a)(31) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder . The Administrat ion Committee shall establish and main tain procedures to inform each Participant to
whom this Section 7.1(b)(ii) applies of the nature and operation of the IRA and the Participant’ s investments therein, the fees

behalf of the Participant.
Section 7.2     Direct Rollovers .
(a) Eligibility . If one or more distributions from the Plan constitutes an “eligible rollover distribution” within the meaning
of sections 402(c)(2) and (4) of the Code, a distributee may elect to have all or a portion (but not less than $500) of the distribution
paid direc tly to an “eligible retirement plan.” As used herein, “eligible retirement plan” means an individual retirement account
described in section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity descr ibed in section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan
described in Section 403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in
section 401(a) of the Code that accepts  the distributee’ s eligible rollover distri bution. An eligible retirement plan also includes an
eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and that agrees to account separately for amounts transferred into such
plan from this Plan. For any portion of an eligible rollover distribution consistin g of after-tax contributions that are not includable in
gross income, an eligible retirement plan must agree to separately account for such portion. With respect to a distributee who is a
non-spouse beneficiary , “eligible retirement plan” means an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or
408(b) of the Code that is established on behalf of the designated beneficiary  and that will be treated as an inherited individual
retirement annuity pursuant to the provi sions of section 402(c)(1 1) of the Code. Effective for distributions made on or after January
1, 2008, a “qualified rollover contribution” as described in section 408A(e) of the Code may be made from the Plan to a Roth IRA in
a direct rollover subject to the rules and provisions set forth in section 408A(e) of the Code and any regulations issued thereunder .
The recipient may not elect to have portions of an eligible rollover distributio n paid directly to more than one eligible retirement
plan. In addition, the recipient will not be permitted to elect a direct rollover with respect to eligible rollover distributions that are
reasonably expected to total less than $200 during the year .
(b) Procedures . The Administration Committee shall make such payment upon receipt from the recipient of the name of
the eligible retirement plan to which such payment is to be made, a representat ion that the receiving plan is an “eligible retirement
plan” as defined above, and such other information and/or documentation as the Administration Committee may reasonably require
to make such payment.
(c) Failure to Elect . Except as otherwise provided under Section 7.1(b)(ii), if the recipient fails to elect whether or not a
distribution is to be paid in a direct rollover , the recipient will be deemed to have elected not to have any portion of the distribution
paid in a direct rollover .
33
(d) Application . For purposes of this Section 7.2, “distributee” means a Participant or former Participant. In addition, the
Participant’ s or former Participant’ s surviving spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic
relations order , as defined in section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.
For distributions after June 30, 2008, the term distributee also shall include a beneficiary who is not the spouse or former spouse of
the Participant or former Participant.
ARTICLE VIII.
VESTED BENEFITS IN THE EVENT  OF TERMINA TION OF EMPLOYMENT
Section 8.1    Vesting . A Participant whose employment is terminated for any reason other than death  or retirement, and who
has completed five or more Years of Service at the date of their termination of employment shall be entitled to receive a monthly
retirement income beginning on their Normal Retirement Date equal to their normal retirement income under the Plan as in effect as
of the date of their termination of employment, based on their full and partial Years of Service at such date of termination of
employment. However , if they make written application to their Employer at least two months in advance, such a Participant shall be
entitled to receive their benefit, reduced as provided in Section 5.4, beginning with the first day of any calendar month following the
month in which the sum of the years of their attained age and their completed Years of Service is at least 70, provided they have then
attained at least age 55. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, a Participant shall automatically become 100% vested on the date they reach
age 65.
Section 8.2     Payment of Vested Termination Benefit .
(a) Forms of Payment. A Participant entitl ed to benefits under Section 8.1, shall, for purposes of Section 6.1(a) and
Section 6.3, be treated as though the date on which their benefits under Sectio n 8.1 are to begin were their actual retirement date.
Such a Participant may elect any of the elective survivor benefits provided by Section 6.4.
(b) Termination Benefit For Certain Union Employees. A union Participant hired on or after January 1, 2001 but before
January 1, 2006 who terminates employment with a vested Accrued Benefit on or after January 1, 2006, may elect to receive their
benefit at any time in one of the following payment forms:
(i) a single lump sum payment in an amount equal to the Actuarial Equivalent present value of the Participant’ s
vested Accrued Benefit which would otherwise be payable at the Participant’ s Normal Retirement Date, however , if the
Participant is eligible for an Early Retirement Date at the time they terminate employment, the lump sum payment will
reflect the value of the early retirement subsidy; or
(ii) a single life annuity which shall be the Actuarial Equivalent value of the single lump sum described in (i)
above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if payment to the Participant occurred later than the close of the second Plan Year following the Plan
Year in which such termination of employment occurred and such Participant is reemployed by the Employer , the Participant’ s
Accrued Benefit shall be
34
restored upon reemp loyment without the requirement that they make restoratio n contributions, provided, however their subsequent
Accrued Benefit, if any, payable upon their subsequent termination of employment shall be offset by the Accrued Benefit attributable
to the prior distribution.
Section 8.3    Failure to Vest. A Participant whos e employment is terminated for any reason other than death or retirement and
who has not completed at least five Years of Service at the time of their termina tion of employment for any reason other than death
or retirement shall not be entitled to any benefits under the Plan. Amounts forfeited under this provision shall be applied to reduce
the obligation of the Company and its Designated Subsidiaries to contribute under the Plan.
ARTICLE IX.
RE-EMPLOYMENT  AND BREAKS-IN-SER VICE
Section 9.1    Re-employment before July 1, 1976 . If a Participant who terminated employment with the Employer is re-
employed before July 1, 1976, they shall be considered a new Employee for purposes of this Plan. In determining the amount of their
retirement income as a new Employee, however , if the Participant has vested retirement income benefits under Section 8.1 due to
prior service, their benefit shall be computed under Section 5.2 as if their service was continuous. The benefit payable to such
Participant as a new Employee shall be the excess of the benefit so compute d over the benefit payable on account of that prior
service, without regard to any actuarial reductions to which that prior service benefit may have been subject.
Section 9.2    Re-employment after June 30, 1976 and before July 1, 1985 . If a Parti cipant terminates employmen t with the
Employer and is re-employed after June 30, 1976 and before July 1, 1985, all of their Years of Service shall be recognized for all
purposes of the Plan unless, at the time of their return to employment, the period of their absence was at least a one-year Break-in-
Service, in which event:
(a) Years of Service occurring before the Break-in-Service shall not thereafter be recognized for any purpose of the Plan
unless, immediately following the Break-in-Service, they completed one Year of Service; and,
(b) if, before the Break-in-Service, the Participant had no vested retirement income benefit under Section 8.1, Years of

writing, and (ii) receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other

available under the terms of the Plan is not available to a Participant or benef iciary as of the annuity starting date because of the
application of the requirements of this Section 17.1(a), the Participant or benefic iary is permitted to elect to bifurcate the benefit into
unrestricted and restricted portions (as described in section 1.436-1(d)(3)(iii)(D) of the Treasury Regulations). The Participant or
beneficiary may also elect any other optional form of benefit otherwise availa ble under the Plan at that annuity starting date that
would satisfy the 50%/PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount limitation described in this Section 17.1(a), or may elect to defer
the benefit in accordance with any general right to defer commencement of benefits under the Plan.
During a period when Section 17.1(a) applies to the Plan, Participants and benef iciaries are permitted to elect payment in any
optional form of benefit otherwise available under the Plan that provides for the current payment of the unrestricted portion of the
benefit (as described in section 1.436-1(d)(3)(iii)(D) of the Treasury Regulations), with a delayed commencement for the restricted
portion of the benefit (subject to other applicable qualification requirements, such as sections 41 1(a)(1 1) and 401(a)(9) of the Code).
(b) Plan Amendments Increasing Liability for Benefits . No amendment to the Plan that has the effect of increasing
liabilities of the Plan by reason of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accrual, or
changing the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable shall take effect in a Plan Year if the adjusted funding target attainment
percentage for the Plan Year is:
(i)     Less than 80%; or
(ii)     80% or more, but would be less than 80% if the benefits attributable to the amendment were taken into
account in determining the adjusted funding tar get attainment percentage.
The limitation set forth in this Section 17.1(b) does not apply to any amendmen t to the Plan that provides a benefit increase
under a Plan form ula that is not based on compensation, provided that the rate of such increase does not exceed the
contemporaneous rate of increase in the average wages of Participants covered by the amendment.
Section 17.2    Limitations Applicable If the Plan's Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage Is Less Than 60%.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, if the Plan's adjusted funding  target attainment percentage for a Plan Year is less
than 60% (or would  be less than 60% to the extent described in Section 17.2(b) below), then the limitations in this Section 17.2
apply .
47
(a) Single Sums, Other Accelerated Forms of Distribution, and Other Prohibited Payments Not Permitted . A Participant
or beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a single sum payment or other optional form of benefit that
includes a prohibited payment with an annuity starting date on or after the applicable section 436 measurement date, and the Plan
shall not make any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or any other payment or
transfer that is a prohibited payment. The limitation set forth in this Section 17.2(a) does not apply to any payment of a benefit which
under Section 41 1(a)(1 1) of the Code may be immediately distributed without the consent of the Participant.
(b) Shutdown Benefits and Other Unpredic table Contingent Event Benefits Not Permitted to Be Paid. An unpredictable
contingent event benefit with respect to an unpredictable contingent event occurring during a Plan Year shall not be paid if the
adjusted funding tar get attainment percentage for the Plan Year is:
(i) Less than 60%; or
(ii) 60% or more, but would be less than 60% if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage were
redetermined applyi ng an actuarial assumption that the likelihood of occurrence  of the unpredictable contingent event during
the Plan Year is 100%.
(c) Benefit Accruals Frozen. Benefit accruals under the Plan shall cease as of the applicable section 436 measurement
date. In addition, if the Plan is required  to cease benefit accruals under this Section 17.2(c), then the Plan is not permitted to be
amended in a mann er that would increase the liabilities of the Plan by reason  of an increase in benefits or establishment of new
benefits.
Section 17.3    Limitations Applicable If the Plan Sponsor Is In Bankruptcy . Notwithstanding any other provisions of the
Plan, a Participant or beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a single sum payment or other optional form of
benefit that includes a prohibited payme nt with an annuity starting date that occurs during any period in which the Plan sponsor is a
debtor in a case under title 11, United States Code, or similar Federal or State law, except for payments made within a Plan Year with
an annuity starting date that occurs on or after the date on which the Plan's enrolled actuary certifies that the Plan's adjusted funding
target attainment percentage for that Plan Year is not less than 100%. In addition, during such period in which the Plan sponsor is a
debtor , the Plan shall not make any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable  commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or any
other payment or transfer that is a prohib ited payment, except for payments that occur on a date within a Plan Year that is on or after
the date on which the Plan's enrolled actuary certifies that the Plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for that Plan Year
is not less than 100%. The limitation set forth in this Section 17.3 does not apply to any payment of a benefit which under section
411(a)(1 1) of the Code may be immediately distributed without the consent of the Participant.
48
Section 17.4     Provisions Applicable After Limitations Cease to Apply .
(a) Resumption of Prohibited Payments . If a limitation on prohibited payments under Section 17.1(a), Section 17.2(a), or
Section 17.3 applied to the Plan as of a section 436 measurement date, but that limit no longer applies to the Plan as of a later section
436 measurement date, then that limitation does not apply to benefits with annuity starting dates that are on or after that later section
436 measurement date.
In addition, after the section 436 measu rement date on which the limitation on prohibited payments under Section 17.1(a) or
17.2(a) ceases to apply to the Plan, any Participant or beneficiary who had an annuity starting date within the period during which
that limitation applied to the Plan is permitted to make a new election (within 90 days after the section 436 measurement date on
which the limit ceases to apply or, if later, 30 days after receiving notice of the right to make such election) under which the form of
benefit previously elected is modified at a new annuity starting date to be chang ed to a single sum payment for the remaining value
of the Participant or beneficiary's benefit under the Plan, subject to the other rules in this Article XVII and applicable requirements
of section 401(a) the Code, including spousal consent.
(b) Resumption of Benefit Accruals . If a limit ation on benefit accruals unde r Section 17.2(c) applied to the Plan as of a
section 436 measurement date, but that limitation no longer applies to the Plan as of a later section 436 measurement date, then
benefit accruals shall resume prospectiv ely and that limitation does not apply to benefit accruals that are based on service on or after
that later section 436 measurement date, except as otherwise provided under the Plan. The Plan shall comply with the rules relating
to partial years of participation and the prohibition on double proration unde r Department of Labor regulation 29 CFR section
2530.204-2(c) and (d).
In addition, benefit accruals that were not permitted to accrue because of the application of Section 17.2(c) shall be restored
when that limitation ceases to apply if the continuous period of the limitation was 12 months or less and the Plan's enrolled actuary
certifies that the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year would not be less than 60% taking into account any
restored benefit accruals for the prior Plan Year.
(c) Shutdown and Other Unpredictable Contingent Event Benefits . If an unpredictable contingent event benefit with
respect to an unpred ictable contingent event that occurs during the Plan Year is not permitted to be paid after the occurrence of the
event because of the limitation of Secti on 17.2(b), but is permitted to be paid later in the same Plan Year (as a result of additional
contributions or pursuant to the enrolled  actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year
that meets  the requirements of section 1.436-1(g)(5)(ii)(B) of the Treasury Regulations), then that unpredictable contingent event
benefit shall be paid, retroactive to the period that benefit would have been payable under the terms of the Plan (determined without
regard to Section 17.2(b)). If the unpred ictable contingent event benefit does not become payable during the Plan Year in accordance
with the preceding sentence, then the Plan is treated as if it does not provide for that benefit.
(d) Treatment of Plan Amendments That Do Not Take Effect. If a Plan amendment does not take effect as of the effective
date of the amendment because of the limitation of Section
49
17.2(b) or Section 17.2(c), but is perm itted to take effect later in the same Plan Year (as a result of additional contributions or
pursuant to the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year that meets the
requirements of section 1.436-1(g)(5)(ii)(C) of the Treasury Regulations), then the Plan amendment must automatically take effect as
of the first day of the Plan Year (or, if later, the original effective date of the amendment). If the Plan amendment cannot take effect
during the same Plan Year, then it shall be treated as if it were never adopted, unless the Plan amendment provides otherwise.
Section 17.5    Notice Requirement . See section 101(j)  of ERISA  for rules requiring the plan administrator of a single
employer defined benefit pension plan to provide a written notice to particip ants and beneficiaries within 30 days after certain
specified dates if the plan has become subject to a limitation described in Section 17.1(a), Section 17.2, or Section 17.3.
Section 17.6    Methods to Avoid or Terminate Benefit Limitations . See section 436(b)(2), (c)(2), (e)(2), and (f) of the Code
and section 1.436-1(f) of the Treasury  Regulations for rules relating to employer contributions and other methods to avoid or
terminate the application of the limitati ons set forth in Sections 17.1 through 17.3 for a Plan Year. In general, the methods a plan
sponsor may use to avoid or terminate one or more of the benefit limitations under Sections 17.1 through 17.3 for a Plan Year
include employer contributions and elections to increase the amount of plan assets which are taken into account in determining the
adjusted funding target attainment percentage, making an employer contribution that is specifically designated as a current year
contribution that is made to avoid or terminate application of certain of the benefit limitations, or providing security to the plan.

(within the meaning of section 410(b) of the Code) no Key Employee or former Key Employee.
C.    Limitations on Benefits - Code Section 415 Limit .
C.1    Effective for Limitation Years ending after December 31, 2001, in no case shall the annual benefit with respect to any
Participant payable under the Plan and all other Defined Benefit Plans, when expressed in the form of an annual single life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits), exceed the “maximum permissible benefit” which  shall be the lesser of the amount determined under
Paragraph C.1.1 or C.1.2 (both adjusted where required, as provided in Paragraph C.1.3, and, if applicable, in Paragraph C.1.4 or
Paragraph C.1.5):
C.1.1    the dollar limitation specified in section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code,  as in effect for the Limitation Year
($215,000 for 2017), as adjusted, effective January 1 of each year under section 415(d) of the Code in such manner as the
Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe (the “Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation”)); or
C.1.2    the greater of $10,000 or 100%  of the Participant’ s average annual Compensation received during the three
consecutive years of Continuous Service  (years of participation in the Plan for Limitation Years beginning before January 1,
2006) with the Employer and all 50% related employers during which they receive the greatest aggregate annual
Compensation. The $10,000 restriction  shall not apply if the Participant participates in any defined contribution plan
maintained by the Employer , a 50% related employer or a predecessor employ er. For purposes of determining the $10,000
amount, the benefit payable to the Participant under the Plan for a Limitation Year reflects all amounts payable under the
Plan for the Limitat ion Year (except as otherwise provided in Treas. Reg. § 1.415(d)-1) and are not adjusted for faun of
benefit or commencement date.
C.1.3    If the Participant has fewer than 10 years of participation in the Plan, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation
shall be multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the
Plan and (ii) the
APP-2-5
denominator of which is 10. In the case of a Participant who has fewer than 10 Years of Service with the Employer , the
Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part
thereof) of service with the Employer and (ii) the denominator of which is 10.
C.1.4    If the benefit of a Participant begins prior to age 62, the Defined Bene fit Dollar Limitation applicable to the
Participant at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age
that is the Actuarial  Equivalent of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable to the Participant at age 62 (adjusted
under Paragraph C.1.3 above, if required). The Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable at an age prior to age 62 is
determined as the lesser of (i) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the Defin ed Benefit Dollar Limitation computed using
the interes t rate provided under Section 2.1(b), or (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the Defined Benefit Dollar
Limitation compute d using a 5 percent interest rate. Any decrease in the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation determined in
accordance with this Paragraph C.1.4 shall not reflect a mortality decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the
Participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account.
Effective for Limitation Years beginning on and after July 1, 2007, the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age
prior to age 62 is determined as the lesse r of (1) the actuarial equivalent at such age of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed
using a 5% interest rate and the applic able mortality table under section 417(e)(3) of the Code, or (2) the amount determined by
multiplying the defined benefit dollar limitation by the ratio of the annual amount of the single life annuity beginning at such earlier
age (comp uted using the interest rate and mortality table as applicable under Section 2.1(b)) to the annual amount of the single life
annuity under the Plan commencing at age 62 (with both such amounts determin ed without application of the rules of section 415 of
the Code).
C.1.5    If the benefit of a Participant  begins after the Participant attains age 65, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation
applicable to the Participant at the later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the later
age that is Actuarially Equivalent to the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable to the Participant at age 65 (adjusted under
Paragraph C.1.3 above, if required). The Actuarial Equivalent of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable at an age after age
65 is determined as the lesser of (i) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation computed using
the interes t rate provided under Section 2.1(b), or (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation
computed using a 5 percent interest rate. For these purposes, mortality between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence shall
be ignored.
Effective for Limitation Years beginning on and after July 1, 2007, for benefits commencing after age 65, the dollar
limitation shall be determined as the lesser of (1) the actuarial equivalent at such age of the defined benefit dollar limitation
computed using an interest rate of 5% and the applicable mortality table descr ibed under section 417(e)(3) of the Code, or (2) the
amount determined by multiplying the defined benefit dollar limitation by the ratio of (A) the annual amount of the single life
annuity beginning at such later age (computed using the interest rate and mortali ty assumptions for delayed retirement benefits under
the Plan,
APP-2-6
if applicab le) to (B) the annual amount of the single life annuity under the Plan commencing at age 65 (computed without using the
interest rate and mortality assumptions for delayed retirement benefits under the Plan, if applicable) (with both such amounts in (A)
and (B) determined without application  of the rules of section 415 of the Code). The amount of the annual benefit commencing at
such later age is the annual amount of the benefit (determined without regard to section 415 of the Code) computed by disregarding
the Participant’ s accruals after age 65, but including actuarial adjustments even if such adjustments are applied to offset benefit
accrual.
C.1.6    Benefit increases resulting from the increase in the limitations of sectio n 415(b) of the Code shall be provided to all
Participants with benefits limited by section 415(b) of the Code who, (i) as of January 1, 2002 have commenced receipt of their
benefit under the Plan; or (ii) are credited with at least one Hour of Service on or after January 1, 2002.
C.1.7    If a Participant’ s benefit is payable in any form other than a straight life annuity , the determination as to whether the
limitation of this Paragraph C.1 has been satisfied shall be made by adjusting such benefit to the form of a straight life annuity using
an interest rate equal to the greater of 5% or the interest rate provided under Section 2.1(b). However , for purposes of such
adjustment, any ancillary benefit that is not directly related to retirement income benefits and that portion of any joint and survivor
annuity that constitu tes a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity shall not be taken into account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
purposes of adjustin g any form of benefit subject to the requirements of section 417(e)(3) of the Code, the interest rate used shall not
be less than the greater of (i) the applicable interest rate under section 417(e)(3)  of the Code for the October immediately preceding
the calend ar year during which the Annuity Starting Date occurs, provided that the lump sum present value for distributions made on
or before October 1, 2007, shall not be less than the lump sum present value  based on the applicable interest rate under section
417(e)(3) of the Code for the third calendar month preceding the calendar month in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs, or (ii)
the interest rate specified in Section 2.1(b).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary , for purposes of adjusting any form of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3) of
the Code for Plan Years beginning in 2004 or 2005, the interest rate used shall not be less than the greater of (i) 5.5%, or (ii) the
interest rate specified in Section 2.1(b).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for Limitation Years beginning on and after July 1, 2007, for purposes of applying
the limitations under this Article C, if a Participant’ s benefits are payable in a form of benefit other than a single life annuity or a
qualified joint and survivor annuity , the benefit shall be limited as follows. The benefit shall be converted to a single life annuity
using the interest rate and mortality assumptions specified in the Plan for the Actuarial Equivalent of the particular form of benefit
payable. The single life annuity , which has been so determined, shall be comp ared to the single life annuity computed using a 5%
interest rate assumption (or for any form  of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Code, the applicable interest rate as defined in
section 417(e)(3) of the Code) and the IRS mortality table prescribed in sectio n 415(b)(2)(E)(v) of the Code). The greater of these
two amounts shall be the applicable limit for the benefit payable in a form other than a single life annuity or a qualified joint and
survivor annuity .
APP-2-7
Effective as of January 1, 2006, if a Participant’ s benefit is payable in a form subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Code, such
benefit shall be adjusted, for purposes of applying the limitations under this Article C, so that it is the greater of (1) a straight life
annuity determined using the interest rate and mortality table as applicable under Section 2.1(b), (2) a straight life annuity
determined using an interest rate of 5.5% and the applicable mortality table described under section 417(e)(3) of the Code, or (3) a
straight life annuity determined using the interest rate that produces a benefit of not more than 105% of the benefit that would be
produced using the applicable interest rate and applicable mortality table described under section 417(e)(3) of the Code.
C.2    Applicable Mortality Table for Distributions With Annuity Starting Dates on or after December 31, 2002 .
Notwithstanding any other Plan provisio ns to the contrary , the applicable mortality table used for purposes of adjusting any benefit
or limitatio n under section 415(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D) of the Code as set forth in this Article C (unless another mortality table is either
required under section 415(b) of the Code or otherwise referenced in this Article C) is the table prescribed in Rev. Rul. 2007-67 for
Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2007 (Rev . Rul. 2001-62 for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2008), or such other
table as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.
C.3    Definition of Compensation . For purposes of this Article C, Compensation shall include all amounts that are treated as
wages for Federal income tax withholding under section 3401(a) of the Code (determined without regard to any rules that limit the
remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed) and actually paid to
the Participant during the Limitation Year, plus amounts that would be paid to the Employee during the year but for the Employee’ s
election under a cash or deferred arrangement described in section 401(k) of the Code, a cafeteria plan described in section 125 of
the Code, a qualified transportation fring e benefit program described in section 132(f)(4) of the Code, a simplified employee pension

sentence shall not be considered Compensation if paid after separation from service, even if they are paid by the later of 2½ months
after the date of separation from service or the end of the Limitation Year that includes the date of severance from employment.
C.4    Application of the provisions of this Section C of this Appendix 2 in effect for Limitation Years beginning on and after
July 1, 2007, shall not cause the maximum permissible benefit for any Particip ant to be less than the Participant’ s accrued benefit
under all the defined  benefit plans of the Employer or a predecessor employer  as of the end of the last Limitation Year beginning
before July 1, 2007 under provisions of the plans that were both adopted and in effect before April 5, 2007 determined in accordance
