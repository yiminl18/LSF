General
 
Verizon Com munications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of
communications, inform ation and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world,
we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable
network connectivity , security and control. Forme rly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation, we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware.
We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corpo ration. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately
177,700 employees.
Our principal executive of fices are located at 1095 A venue of the Americas, New Y ork, New Y ork 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000).
We have two reportable segments, W ireless and W ireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and or ganize by products and services.
 
Wireless    
 Wireless’ communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer ,
business and government customers across the United States.
Wireline
 Wireline’ s voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data, corporate networking
solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these

 • “Segment Results of Operations” on pages 19 through 24 and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 71 through 73.
 
Wireless
 
Backgr ound
Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the
United State s (U.S.). Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the U.S. as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2015,
Verizon Wireless had 112.1 million retail connections and 2015 revenues of approximately $91.7 billion, representing approximately 70% of Verizon’ s aggregate
revenues.
Verizon Wireless was formed as a joint venture in April 2000 by the combination of the U.S. wirel ess operations and interests of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc
(Vodafone). On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vodafone and Vodafone 4 Limited, pursuant to which Verizon agreed to
acquire all of Vodafone’ s indirect 45% interest in Verizon Wireless for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion (the Wireless Transaction). We
completed the Wireless Transaction on Februar y 21, 2014 and, as a result, we acquired 100% ownership of Verizon Wireless. The consideration paid was
primarily comprised of cash and V erizon common stock.
We have the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-T erm Evolution (LTE) technology and third-gen eration (3G) Evolution - Data Optimized (EV-DO) networks of
any U.S. wireless service provider . Our 4G LTE network is available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately
312 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural
areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier ’s network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C Block and
Advanced W ireless Services (A WS) spectrum.
We are focusing our wireless capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE netw ork. In 2015, we announced our commitment to developing and
deploying fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology . We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and
appropriate requirements for this next generation of wireless technology .

Wireless Service and Pr oduct Offerings
Our wireless services are available to our custom ers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, customers can obtain wireless products and
services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis.
Wireless Services
We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon
Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services.  A single account may include monthly wireless services for a
variety of connected devices. A postpaid retail connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is billed in advance a
monthly access charge in return for a monthly network service allowance, and usage beyond the allowance is billed in arrears. Approximately 95% of our retail
connections received our wireless services on a postpaid basis as of December 31, 2015. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services
without credit verification by paying for all services in advance.
We offer various postpai d account service plans, including shared data plans, single connection plans and plans tailored to the needs of our business customers.
Our shared data plans feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited domestic and interna tional text, video and picture messaging, cloud storage and a
single data allowance that can be shared among up to 10 devices on a customer ’s account. For an additional monthly access fee, our customers have the option of
sharing long distance and roaming minutes among their devices for calls from the United States to, and calls while within, Canada and Mexico. Shared data plans
also include our Mobile Hotspot service at no additional char ge. This service enables a customer to activate a personal W i-Fi hotspot via their smartphone that can
provide Internet access to multiple W i-Fi enabled devices. W e also of fer various voice and shared data plans for small and lar ge businesses.
Customers on our fixed-term service plans have historically paid higher fees for their wireless service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless
devices at subsidized prices. Under the Verizon device payment program (formerly known as Verizon Edge), our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or
tablets at unsubsidized prices on an installment basis (a device installment plan). Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment
program or on a compati ble device that they already own pay lower service fees (unsubsidized service pricing) as compared to those under our fixed-term service
plans. Generally , customers entering into device  installment agreements on or after June 1, 2015 are required to repay all amounts due under their device
installment agreement before being eligible to upgrade their device. However , certain devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new
device after paying down the minimum percentage of their device installment plan and trading in their device.
In August 2015, we launched a simplified shared  data plan, the Verizon Plan, that offers customers various sizes of data packages that can be shared among up to
10 devices on a customer ’s account. New customers who wish to participate in this new plan can do so by purchasing a device from Verizon either under our
device paym ent program  or at full retail, or by using their own compatible device. In addition, our current customers have the option of either moving to the
Verizon Plan, subject to certain restrictions, or keeping their existing plan.
We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of our devices. Our messaging services enable our customers to send and
receive text, picture and video messages. In addit ion, access to the Internet is available on all of our smartphones and nearly all of our basic phones. We also offer
service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebo ok computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or
3G EV-DO modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as USB modems, Jetpacks  and other dedicated
devices that provide a mobile W i-Fi connection.
Our custome rs can access multimedia offerings, provided by Verizon and by third parties, consisting of applications providing music, video, gaming, news and
other content. Our busin ess-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity , include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet, their
corporate intranets and e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. Our location-b ased services provide our customers with directions to their
destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our global data services allow our customers
to access data services and the Internet on all of our smartphones and many of our tablets and basic phones from hundreds of international destinations. In
addition, depending upon their wireless device’ s operating system, our customers have access to more than one million applications and services offered by
Google Inc. (Google) via Google Play, Apple Inc. (Apple) via iTunes, Microsoft Inc. (Microso ft) via its Windows Phone operating system and BlackBerry
Limited (BlackBerry) via its BlackBerry App W orld webstore.
Our customers can make  and receive calls on their home phone handsets using our wireless netw ork through our Home Phone Connect service or Verizon 4G
LTE Broadb and Router with Voice service. We also offer LTE Internet (Installed), a high-speed Internet service that provides customers with Internet connections
in their homes using our 4G L TE network.
In addition, we provide network access and, in some cases, enhanced value added services to support wireless connections for the Internet of Things (IoT). Our
IoT services support devices that are used by a variety of vertical market segments, including health monitoring, education, manufacturing, utilities, distribution
and consume r products. For example, companies purchase network access and, in some cases, enhanced services from us in order to connect with and monitor
equipment, such as medical devices used to monitor patients, fleet management devices used to monitor company-operated vehicles and utility monitoring
devices used for smart grid applications. Other companies purchase network access from us to support devices that are included in a service they, in turn, sell to
end users. We also support telematics services for some of the largest automotive manufacturers. We expect that consumer use of IoT wireless connections, such
as telematics , home monitoring, health monitorin g, energy management and utilities managemen t, will increase as consumers integrate these devices into their
mobile lifestyle. (See “New Product Development and Strategic Initiatives.”)

Wireless Devices
We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices.
Smartphones and Basic Phones . All of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO high-speed data services and run on various
operating platforms, such as Apple iOS, Google Android, Windows Phone OS, and BlackBerry OS. Most of the basic phones we offer are 3G EV-DO-enabled
and have HTML-browsing capability .
Tablets and Other Internet Devices.  We offer tablets from multiple manufacturers, all of which can access the Internet via our 4G LTE network or a Wi-Fi
connection. The tablets run primarily on the Apple iOS, Google Android or Microsoft Windows operating systems. In addition, we offer dedicated devices, which
we refer to as Jetpacks that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection and are capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the
Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the
use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO Mobile Broadband modules. During 2015, we continued to experience
strong customer demand for tablets and the percentage of our retail postpaid connection base represented by connections to these devices continued to increase.
We purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from Apple, Motorola Mobility , Samsung, LG Electronics, BlackBerry and HTC.
A key compo nent of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the “intelligence” of the device. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled devices are
manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset technology . To support CDMA-1XR TT and EV-DO technologies (with and without 4G
LTE), most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on Qualcomm Incorporated for the manufacture and supply of chipsets. In addition, there are a number
of other components common to wireless devices provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly .
Network
We have the largest 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO networks of any service provider in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most
populous U.S. metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2015, our 4G LTE network covered approximately 312 million people in the U.S., including those in areas
served by our LTE in Rural America partners. We currently have 21 committed program partic ipants that have the potential to provide 4G LTE coverage to
approximately three million people and, to date, all participants have commenced 4G L TE operations on their networks.
The reliabili ty of our wireless network is a key factor for our continued success, and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for
their wireless services. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that
will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage.
We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, and completions of
large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt
and completed without being dropped. We plan to continue to upgrade our network, primarily  to increase its capacity and density , by utilizing small cell
technology , in-building solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existin g AWS spectrum. We are also exploring strategic opportunities
to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses.
Our network  includes various elements of redun dancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our
operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every
switch location. In additi on, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a
fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in all critical locations.
In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless
service in nearly all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to
our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the Unite d States. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated
at-will by either party upon several months’ notice; however , we do not believe that the termina tion of any of these at-will agreements would have a material
adverse ef fect on our business.
Technology
Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). 4G LTE provides higher data throughput performance
for data services at a lower cost compared to that of fered by 3G technologies.

Table of Contents
In 2014, we commercial ly launched our mobile Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service known as Voice over LTE (VoLTE). Advanced Calling 1.0, a first
generation suite of services enabled by V oLTE, is now being used, in addition to CDMA technology , to provide voice calling services to our customers.
In 2015, we announced our commitment to devel oping and deploying 5G wireless technology . We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry
partners to develop 5G requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introdu ction of 5G technologies. We believe that 5G technology will
provide higher throughpu t than the current 4G LTE technology , lower latency and the ability to handle more network traffic as the number of Internet-connected
devices grows. W e plan to launch field technology trials in 2016.
Spectrum
The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide these wireless services on
portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum,
portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively , cover nearly all of the population of the
United States.
In January 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band. We participated in that
auction, and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approxima tely $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses
in April 2015.
We anticipat e we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and usage of
wireless broadband services, which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive. We can meet our future spectrum needs by
acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions
occur . The FCC will be auctioning television broadcast spectrum in the 600 MHz frequency range through a voluntary incentive auction that will take place in
two phases. In the first phase, television broadcasters participating in the auction process will “sell” their rights to use such spectrum to the FCC. In the second
phase, the FCC will “resell” that spectrum to various auction participants, including wireless service providers and other potential bidders. The incentive auction
is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016.
Since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain  markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others, from time
to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar
opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. In other cases, we have entered into intra-
market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves
network performance and efficiency . These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum
licenses in each instance.
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions.
Network Equipment and Build-out
Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells. Our primary
CDMA cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Alcatel-Lucent, which provides more than half of our CDMA cell site equipment, and Nokia Solutions and
Networks (NSN) and Ericsson, which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely on Alcatel-Lucent, NSN and Ericsson for our
switching equipment. In January 2016, Nokia Corporation acquired Alcatel-Lucent and combined operations.
As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps,  including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as
obtaining zoning, other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for macro cell sites. As we densify our network, we follow a similar process for small cells, in-
building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown
Castle International Corp. and American T ower Corporation (American T ower), as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites.
During Marc h 2015, we completed a transaction  with American Tower pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate
approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American Tower has exclusive
rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to
acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms.  As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1
billion. W e have subleased capacity on the towers from American T ower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew .
Marketing and Distribution
Our marketi ng strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our
extensive distribution network; and jointly mark eting our products and services to large business and government customers with Verizon’ s Wireline business
units through  the Wireless Business Group, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizon Wireless’ solutions for medium and large business
and governm ent custom ers. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media
promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution
channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs.
 
6
Table of Contents
Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy . We have opened Verizon Destination Stores in various major metropolitan areas,
which focus  on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. These stores are part of a broader
initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into “Smart Stores,” which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones on a smaller scale. In
addition, our direct channel includes our business-to-business sales operations and system s organization and is focused on supporting the wireless
communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. In addition, we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling
incoming calls from customers, and we of fer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless devices, accessories and service plans.
Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as
through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with
us. We also utilize high-p rofile, national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Stores
such as Dollar General and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry . We compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc. (AT&T), Sprint Corporation and
T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile USA), as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk
wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including those that buy from us. Competition is intense as a result of continuing
increases in wireless market penetration levels, network investment by our competitors, the develo pment and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of
new product s and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licen sed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may
also increase as smaller , stand-alone wireless service providers mer ge or transfer licenses to lar ger, better capitalized wireless service providers.
The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology comp anies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture
customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft,
Google, Apple and other s are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider ’s voice
service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content.
We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry:
 
• Network reliability , capacity and coverage.  We believe  that a wireless network that consistently provides high quality and reliable service is a key
differentiator in the U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved servic e quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many
cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity . In order to compete
effectively , wireless service providers must keep  pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We
believe that our investments in our 4G L TE network to increase network capacity will enable us to meet customer demand.
 
• Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important  role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow ,
wireless service providers are offering service plans that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying
megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage at competitive prices. Some wireless service providers also allow customers to rollover
unused data allowances to the next billing period. Furthermore, some wireless service providers offer price plans to new customers that undercut pricing under
the customer ’s service plan with its current wirel ess provider , and some wireless service providers have bundled wireless service offers with other products.
Some wireless providers also of fer promotional pricing and incentives tar geted specifically to customers of V erizon W ireless.
Many wirele ss service providers, as well as equip ment manufacturers, offer device payment options that decouple service pricing from equipment pricing and
blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device installment plans, which provide customers with the
ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically , wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans
whereby , in exchange for the customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wirele ss service providers significantly , and in some cases fully,
subsidized the customer ’s device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers
on device installment plans. We and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued the use of device subsidies. As a result of the increased
penetration of device installment plans, we expe ct the number of customers on plans with unsubsidized service pricing to continue to grow in 2016. We
compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price, while meeting
their wireless service needs.
 
• Customer service. We believe that high-qua lity customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting  new customers, including those of other
wireless providers. Our customer service, retentio n and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and
services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of
customer service and are also focused on improving in this area.  As part of our ef forts to promote

long-term relationships with our customers, we offer Verizon Smart Rewards, which is a program that offers a wide variety of rewards to customers in
exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related interactions with Verizon Wireless. The program offers customers discounts and savings
on merchandise from well-known brands, as well as discounts and other of fers at local shopping and dining venues.
 
• Product and service development. As wireless technologies  develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will
be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment
of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers. We also collaborate with
various device manufacturers in the development  of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications
and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smar tphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our
customer base.
 
• Sales and distribution. Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that
attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability , as measured by operating income.
We endeavo r to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities,
our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of laptops and netbooks with
embedded 4G LTE and 3G modules that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional
resellers, which resell network services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their IoT devices or for their
provision of telematics services.
 
• Capital r esour ces. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require
significant capital resources. W e generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors.
Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors af fecting the wireless industry , including the factors described above, as well as
new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of
competitors.
 
Wireline
Backgr ound
Our W ireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, including broadband video and data, corporate networking
solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and
services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world. In 2015,
Wireline revenues were $37.7 billion, representing approximately 29% of V erizon’ s aggregate revenues.
In 2014, our Wireline segment sold a non-strat egic business that provides communications solutions to a variety of government agencies. Accordingly , the
historical Wireline resul ts for these operations, which were not material to our consolidated financial statements or segment results of operations, have been
reclassified to Corporate and other to reflect comparable segment operating results.
On February  5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which
Verizon will sell its local  exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched
and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.5
billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from V erizon by Frontier . The transaction,
which includes the acqui sition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, does
not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently included in Verizon’ s continuing operations and
classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The transaction is subject
to the satisf action of certain closing conditions including, among others, receipt of federal approvals from the FCC and the antitrust authorities and state
regulatory approvals. All federal and state regulatory approvals have been obtained. W e expect this transaction to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Based on the number of voice connections and Fios Internet and video subscribers, respectively , as of December 31, 2015, the transaction would result in Frontier
acquiring approximately  3.4 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses
from V erizon.

other carriers  that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2015, Global Wholesa le revenues were $6.0 billion, representing approximately 16%
of Wireline’ s aggregate revenues. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete
directly with us.
Global Wholesale provides the following services, which it jointly markets with V erizon’ s other business units through V erizon Enterprise Solutions:
 
 • Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our whol esale customers’ networks and provide
connections to their end-users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Wavelength services, as
well as core data circuits , such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated
local exchange capacity to support their private networks.
New Ethernet connectivity in the U.S. represents  the largest data growth opportunity in wholesale , as customers anticipate higher capacity demands in
the future. These custom ers are also migrating networks from time division multiplexing (TDM) to Ethernet, which will better scale and service the
growth of broadband services driven by smartphones, mobile broadband and mobile video. Global Wholesale offers a complete suite of services to
support the expansion of 4G and 3G networks.
Data services also include certain value-added business services, which leverage many of the same of ferings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio,

Network
To provide services to our customers, we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world.
 
 • Fios. Our fiber-to-the-home network through which we provide our Fios residential broadband service has passed over 20.5 million premises in the U.S. as
of Decembe r 31, 2015. Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that
demand will continue to grow . The continued emer gence of new video services, new data applicat ions, and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will
continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We belie ve that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology
underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost effective and efficient manner . Our PON technology provides the flexibility to
adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services without major overhauls or replacements to the fiber optic infrastructure. While
deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, the PON infrastructure is finding incre ased application in the enterprise sector , especially as
businesses seek to migrate to Ethernet-based access services.
 
 • Global IP . Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150
countries and 2,700 cities. Our global IP network includes long haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 800,000 route miles and enable and support
far reaching international operations.
Global IP volume has increased significantly over the last five years and substantial year-over -year growth is expected to continue. We deployed the
industry’ s first 100G ultra-long-haul-system for live traffic in 2009, and have made additional 100G deployments on our European and Asia-Pacific long-
haul networks, major U.S. backbone routes, and U.S. metro network. We have also completed a first office application of 200G technology on our U.S.
long-haul network. This technology allows more information to be carried on a single wavelength while increasing the distance it can be sent without
additional loss of signal quality .
Global business is rapidly evolving to an “everything-as-a-service” model in which business customers seek cloud-based, conver ged enterprise solutions
delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of pack et optical transport strategy , Verizon is creating a single,
high-capacity global network platform that comb ines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology . The result is a global IP network that
can of fer powerful solutions to these service demands.
We believe that our continued focus on enhancin g our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology
deployments, will help V erizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers.
Competition
The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensi fy further with traditional, non-traditional and emer ging players
seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable compani es, wireless service providers, other domestic and foreign
telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise
solutions.
In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline busine sses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and
integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale markets. We compete with
these full or near-full service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market
presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may af fect our future revenue growth.
We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry:
 
• Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability: Consumers and small business customers are seeking to leverage high-speed connections for entertainment,
communications and productivity . As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To
succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these  increasing bandwidth requirements. In addition, network
reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the global enterprise market. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet
growing bandwidth demand and provide the most reliable and secure network.
 
• Pricing: Cable operat ors, telecom munications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also
a signi ficant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emer ge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and
portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues.
 
• Customer service:  Custo mers expect indust ry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and servi ces evolve, the ability to excel in this area
is important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. In Global
Enterprise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our network to
identify issues before they affect customers. In the Global Wholesale business, we believe service improvement can be achieved through continued system
automation initiatives.

Table of Contents
• Product differ entiation:  As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from
access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Conver ged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline
functionality , are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement.
 
• Innovation: The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively , providers need to continuously review ,
improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of the customer .
In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks so that they can
offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice
services. Several major cable operators also of fer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.
We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility
and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP
services as well as Internet portal providers. In addition, customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content
can be accessed on a TV , computer , tablet or mobile phone.
In the global enterprise market, the customer ’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology conver gence is
driving the expansion of the competitive landsca pe. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the
biggest comp anies in IT services are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in
technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emer ging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery , communication
applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers  have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into
enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT  outsourcers.
Global Who lesale compe tes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for
wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity .
We also compete with competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to CLECs at
significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations char ge their retail customers.
 
New Pr oduct Development and Strategic Initiatives
Technology developments, interconnected markets, shifting consumer needs and conver ging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for
Verizon. We are transforming around the capabili ties of our high-performing networks with a goal of future growth based on delivering what customers want and
need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through
global platforms in video and IoT and create certain opportunities in applications and content for incremental monetization. To execute this strategy , we have
created an or ganization devoted to the development of new products and incubation of new businesses. This or ganization is focused on leveraging all of our assets
to create innovative products and services that can provide our customers with integrated solutions that address their wireless and wireline needs. Several strategic
initiatives have been undertaken by this or ganization in the following areas:
 
• Digital Media and Inter active Entertainment. Verizon has been investing in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and
advertising. On June 23, 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL). AOL is a leader in digital content and advertising. AOL ’s business model
aligns with our approach , and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability
to further develop future revenue streams.
We believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an oppor tunity for revenue growth. We have made investments in
conver ging technologies and services involving content delivery networks (CDNs), video streami ng and related consumer hardware to leverage new content
models. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity . For example,
in 2015 we launched go90, a mobile-first social entertainment platform that provides the opportunity for ad-supported mobile video streaming. Digital content
available on the go90 platform includes live even ts, popular web and television content as well as original content. In January 2016, we introduced FreeBee
Data, a sponsored data service that enables conte nt providers to provide our customers with access to some or all of the provider ’s mobile content, or sponsor
specific consumer actions on a per-click basis, all free of data charges to the customer . In February  2016, we announced we would offer retail postpaid Verizon
Wireless customers video  streaming in go90 over our 4G LTE network free of data charges via the FreeBee Data 360 sponsored data service. Customers must
have the latest version of the go90 application to take advantage of this of fer.
We also began using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service technology to develop our LTE Multicast service, which we used to deliver live events in go90
in 2015. This service has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually
no buffering, regardless of the number of devices using the service. In order to continue to meet the changing needs of our customers, we also are developing
an IP television service. We also believe it is important to have rights to deliver content over a wireless network that does not require an authentication back to
a subscriptio n agreement . For example, our NFL agreement allows our customers to access certain  games live on our 4G LTE network without authenticating
back to any subscription.

Table of Contents
We continue  to invest in Verizon Digital Media Services, which offers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand,
games, softw are and websites, to our customers on their devices at any time. As the digital platfor m reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content,
there is an increasing need for a stable, high-quality video delivery platform. We are focused on providing a simple, end-to-end, global platform for the
delivery of media to customers, which we belie ve will be superior to that offered by the existi ng and highly fragmented media delivery ecosystem. This
platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies as well as businesses focused on delive ring their digital products and services through the Internet.
We also expect, through this platform, to further integrate our Fios and wireless of ferings.
Connected devices and associated online applications continue to experience significant growth as customers are increasingly consuming large amounts of
broadband data, and we expect broadband usage to continue to increase. Our Fios network positions us in the industry with leading broadband speeds and
reliability . Broadband represents a growth opport unity for us as the use of over-the-top video and user generated content and data accelerates and the number
of connected homes and devices continues to grow .
 
• Internet of Things and Telematics . The adoption of IoT technology continues to increase, primarily led by the telematics and transportation industries, as well
as the fields of utility and ener gy management. Our strategy to simplify the IoT and accelerate its adoption includes the launch in 2015 of ThingSpace, our new
IoT platform designed to assist developers create, test, manage and market their IoT-based solutions aimed at major vertical markets, such as energy, health
care and connected cities . ThingSpace comes with a portal that includes immediate access to dedicated application programming interfaces as well as partner
development kits.
Through Verizon Telematics, we provide connectivity and telematics to manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and help businesses manage large vehicle fleets
more efficiently. Our suite of real-time vehicle communications services and applications connects automobiles with content services and call centers. Our
platform enables factory and aftermarket-installed automotive safety and security features as well as location-based services and vehicle diagnostics. We
provide usage-based data services to new vehicles in the United States, China and Europe. Our Networkfleet solution provides commercial fleet managers
throughout North America with real-time access to data that yields operational efficiencies, increased vehicle reliability and improved driver safety . We also
provide this service to over 28,900 vehicles operated by V erizon. W e are further expanding our telematics portfolio to add asset tracking capabilities.
During the third quarter of 2015, we announced the availability of Hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service, to consumers. With this
subscription-based servic e, drivers will have diagnostic technology in their vehicles, access to live assistance and will be able to request roadside assistance
with GPS accuracy when needed. Hum also of fers the ability to connect with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and of fer solutions.
 
• Fostering Effective Partnerships and Alliances . As a market leader in offering differentiated solutions to our connected customers across all their devices at
home, at work and on the go, Verizon will contin ue to focus on strategic partnerships as an important pillar of our future strategy . Strategic partnerships are
aimed at complementing and augmenting our strengths, expanding our addressable market, accelerating our pace of innovation, enabling faster delivery of
solutions such as media, IoT and cloud to the marketplace and, where possible, lowering our market and execution risk. Strong partnerships are expected to
further our efforts to offer comprehensive solutions for our customers. We look to formulate strategic partnerships and alliances with a global orientation,
which will benefit us in terms of technology sourcing, content acquisition, consumer insights, and application ecosystems.
We believe these investm ents will assist us in bringing innovative next generation products and services to market and uncovering new sources of revenue,
increasing revenue from existing projects and leveraging our strengths across the company .
 
Patents, T rademarks and Licenses
Verizon owns or has licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business.
We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within
the United States and abroad. Verizon also active ly grants licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards
and restrictions, to other  companies that enable such companies to utilize certain Verizon intellec tual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their
products and services. Such licenses enable such third-party licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizon’ s research and development efforts. While these
licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to Verizon, we do not believe that loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual
property rights, would have a material ef fect on our results of operations.
Verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or
other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights.
These claims , whether against us directly or again st third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require
us to pay damages or royalties, or cease of fering the relevant products or services.

Regulatory and Competitive T rends
Regulatory and Competitive Landscape
Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitor s include other voice and data service providers such as other
wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional
companies. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existin g customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying
competition that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services
offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator . The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other V erizon services are subject to state and local regulation.
FCC Regulation
Wireless Services
The FCC regulates several aspects of Verizon’ s wireless operations. Generally , the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition, and transfer
of wireless communications systems. All wireles s services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC
oversight. Verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. It can meet spectrum needs by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum
from others, or by participating in a competitiv e bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews,
approvals, and potential conditions.
Today , Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data
services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of
Verizon’ s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide
services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called “open access” FCC regulations, which generally
require licen sees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has
also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards,
provision of enhanced 91 1 services, roaming obligations, and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities.
Broadband
Verizon offers many different broadband servic es. Traditionally , the FCC has recognized that broadband Internet access services are “information services”
subject to a “light touch” regulatory approach rather than the traditional, utilities-style regulations that apply to traditional voice services. In its order imposing so-
called “network neutrality” rules, the FCC reversed course in 2015 and declared that broadband Internet access services will now be treated as
“telecommunications services” subject to comm on carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This decision creates uncertainty
concerning the level of regulation that will apply to broadband services going forward. These regulations will limit the ways that broadband Internet access
service providers can structure business arrangem ents and manage their networks and could spur additional restrictions, including rate regulation, which could
adversely affect broadband investment and innov ation. The FCC’ s decision is being challenged in court, and the proper scope of such regulations is also being
debated in Congress. Verizon remains committed to the open Internet which provides consum ers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful
websites and content when, where, and how they want, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at
http://responsibility .verizon.com/broadband-commitment. Verizon opposes the shift to utilities style regulation, however , which we believe is unnecessary ,
unlawful and harmful to the broader Internet ecosystem and our customers.
Wireline V oice
Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on newer technologies such as VoIP. For
regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be “common carrier” services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened
regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions, and other aspects of the services.  The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP
but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 91 1 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.
Video
Verizon offers a multi-channel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these
rules also generally apply to Verizon. In additio n, the Act generally requires companies to obtain a local cable franchise, and the FCC has adopted rules that
interpret and implement this requirement. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to
obtain a franchise from local authorities.

Inter carrier Compensation and Network Access
The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks
and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. In many instances, Verizon makes payments to other providers, and in turn Verizon receives some
payments from other carriers. In 2011, the FCC issued a broad reform order changing, among other things, the framework for many of the per-minute rates that
carriers charge each other for the exchange of voice traffic. The new rules gradually reduce many of these rates to zero. The FCC also regulates some of the rates
and terms and conditions for certain wireline “special access” and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services. For
example, on the wireline side V erizon sells wholesale circuits to other voice and data service providers. On the wireless side, V erizon purchases special access and
other services to transpo rt traffic to and from cell towers. In addition, as required by the Act, Verizon unbundles certain wireline network elements and makes
these facilities and services available to other network providers.
Universal Service
The Communications Act charges the FCC with ensuring that certain groups and areas have access to communications services, including rural and other high-
cost areas, low income subscribers, schools and libraries, rural health-care organizations, and deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The FCC established different
subsidy and discount programs to achieve these goals. To pay for these programs, the FCC requires contributions from providers such as Verizon based on
reported revenues for certain services. V erizon also receives some payments from some of these programs but is a net payer into them.
State Regulation and Local Regulation
Wireless Services
The Communications Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does
not prohibit states from regulating the other “terms and conditions” of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing
matters and impose reporting requirements. Seve ral states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving)
and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals
for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.
Wireline Services
State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’ s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an
“incumbent local exchange carrier” in 13 states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and
other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many
states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and to comply with certain
one-time and ongoing obligations as a result.
 
Envir onmental Matters
Reserves have been established to cover environm ental matters relating to discontinued businesses  and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include
funds to address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In
September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken
primary responsibility for addressing the contami nation at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to
the past and future expen ses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites
requiring remediation.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
The followin g discussion of “Risk Factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or futur e
performance. This information should be read in conjunction with “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations”
and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are
important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our futur e results to differ materially from our historical
results and fr om expectations r eflected in forwar d-looking statements.
Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations.
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and
demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of
our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower -cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly , under these
conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In
addition, adverse econom ic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these
events were to occur , it could have a material adverse ef fect on our results of operations.
We face significant competition that may reduce our profits.
We face significant competition in our industry . The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional
distinctions among wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other
telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, applicatio n and device providers and providers of VoIP services. While
these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive
offerings. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relations hips with their customers through commercial offers that vary
service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting Verizon Wireless customers. Our ability to
compete effectively will depend on, among other  things, our network quality , capacity and covera ge, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our
customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital
resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry , including new technologies and business
models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond
successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits.
If we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing cons umer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline
in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits.
Our industry is experienc ing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumer s an array of choices for their communications needs and allow
new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology , enhance our existing
offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unab le to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a
timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of
new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in
the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and
attract customers could be adversely af fected.
In addition to introducing  new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprof itable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a
cost-ef fective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.
We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business.
We depend on various key suppliers and vendor s to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network
equipment and handsets, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our handset and other device suppliers
often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipse ts, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to
provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when
requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the costs and time lags that can be associated
with transitioning from one supplier to another , our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services
of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such
disruption could increase  our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
The suppliers and vendo rs on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving
claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry . We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by
any such litigation. W e expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology .

Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely af fect our business prospects or results of operations.
Our domestic operations are subject to regulation  by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various
foreign gove rnments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and
to provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with
prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is
impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or
state courts of regulatory  rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and
services. Similarly , we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses neede d to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing
licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of
our licenses could have a material adverse ef fect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
New laws or regulations or changes to the existin g regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we
manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a
manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, in its order imposing so-called “network neutrality” regulations, the FCC reversed course
in 2015 on the longstand ing “light touch” approa ch and “reclassified” broadband Internet access services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style
common carriage regulation. While the full scope and effect of this new regulatory approach is uncertain, these rules limit the ways that a broadband Internet
access service provider can structure business arrangements and manage its network and open the door to additional restrictions, including rate regulation that
could advers ely affect broadband investment and innovation. These rules are being challenged in the courts and the proper scope of such regulations is being
debated in Congress, but the outcome and timing of those challenges and debates remain uncerta in. As another example, we hold certain wireless licenses that
require us to comply with so-called “open access” FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices
and applications of their choice. Moreover , certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which
could signifi cantly increa se the cost of implementing and introducing new services. The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any
related court  decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our
networks.
Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse ef fect on our business.
Cyber attack s, including through the use of malw are, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting and other means for obtaining
unauthorized access to or disrupting the operatio n of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an
adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or
employees or valuable technical and marketing  information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations. Cyber attacks against companies,
including Verizon, have increased in frequency , scope and potential harm in recent years. Further , the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular
groups or persons. Thes e attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography , including jurisdictions where law
enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. While, to date, we
have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions
we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insuf ficient to repel or mitigate the effects of
a major cyber attack in the future.
The inability  to operate our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited
period of time, may result in significant expenses  to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major
cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on
cyber security measures and the use of alternate  resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. The potential costs associated with these
attacks could  exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further , certain of Verizon’ s businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and
cloud services to busines s customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a
cyber attack. In addition , if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about Verizon and intellectual
property , or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against  cyber attacks, it could result in lawsuits, government claims,
investigations or proceedings, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. Any of these occurrences could
result in a material adverse ef fect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.
Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such
events could cause signi ficant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations  rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our
customers. While we maintain insurance covera ge for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance
coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.
These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the
 
18
Table of Contents
equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers.  A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical
damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these
occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.
Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if V erizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt.
As of Decem ber 31, 2015, Verizon had approximately $110.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as approximately $7.9 billion of unused borrowing
capacity under its existing credit facility . Verizon’ s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:
 
 • requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and
the preferred  stock issued by an entity acquired from Vodafone, which would reduce the funds Verizon has available for other purposes, such as
working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;
 
 • making it more difficult  or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;
 
 • reducing V erizon’ s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions;
 
 • making V erizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and
 
 • exposing V erizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates.
In addition, the term loan agreement Verizon entered into in connection with the Wireless Transac tion requires Verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless
Verizon’ s credit ratings are at or above a certain level, which could limit V erizon’ s ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing.
We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit
markets. Adverse change s in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to
obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowi ng costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings
assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance  as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these
ratings woul d likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets
could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also af fect our access to financing.
Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.
With approximately 177,700 employees and approximately 203,000 retirees as of December 31, 2015 eligible to participate in V erizon’ s benefit plans, the costs of
pension bene fits and active and retiree healthcar e benefits have a significant impact on our profitability . Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future
funding requirements for these plans, are affecte d by several factors, including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Educat ion Reconciliation Act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by
our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses.
If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.
A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the
renegotiation of our labor contracts.
As of Decem ber 31, 2015, approximately 25% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. Labor contracts covering approximately 36,300 employees of
our wireline business expired on August 1, 2015.  We continue to be engaged in negotiations with our unions regarding new contracts. During the course of these
negotiations we could experience lengthy work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including a loss of revenue and strained
relationships with customers. We cannot predict the length of any such work stoppage. Depending on the outcome of the negotiations, we may incur additional
costs. In addition, while less than 1% of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses are represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success
unions may have in or ganizing these workforces or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs.
We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.
We are subject to a subst antial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder deriv ative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions,
wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In
 
19

addition, our wireless business also faces perso nal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio
frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless
phones. W e may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.

improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that house network equipmen t, and buildings that are used for administrative and other
purposes. Substantially all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in the network and high set-up relocation
costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the United States comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, garage
work centers , switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office
equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction and leasehold improvements. A portion of our property is subject to the liens of their respective mortgages

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings
In October 2013, the California Attorney General’ s Office notified Verizon California Inc. and other Verizon companies of potential violations of California state
hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from  the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are
cooperating with this investigation and continue to review our operations relating to the management of hazardous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged
violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material.

Stock Repur chases
In March 2014, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a three-year share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Company’ s common
stock. Under the program, shares may be repurch ased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through plans complying with Rule
10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program , if any, will depend on market conditions and the Company’ s
capital allocation priorities.
During the fourth quarter  of 2015, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon common stock. At December 31, 2015, the maximum number of shares that
could be purchased by or on behalf of V erizon under our share buyback program was 97.2 million.
In February 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion of
the Company’ s common stock. On February 10, 2015, Verizon received an initial delivery of 86.2 million shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion.
On June 5, 2015, the ASR agreement was settled  and an additional 15.4 million shares were delivered to Verizon and retired. In total, 101.6 million shares were
delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $49.21.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’ s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchan ge Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating
to the registr ant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized  and reported within required time periods using the criteria for
effective internal control established in Interna l Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the registrant’ s disclosure controls and
procedures were ef fective as of December 31, 2015.
In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that
are intended to ensure an effective internal contro l environment. We are also continuing an initiative to standardize and centralize transaction-processing activities
within our accounting processes, which we expect to continue over the next several years. These initiatives will incorporate certain changes in personnel as well.
In connection with these initiatives and the resulting changes in our financial systems and transaction-processing activities, the Company continues to review the
design and documentation of our internal control system and to enhance our processes as need ed to ensure that controls over our financial reporting remain
effective.
Except as noted above, there were no changes in the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Overview
Verizon Com munications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of
communications, inform ation and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world,
we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility , reliable
network connectivity , security and control. We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline. Our wireless business, operating as Verizon Wireless,
provides voice and data services and equipment sales across the United States (U.S.) using one of the most extensive and reliable wireless networks. Our wireline
business provides consumer , business and gover nment customers with communications products and enhanced services, including broadband data and video,
corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services, and also owns
and operates one of the most expansive end-to-end global Internet Protocol (IP) networks. We have a highly skilled, diverse and dedicated workforce of
approximately 177,700 employees as of December 31, 2015.
To compete effectively in today’ s dynamic marke tplace, we are focused on transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks with a goal of
future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the
markets we serve, develo p new business models through global platforms in video and Internet of Things (IoT) and create certain opportunities in applications
and content for incremental monetization. Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into
service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber optic network that supports our businesses, maintain our networks and develop
and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities. We believe that steady and consistent investments in our
networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth. Our network leadership will continue to be the hallmark of our brand,
and provide the fundamental strength at the connectivity , platform and solutions layers upon which we build our competitive advantage.
Strategic T ransactions
Spectrum Auction
In January 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the Advanced Wireless Services (AWS)-3
band. We participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which  we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted
us these spectrum licenses in April 2015.
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
On May 12, 2015, we entered into an Agreement  and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we commenced a tender
offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes. On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The
aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares
exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law. If they had not exercised these rights, Verizon would have paid an additional $330 million for such shares at the
closing.
AOL is a leader in the digital content and advertising platform space. Verizon has been investing in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital
content and advertising. AOL ’s business model aligns with this approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a
digital advertising platform enhances our ability  to further develop future revenue streams. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.
Access Line Sale
On February  5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which
Verizon will sell its local  exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched
and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.5
billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from V erizon by Frontier . The transaction,
which includes the acqui sition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, does
not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently included in Verizon’ s continuing operations and
classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The transaction is subject
to the satisf action of certain closing conditions including, among others, receipt of federal approvals from the FCC and the antitrust authorities and state
regulatory approvals. All federal and state regulatory approvals have been obtained. W e expect this transaction to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Based on the number of voice connections and Fios Internet and video subscribers, respectively , as of December 31, 2015, the transaction will result in Frontier
acquiring approximately  3.4 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses
from V erizon.
Tower Monetization T ransaction
During Marc h 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive
rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion (the Tower Monetization Transaction). Under the
terms of the leases, Ame rican Tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate the towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire,
American T ower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this
transaction, we sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market
rates, with options to renew . We have accounted for the upfront payment as deferred rent and as a financing obligation.
Wireless T ransaction
On February  21, 2014, we completed the acquisi tion of Vodafone Group Plc’s (Vodafone) indirect 45% interest in Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless for
aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion (the Wireless Transaction). The consider ation paid was primarily comprised of cash of approximately
$58.89 billio n and Verizon common stock with a value of approximately $61.3 billion. With full control of Verizon Wireless enhancing our operational efficiency ,
we believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive industry. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.
Business Overview
Wireless
In our Wireless business , revenues grew 4.6% during 2015 driven by a 54.4% increase in equipm ent revenue as a result of an increase in device sales, primarily
smartphones, under the Verizon device payment program (formerly known as Verizon Edge), partially offset by a decline in device sales under our traditional
fixed-term service plans. Customers on our fixed-term service plans have historically paid highe r fees for their wireless service in exchange for the ability to
purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices. Under the Verizon device payment program , our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or tablets at
unsubsidized prices on an installment basis (a device installment plan). Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program
or on a compatible device that they already own pay lower service fees (unsubsidized service pricing) as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans.
The increase in activations of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program has resulted in a relative shift of revenue from service revenue to
equipment revenue and caused a change in the timing of the recognition of revenue. This shift in revenue was the result of recognizing a higher amount of
equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices under the device payment program. For the year ended December 31, 2015, phone activations under the Verizon
device payment program represented approxima tely 54% of retail postpaid phones activated compared to approximately 18% during 2014. During the fourth
quarter of 2015, phone  activations under the Verizon device payment program represented approximately 67% of retail postpaid phones activated. At
December 31, 2015, approximately 29% of our retail postpaid phone connections participated in the Verizon device payment program compared to approximately
8% at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, approximately 42% of our retail postpaid phone connections were on unsubsidized service pricing. At
December 31, 2015, retail postpaid connections were 4.4% higher than at December 31, 2014, with smartphones representing 84% of our retail postpaid phone
base at December 31, 2015 compared to 79% at December 31, 2014.
In August 2015, we launched a simplified shared  data plan, the Verizon Plan, that offers customers various sizes of data packages that can be shared among up to
10 devices on a customer ’s account. New customers who wish to participate in this new plan can do so by purchasing a device from Verizon either under our
device paym ent program  or at full retail, or by using their own compatible device. In addition, our current customers have the option of either moving to the
Verizon Plan, subject to certain restrictions, or keeping their existing plan.
We are focusing our wireless capital spending on adding capacity and density to our fourth generation (4G) Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, which is
available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately 312 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in
Rural Ameri ca partners. Approximately 91% of our total data traffic in December 2015 was carried on our 4G LTE network. We are investing in the densification
of our network by utilizing small cell technology , in-building solutions and distributed antenna solutions. Densification enables us to add capacity to manage
mobile video consumption and demand for IoT, as well as position us for future fifth-generation  (5G) technology . In 2015, we announced our commitment to
developing and deploying 5G wireless technology . We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and
appropriate requirements for this next generation of wireless technology .
Wireline
In our Wireline business,  revenues declined 1.8%  during 2015 primarily due to revenue declines in Global Enterprise resulting from lower voice services and data
networking revenues, as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. To compensate for the shrinking market for traditional voice service, we continue
to build our Wireline segment around data, video and advanced business services – areas where  demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. The
decrease in revenues in our Wireline segment was partially offset by revenue increases in Consum er retail driven by Fios. During the year ended December 31,
2015, Fios represented approximately 79% of Consumer retail revenue compared to approximately 76% in 2014. As the penetration of Fios products increases,
we continue  to seek ways to increase revenue and further realize operating and capital efficiencies as well as maximize profitability . As more applications are
developed for this high-speed service, we expect that Fios will become a hub for managing multip le home services that will eventually be part of the digital grid,
including not just entertainment and communicat ions, but also IoT technology used to support wireless communications in areas such as home monitoring, health
monitoring, ener gy management and utilities management.
We continue  to develop offerings on our Fios platform. During 2015, Verizon announced the intro duction of Fios Custom TV, which offers customers the option
of purchasin g a package of channels that include s a base set of select national networks and local broadcast stations plus their choice of two sets of channels
grouped into various content categories, such as news, sports and entertainment. Customers can add more sets of categorized channels to their Custom TV
package for an additional monthly fee. As with all Fios TV packages, Custom TV customers also receive the Fios Local Package, which contains local versions of
the Fox, CBS, NBCU, and ABC broadcast stations and other similar local content.
Capital Expenditur es and Investments
We continue to invest in our wireless network, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future.
During 2015, these investments included $17.8 billion for capital expenditures and $9.9 billion for acquisitions of wireless licenses. In addition, we acquired AOL
to enhance our digital media and advertising capabilities. See “Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities” and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information. We believe that our inves tments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an even more
efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy .
Trends
In the sections that follo w, we provide information about the important aspects of our operations and investments, both at the consolidated and segment levels,
and discuss our results of operations, financial position and sources and uses of cash. In addition, we highlight key trends and uncertainties to the extent
practicable.
The industries that we operate in are highly competitive, which we expect to continue particularl y as traditional, non-traditional and emer ging service providers
seek increased market share. We believe that our high-quality customer base and superior networks differentiate us from our competitors and enable us to provide
enhanced communication s experiences to our customers. We believe our focus on the fundamentals of running a good business, including operating excellence
and financial discipline, gives us the ability to plan and manage through changing economic and competitive conditions. We will continue to invest for growth,
which we believe is the key to creating value for our shareowners. We are investing in innovative technology , like wireless networks and high-speed fiber, as well
as the platfo rms that will position us to capture incremental profitable growth in new areas, like mobile video and IoT, to position ourselves at the center of
growth trends of the future.
Connection and Operating T rends
In our Wireless segment, we expect to continue to attract and maintain the loyalty of high-qual ity retail postpaid customers, capitalizing on demand for data
services and bringing our customers new ways  of using wireless services in their daily lives. We expect that future connection growth will be driven by
smartphones, tablets and other connected devices. W e believe these devices will attract and retain higher value retail postpaid connections, contribute to continued
increases in the penetration of data services and help us remain competitive with other wireless carriers. We expect future growth opportunities will be dependent
on expanding the penetration of our network services, offering innovative wireless devices for both consumer and business customers and increasing the number
of ways that our customers can connect with our network and services, and we expect to manage churn by focusing on improving the customer experience
through simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels.
Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow , wireless
service providers are offering service plans that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or
gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage at competitive prices. Some wireless service providers also allow customers to roll over unused data
allowances to the next billing period. Furthermore, some wireless service providers offer price plans to new customers that undercut pricing under the customer ’s
service plan with its current wireless provider . Some wireless providers also offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizon
Wireless.
Many wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options that decouple service pricing from equipment pricing and
blur the traditional boun dary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device installment plans, which provide customers with the
ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historical ly, wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans
whereby , in exchange for the customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service providers significantly , and in some cases fully,
subsidized the customer ’s device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on
device instal lment plans.  We and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued the use of device subsidies. As a result of the increased penetration
of device installment plans, we expect the number of customers on plans with unsubsidized servic e pricing to continue to grow in 2016. We compete in this area
by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price, while meeting their wireless service
needs.
In our Wireline segment , we have experienced continuing access line losses as customers have disconnected both primary and secondary lines and switched to
alternative technologies such as wireless, voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) and cable for voice  and data services. We expect to continue to experience access
line losses as customers continue to switch to alternate technologies. We also expect Consumer retail revenues to increase, primarily driven by our Fios services,
as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas.
Despite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our Wireline segment by providing network reliability , offering
product bundles that include broadband Interne t access, digital television and local and long distance voice services, offering more robust IP products and
services, and acceleratin g our cloud computing and IoT strategies. We will also continue to focus  on cost efficiencies to attempt to offset adverse impacts from
unfavorable economic conditions and competitive pressures.
Operating Revenue
We expect to experience revenue growth in our Wireless segment in 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in the sale of devices under the Verizon device
payment program. The increase in activations of these devices with unsubsidized service pricing results in a relative shift of revenue from service revenue to
equipment revenue and causes a change in the timing of the recognition of revenue. This shift in revenue is the result of recognizing a higher amount of
equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices under the device payment program. As a result of the increased penetration of device installment plans, we
expect the number of customers on plans with unsubsidized service pricing to continue to grow in 2016.
We expect Fios broadband and video penetration to positively impact our Mass Markets revenue  and subscriber base. Although we have experienced revenue
declines in our Global Enterprise business, we expect our Global Enterprise business to be positiv ely impacted by additional revenues from application services,
such as our cloud, security and other solutions -based services and from continued customer migration of their services to Private IP and other strategic
networking services. We believe the trend in these growth areas as well as our offerings in telematics and video streaming will help offset the continuing decline
in revenues in our W ireline segment related to retail voice connection losses and the continued decline in our legacy wholesale and enterprise markets.
We are focused on deve loping new products and services as well as commercial models in mobile video and the IoT to monetize usage on our networks and
expand our revenue mix. Although we do not expect to realize material incremental revenues from these initiatives in 2016, we expect these initiatives will have a
long-term positive impact on revenues.
Operating Costs and Expenses
We anticipate our overall wireless operating costs will increase as a result of the expected increase  in the volume of smartphone sales, which will result in higher
equipment costs. In addition, we expect content costs for our Fios video service to continue to increase. We also expect to incur costs related to the development
of new products and services in mobile video and IoT. However , we expect to achieve certain cost efficiencies in 2016 and beyond as we continue to streamline
our business processes with a focus on improving productivity and increasing profitability .
Upon the closing of the sale of our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, we expect that our Wireline segment
EBITDA margin and operating income margin will decline. We expect to continue to undertake initiatives, including headcount and organizational realignment
initiatives, to address our cost structure to mitigate this impact to our consolidated mar gins.
Cash Flow fr om Operations
We create value for our shareowners by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable
growth, thereby increasi ng customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In addition, we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our
dividend payout to shareowners. Verizon’ s Board of Directors increased the Company’ s quarterly dividend by 2.7% during 2015, making this the ninth
consecutive year in which we have raised our dividend.
Our goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help us to grow the
business, acquire spectrum licenses (see “Cash Flows from Investing Activities”), pay dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back shares of
our outstanding common stock (see “Cash Flows from Financing Activities”). We expect to use the proceeds from the Frontier transaction to reduce our debt
levels. W e also remain committed to returning to our pre W ireless T ransaction credit-rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.
Capital Expenditur es
Our 2016 capital program  includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including 4G LTE and Fios, the continued expansion of our core networks,
including our IP and data center enhancements, and support for our copper -based legacy voice networks and other expenditures to drive operating efficiencies.
The level and the timing  of the Company’ s capital expenditures within these broad categories can vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors outside our
control, inclu ding, for example, material weather events. We are replacing copper wire with fiber-optic cable which will not alter our capital program but should
result in lower maintena nce costs in the future. Capital expenditures were $17.8 billion in 2015 and $17.2 billion in 2014. We believe that we have significant
discretion over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures on a Company-wide basis as we are not subject to any agreement that would require significant
capital expe nditures on a designated schedule or upon the occurrence of designated events. We expect capital expenditures in 2016, which will be primarily
focused on adding capacity to our 4G LTE network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands, to be in the range of approximately $17.2
billion to $17.7 billion. This includes capital spending up to approximately $150 million for the properties to be sold to Frontier .
Consolidated Results of Operations
In this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight items of a non-operational nature that are not included in our segment results. We have
two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services. In “Segment
Results of Operations,” we review the performance of our two reportable segments.
On February 21, 2014, we completed the acquis ition of Vodafone’ s indirect 45% interest in Verizon Wireless. As a result, for 2014 our results reflect our 55%
ownership of Verizon Wireless through the closin g of the Wireless Transaction and reflect our full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the closing of the Wireless
Transaction through December 31, 2014.
Corporate and other includes the operations of AOL and related businesses, unallocated corporate expenses, the results of other businesses, such as our
investments in unconsolidated businesses, pension and other employee benefit related costs and lease financing. Effective January 1, 2014, we have also
reclassified the results of certain businesses, such as development stage businesses that support our strategic initiatives, from our Wireline segment to Corporate
and other . The impact of this reclassification was not material to our consolidated financial statements or our segment results of operations. Corporate and other
also includes the historical results of divested operations and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due
to their non-operational nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings.
Gains and losses that are not individually signif icant are included in all segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker ’s
assessment of segment performance. We believe that this presentation assists users of our financial statements in better understanding our results of operations
and trends from period to period.
On July 1, 2014, our Wireline segment sold a non-strategic business (see “Acquisitions and Dive stitures”). Accordingly , the historical Wireline results for these
operations, which were not material to our consolidated financial statements or our segment results of operations, have been reclassified to Corporate and other to
reflect comparable segment operating results. The results of operations related to this divestiture included within Corporate and other are as follows:

2015 Compar ed to 2014
The increase in consolid ated revenues during 2015 was primarily due to higher equipment revenu es in our Wireless segment, higher revenues as a result of the
acquisition of AOL and higher Mass Markets revenues driven by Fios services at our Wireline segment. Partially offsetting these increases were lower Service
revenues at our W ireless segment and lower Global Enterprise revenues at our W ireline segment.
Wireless’ revenues increased $4.0 billion, or 4.6%, during 2015 primarily as a result of growth in equipment revenue. Equipment revenue increased by $6.0
billion, or 54.4% during 2015 as a result of an increase in device sales, primarily smartphones, under the Verizon device payment program, partially offset by a
decline in device sales under traditional fixed-term service plans. Service revenue, which does not include recurring device installment billings related to the
Verizon device payment program, decreased by $2.2 billion, or 3.1%, during 2015 primarily driven by an increase in the activation of devices purchased under the
Verizon device payment program on plans with unsubsidized service pricing. The increase in these activations resulted in a relative shift of revenue from service
revenue to equipment revenue and caused a change in the timing of the recognition of revenue. This shift in revenue was the result of recognizing a higher
amount of equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices under the device payment program. During the year ended December 31, 2015, phone activations
under the Verizon device payment program represented approximately 54% of retail postpaid phones activated compared to approximately 18% during 2014.
During the fourth quarte r of 2015, phone activations under the Verizon device payment progr am represented approximately 67% of retail postpaid phones
activated. At December 31, 2015, approximately 29% of our retail postpaid phone connections participated in the Verizon device payment program compared to
approximately 8% at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, approximately 42% of our retail postpaid phone connections were on unsubsidized service
pricing. Service revenue plus recurring device installment billings related to the V erizon device payment program increased 2.0% during 2015.
Retail postpa id connection net additions decreased during 2015 primarily due to a decrease in retail postpaid connection gross additions, partially offset by a
lower retail postpaid connection churn rate. Retail postpaid connections per account increased  as of December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014,
primarily due to increases in Internet devices.
Wireline’ s revenues decreased $0.7 billion, or 1.8%, during 2015 primarily as a result of declines in Global Enterprise, partially offset by higher Mass Markets
revenues driven by Fios services.
Mass Markets revenues increased $0.4 billion, or 2.4%, during 2015 primarily due to the expansion of Fios services (voice, internet and video), including our Fios
Quantum of ferings, as well as changes in our pricing strategies, partially of fset by the continued decline of local exchange revenues.
Global Enter prise revenu es decreased $0.7 billio n, or 5.2%, during 2015 primarily due to lower voice services and data networking revenues, lower networking
solutions revenues, a decline in customer premise equipment revenues and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates.
Corporate and other revenues increased $1.3 billion, or 60.6%, during 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisition of AOL, which was completed on June 23,
2015.
2014 Compar ed to 2013
The increase in consolid ated revenues during 2014 was primarily due to higher revenues at Wireless, as well as higher Mass Markets revenues driven by Fios
services at our W ireline segment. Partially of fsetting these increases were lower Global Enterprise Core and Global Wholesale revenues at our W ireline segment.
Wireless’ revenues incre ased $6.6 billion, or 8.2%, during 2014 primarily as a result of growth in service revenue and equipment revenue. The increase in service
revenue, which does not include recurring equipment installment billings related to the Verizon device payment program, during 2014 was primarily driven by
higher retail  postpaid service revenue, which increased largely as a result of an increase in retail postpaid connections as well as the continued increase in
penetration of 4G LTE smartphones and tablets through our More Everything plans. Retail postpaid connection net additions increased during 2014 primarily due
to an increase in retail postpaid connection gross additions partially offset by an increase in our retail postpaid connection churn rate. Retail postpaid connections
per account increased as of December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 primarily due to the increased penetration of tablets. Equipment revenue
increased during 2014 primarily due to an increase in device sales under both traditional fixed-term service plans and the V erizon device payment program.
Wireline’ s revenues decreased $0.2 billion, or 0.5%, during 2014 primarily as a result of declines in Global Enterprise Core and Global Wholesale, partially offset
by higher Mass Markets revenues driven by Fios services and increased Strategic services revenues within Global Enterprise.
Mass Markets revenues increased $0.7 billion, or 3.8%, during 2014 primarily due to the expansion of Fios services (voice, internet and video), including our Fios
Quantum of ferings, as well as changes in our pricing strategies, partially of fset by the continued decline of local exchange revenues.
Global Enter prise revenu es decreased $0.5 billion, or 3.6%, during 2014 primarily due to lower voice services and data networking revenues, the contraction of
market rates  due to competition and a decline in Core customer premise equipment revenues. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in Strategic
services revenues, primarily due to growth in our application services, such as our cloud and data center of ferings and contact center solutions.
Global Wholesale revenues decreased $0.4 billion, or 5.6%, during 2014 primarily due to a decline in data revenues driven by the continuing demand for high-
speed digita l data services from fiber-to-the-cel l customers upgrading their core data circuits to Ethernet facilities, as well as a decline in traditional voice
revenues. During 2014, we also experienced a decline in domestic wholesale connections.

Consolidated operating expenses decreased during 2015 primarily due to non-operational credits recorded in 2015 as compared to non-operational charges
recorded in 2014 (see “Other Items”). Consolidated operating expenses increased during 2014 primarily due to non-operational charges recorded in 2014 as
compared to non-operational credits recorded in 2013 (see “Other Items”) as well as increased operating expenses at W ireless.
2015 Compar ed to 2014
Cost of Services
Cost of services include s the following costs directly attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted
services, network access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems suppo rt, and costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical
facilities. Aggregate customer care costs, which  include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and
administrative expense.
Cost of services increased during 2015 primarily due to an increase in costs as a result of the acqu isition of AOL, higher rent expense as a result of an increase in
wireless macro and small cell sites, higher wirel ess network costs from an increase in fiber facilities supporting network capacity expansion and densification,
including the deployment of small cell technology , a volume-driven increase in costs related to the wireless device protection package offered to our customers as
well as a $0.5 billion increase in content costs at our Wireline segment. Partially offsetting these  increases were a $0.3 billion decline in employee costs and a
$0.3 billion decline in access costs at our Wireline segment. Also offsetting the increase was a decrease in Cost of services reflected in the results of operations
related to a non-strategic W ireline business that was divested on July 1, 2014.
Wireless Cost of Equipment
Wireless cost of equipment increased during 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in the average cost per unit, driven by a shift to higher priced units in the
mix of devices sold, partially of fset by a decline in the number of units sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expense includes: salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product, bad debt char ges, taxes other
than income  taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, customer billing, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service
fees, and rent and utilities for administrative space. Also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed in “Cost of Services” above.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during 2015 primarily due to non-operational credits, primarily severance, pension and benefit credits,
recorded in 2015 as compared to non-operational charges, primarily severance, pension and benefit charges, recorded in 2014 (see “Other Items”). Also
contributing to this decrease was a decline in sales commission expense at our Wireless segment, which was driven by an increase in activations under the
Verizon device payment program. The decrease is partially offset by an increase in bad debt expe nse at our Wireless segment. The increase in bad debt expense
was primarily driven by a volume increase in our installment receivables, as the credit quality of our customers remained consistent throughout the periods
presented.
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased  during 2015 primarily due to $0.9 billion of depreciation and amortization expense not being recorded on our
depreciable Wireline assets in California, Florida and Texas which were classified as held for sale as of February 5, 2015, partially offset by an increase in
depreciable assets at our W ireless segment.
We will not record depreciation and amortization expense on our depreciable Wireline assets in California, Florida and Texas through the closing of the
transaction with Frontier , which is expected to occur at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
2014 Compar ed to 2013
Wireless Cost of Equipment
Wireless cost of equipment increased during 2014 primarily due to an increase in cost of equipment sales at our Wireless segment as a result of an increase in the
number of devices sold as well as an increase in the cost per unit.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gene ral and administrative expense increased during 2014 primarily due to non-operatio nal charges, primarily severance, pension and benefit charges,
recorded in 2014 as compared to non-operational credits, primarily severance, pension and benefit credits, recorded in 2013 (see “Other Items”).
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2014 primarily due to a decrease in net depreciable assets at our Wireline segment, partially offset by an
increase in depreciable assets at our W ireless segment.

Consolidated Operating Income and EBITDA
Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are
presented below , are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. Management believes
that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they
exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating
operating performance in relation to our competi tors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense,
equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and (expense), net to net income.
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding the effect of non-operational items and the impact of divested operations from the calculation of
Consolidated EBITDA. Management believes that this measure provides additional relevant and useful information to investors and other users of our financial
data in evaluating the effectiveness of our opera tions and underlying business trends in a manne r that is consistent with management’ s evaluation of business
performance. See “Other Items” for additional details regarding these non-operational items.
Operating expenses include pension and benefit related credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates and an estimated
return on plan assets. These estimates are updated in the fourth quarter to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. The adjustment
has been recognized in the income statement during the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of
actuarial gains/losses.
It is management’ s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understand ing of Verizon’ s GAAP financial information, and it should be
considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP . Each non-GAAP financial measure is
presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP
financial information presented may be determined or calculated dif ferently by other companies.

Other Consolidated Results
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Businesses
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated businesses  decreased $1.9 billion during 2015 and increased $1.6 billion during 2014 primarily due to the gain of $1.9
billion recor ded on the sale of our interest in Vodafone Omnitel N.V. (the Omnitel Transaction, and such interest, the Omnitel Interest) during the first quarter of
2014, which was part of the consideration for the W ireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014.

Total interest costs on debt balances increased during 2015 primarily due to a $4.9 billion incre ase in average debt (see “Consolidated Financial Condition”).
Capitalized interest costs  were higher in 2015 primarily due to an increase in wireless licenses that are currently under development, which was a result of our
winning bid in the FCC spectrum license auction during 2015. The FCC granted us those wireless licenses on April 8, 2015 (see Note 2 for additional
information).
Total interest costs on debt balances increased during 2014 primarily due to the issuance of fixed and floating rate notes to finance the Wireless Transaction (see
“Acquisitions and Divestitures”) resulting in an increase in average debt and a corresponding increase in interest expense, partially offset by a lower effective
interest rate (see “Conso lidated Financial Condition”). Capitalized interest costs were lower in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in wireless licenses that are
currently under development, which was due to the deployment of A WS licenses for commercial service during 2014.

Effective income tax rate    34.9%   21.7%   19.6%        
 
nm– not meaningful
The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The effective income tax
rate for 2015 was 34.9%  compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was primarily due to the
impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension and benefit charges
recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in 2014 in connection with the Omnitel Transaction. The 2014
effective income tax rate also included a benefit from the inclusion of income attributable to Vodafone’ s noncontrolling interest in the Verizon Wireless
partnership prior to the W ireless T ransaction completed on February 21, 2014.
The effective income tax rate for 2014 was 21.7% compared to 19.6% for 2013. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to additional
income taxes on the incremental income from the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014 and was partially offset by the utilization of certain tax
credits in connection with the Omnitel Transact ion in 2014 and the effective income tax rate impact of lower income before income taxes due to severance,
pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014 compared to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2013. The decrease in the provision for income
taxes was primarily due to lower income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014 compared to severance, pension and
benefit credits recorded in 2013.
Our effective income tax rate differed significantly from the statutory federal income tax rate for 2013 due to the inclusion of income attributable to Vodafone’ s
noncontrolling interest in the Verizon Wireless partnership for the full year within our income before the provision for income taxes. In 2013, we recorded a tax
provision on income before the provision for income taxes and when we included the income attributable to Vodafone’ s noncontrolling interest in the Verizon
Wireless partnership in our income before the provision for income taxes it resulted in our effective income tax rate being 13.7 percentage points lower during
2013.
A reconcilia tion of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial
statements.

The decrease  in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests during 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the completion of the Wireless Transaction on
February 21, 2014. As a result, our results reflect our 55% ownership interest of Verizon Wireless  through the closing of the Wireless Transaction and reflect our
full ownersh ip of Verizon Wireless for the remainder of the year. The noncontrolling interests that remained after the completion of the Wireless Transaction
primarily relate to wireless partnership entities.
Segment Results of Operations
We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services. We
measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief operating
decision maker ’s assessment of segment performance.
Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreci ation and amortization (Segment EBITDA), which is presented below , is a non-GAAP measure and does not
purport to be an alternati ve to operating income as a measure of operating performance. Managem ent believes that this measure is useful to investors and other
users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses
related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our
competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income.
Wireless Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Wireless Segment EBITDA by total Wireless revenues. Wireless Segment EBITDA service margin,
also presented below , is calculated by dividing Wireless Segment EBITDA by Wireless service revenues. Wireless Segment EBITDA service margin utilizes
service revenues rather than total revenues. Service revenues primarily exclude equipment revenues in order to reflect the impact of providing service to the
wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Wireline Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Wireline Segment EBITDA by total Wireline revenues.
You can find additional information about our segments in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
Wireless
Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the
United States. Verizon Wireless was formed as a joint venture in April 2000 by the combination of the U.S. wireless operations and interests of Verizon and
Vodafone. Prior to the completion of the Wireless Transaction, Verizon owned a controlling 55% interest in Verizon Wireless and Vodafone owned the remaining
45%. On February 21, 2014, the W ireless T ransaction was completed and V erizon acquired 100% ownership of V erizon Wireless.
We provide these services and equipment sales to consumer , business and government customers  in the United States on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Postpaid
connections represent individual lines of service for which a customer is billed in advance a monthly access charge in return for a monthly network service
allowance, and usage beyond the allowance is billed monthly in arrears. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit
verification by paying for all services in advance.
All financial results included in the tables below reflect the consolidated results of V erizon W ireless.

Accounts and Connections
Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primar ily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless
and use its branded services. Accounts include shared data plans, such as our new Verizon Plan and More Everything plans, and corporate accounts, as well as
legacy single  connection  plans and family plans. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. Retail connections
represent our retail customer device connections. Churn is the rate at which service to connections is terminated.(1)

Retail conne ctions under an account may include: smartphones and basic phones (collectively , phones) as well as tablets, LTE Internet (Installed) and other
connected devices. Retail postpaid connection net additions decreased during 2015 primarily due to a decrease in retail postpaid connection gross additions,
partially offset by lower retail postpaid connectio n churn rate. The decrease in retail postpaid connection gross additions during 2015 was driven by a decline in
gross additions of smartphones, tablets and other Internet devices.
Retail Postpaid Connections per Account
Retail postpaid connections per account is calculated by dividing the total number of retail postpaid connections by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of
the end of the period. Retail postpaid connections per account increased as of December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. The increase in retail postpaid
connections per account is primarily due to increases in Internet devices, which represented 16.8% of our retail postpaid connection base as of December 31,
2015, compared to 14.1% as of December 31, 2014.
Service Revenue
Service revenue, which does not include recurrin g device installment billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased by $2.2 billion, or 3.1%,
during 2015 primarily driven by lower retail postpaid service revenue. Retail postpaid service revenue was negatively impacted as a result of an increase in the
activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program on plans with unsubsi dized service pricing. The increase in these activations resulted
in a relative shift of revenue from service revenue to equipment revenue and caused a change in the timing of the recognition of revenue. At December 31, 2015,
approximately 29% of our retail postpaid phone connections participated in the Verizon device payment program compared to approximately 8% at December 31,
2014. At December 31, 2015, approximately 42% of our retail postpaid phone connections were on unsubsidized service pricing. The decrease in service revenue
was partially  offset by the impact of an increase in retail postpaid connections as well as the continued increase in penetration of smartphones and tablets through
our shared data plans. Service revenue plus recurring device installment billings related to the V erizon device payment program increased 2.0% during 2015.
Retail postpaid ARPA (the average revenue per account from retail postpaid accounts), which does not include recurring device installment billings related to the
Verizon device payment program, was negatively impacted during 2015 as a result of the increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device
payment program on plans with unsubsidized service pricing. Partially offsetting this impact during 2015 was an increase in our retail postpaid connections per
account, as discussed above.
Equipment Revenue
Equipment revenue increased by $6.0 billion, or 54.4%, during 2015 as a result of an increase in device sales, primarily smartphones, under the Verizon device
payment program, partially of fset by a decline in device sales under traditional fixed-term service plans. For the year ended December 31, 2015, phone activations
under the Verizon device payment program represented approximately 54% of retail postpaid phones activated compared to approximately 18% during 2014.
During the fourth quarte r of 2015, phone activations under the Verizon device payment progr am represented approximately 67% of retail postpaid phones
activated. The increase in these activations resulte d in a relative shift of revenue from service revenue to equipment revenue and caused a change in the timing of
the recogniti on of revenue. This shift in revenue  was the result of recognizing a higher amount of equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices under the
device payment program.
Other Revenue
Other revenue includes non-service revenues such as regulatory fees, cost recovery surchar ges, revenues associated with our device protection package, sublease
rentals and financing revenue. Other revenue increased $0.3 billion, or 7.5%, during 2015 prima rily due to a volume-driven increase in revenues related to our
device protection package.
2014 Compar ed to 2013
Wireless’ total operating revenues increased by $6.6 billion, or 8.2%, during 2014 primarily as a result of growth in service revenue and equipment revenue.
Accounts and Connections
Retail postpa id connectio n net additions increase d during 2014 primarily due to an increase in retail postpaid connection gross additions partially offset by an
increase in our retail postpaid connection churn rate. Higher retail postpaid connection gross additions were driven by gross additions of tablets as well as 4G L TE
smartphones. During 2014, our retail postpaid connection net additions included approximately 4.2 million tablets as compared to 1.4 million tablets in 2013.
Retail Postpaid Connections per Account
Retail postpaid connections per account increased 4.0% as of December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 primarily due to the increased penetration of
tablets.
Service Revenue
Service revenue, which does not include recurring device installment billings related to the Verizon device payment program, increased by $3.6 billion, or 5.2%,
during 2014 primarily driven by higher retail postpaid service revenue, which increased largely as a result of an increase in retail postpaid connections as well as
the continued  increase in penetration of 4G LTE smartphones and tablets through our More Everything plans. The penetration of 4G LTE smartphones was driven
by the activation of smartphones by new customers as well as existing customers migrating from basic phones and 3G smartphones to 4G L TE smartphones.
The increase in retail postpaid ARPA, which does not include recurring device installment billings related to the Verizon device payment program, during 2014
was primarily driven by increases in smartphone penetration and retail postpaid connections per account. As of December 31, 2014, we experienced a 4.0%
increase in retail postpaid connections per account compared to 2013, with smartphones represen ting 79% of our retail postpaid phone base as of December 31,
2014 compared to 70% as of December 31, 2013. The increased penetration in retail postpaid connections per account is primarily due to increases in Internet
data devices, which represented 14.1% of our retail postpaid connection base as of December 31, 2014 compared to 10.7% as of December 31, 2013, primarily
due to tablet activations. Additionally , during 2014, postpaid smartphone activations represented 92% of phones activated compared to 86% during 2013.
Other service revenue increased during 2014 due to growth in wholesale connections.
Equipment Revenue
Equipment revenue incre ased during 2014 prima rily due to an increase in device sales under both traditional fixed-term service plans and the Verizon device
payment program.

Cost of Services
Cost of services increase d $0.6 billion, or 8.4%, during 2015 primarily due to higher rent expense as a result of an increase in macro and small cell sites as well as
higher wirele ss network costs from an increase in fiber facilities supporting network capacity expansion and densification, including the deployment of small cell
technology , to meet growing customer demand for 4G LTE data services. Also contributing to the increase in Cost of services during 2015 was a volume-driven
increase in costs related to the device protection package of fered to our customers.
Cost of Equipment
Cost of equipment increa sed $1.5 billion, or 6.9%, during 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in the average cost per unit, driven by a shift to higher priced
units in the mix of devices sold, partially of fset by a decline in the number of units sold.
Cost of equipment increa sed during 2014 primarily due to an increase in cost of equipment sales of $5.3 billion as a result of an increase in the number of devices
sold as well as an increase in the cost per unit. The increase in the number of devices sold was driven, in part, by the launch of new devices.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, gene ral and administrative expense decreased during 2015 primarily due to a $2.8 billion decline in sales commission expense. The decline in sales
commission expense was driven by an increase in activations under the Verizon device payment program, which has a lower commission per unit than activations
under traditi onal fixed-term service plans, partiall y offset by an increase in bad debt expense. The increase in bad debt expense was primarily driven by a volume
increase in our device installment receivables, as the credit quality of our customers remained consistent throughout the periods presented.
Selling, gene ral and administrative expense incre ased during 2014 primarily due to a $0.2 billion increase in advertising expense and gains recorded in the first
quarter of 2013 related to wireless license exchan ge agreements, partially offset by a decline in sales commission expense, which was driven by the adoption of
the V erizon device payment program.
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
The increase in deprecia tion and amortization expense increased during 2015 and 2014, respectively , was primarily driven by an increase in net depreciable
assets.

 As of end of period
Wireline’ s revenues decreased $0.7 billion, or 1.8%, during 2015 primarily driven by declines in Global Enterprise, partially offset by higher Mass Markets
revenues driven by Fios services. Fios revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 8.6%, during 2015.
Mass Markets
Mass Markets operations provide broadband Internet and video services (including high-speed Internet, Fios Internet and Fios video services), local exchange
(basic service and end-user access) and long distance (including regional toll) voice services to residential and small business subscribers.
2015 Compar ed to 2014
Mass Marke ts revenues increased $0.4 billion, or 2.4%, during 2015 primarily due to the expans ion of Fios services (voice, Internet and video), including our
Fios Quantum of ferings, as well as changes in our pricing strategies, partially of fset by the continued decline of local exchange revenues.
During 2015, we grew our subscriber base by 0.4 million Fios Internet subscribers and by 0.2 million Fios video subscribers, while also improving the penetration
rate within our Fios service areas for Fios Internet. As of December 31, 2015, we achieved a penetration rate of 41.8% for Fios Internet compared to a penetration
rate of 41.1%  for Fios Internet as of December 31, 2014. During 2015, Consumer Fios revenue increased $1.0 billion, or 8.3%. Fios represented approximately
79% of Consumer retail revenue during 2015 compared to approximately 76% during 2014.(1)
(1)
The decline of local exchange revenues was primarily due to a 6.9% decline in Consumer retail voice connections resulting primarily from competition and
technology substitution with wireless, competing  VoIP and cable telephony services. Total voice connections include traditional switched access lines in service
as well as Fios digital voice connections. There was also a 7.1% decline in Small business retail voice connections, reflecting competition and a shift to both IP
and high-speed circuits, primarily in areas outside of our Fios footprint.
2014 Compar ed to 2013
Mass Marke ts revenues increased $0.7 billion, or 3.8%, during 2014 primarily due to the expans ion of Fios services (voice, Internet and video), including our
Fios Quantu m offerings, as well as changes in our pricing strategies, partially offset by the continued decline of local exchange revenues. Fios represented
approximately 76% of Consumer retail revenue during 2014 compared to approximately 71% during 2013.
During 2014 , we grew our subscriber base by 0.5 million Fios Internet subscribers and by 0.4 million Fios video subscribers, while also improving penetration
rates within our Fios service areas. As of December 31, 2014, we achieved penetration rates of 41.1% and 35.8% for Fios Internet and Fios video, respectively ,
compared to penetration rates of 39.5% and 35.0% for Fios Internet and Fios video, respectively , at December 31, 2013.
The increase in Mass Markets revenues was partially offset by the decline of local exchange revenues primarily due to a 5.5% decline in Consumer retail voice
connections resulting primarily from competiti on and technology substitution with wireless, competing VoIP and cable telephony services. Total voice
connections include traditional switched access lines in service as well as Fios digital voice connections. There was also a decline in Small business retail voice
connections, primarily reflecting competition and a shift to both IP and high-speed circuits.
Global Enterprise
Global Enterprise offers strategic services and other core communications services to medium and large business customers, multinational corporations and state
and federal government customers.
2015 Compar ed to 2014
Global Enterprise reven ues decreased $0.7 billion, or 5.2%, during 2015 primarily due to a $0.4 billion, or 11.7%, decline in core voice services and data
networking revenues, which consist of traditional circuit-based services such as frame relay , private line and legacy voice and data services. These core services
declined as a result of secular declines. Also contributing to the decrease were lower networking solutions revenues, a decline in customer premise equipment
revenues and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Networking solutions, which include Private IP, Public Internet, Ethernet and optical network
services, declined $0.2 billion, or 4.6%, as a result of competitive price compression.
2014 Compar ed to 2013
Global Enterprise revenues decreased $0.5 billion , or 3.6%, during 2014 primarily due to a decline  in voice services and data networking revenues, which consist
of traditional circuit-based services such as fram e relay , private line and legacy voice and data services. These core services declined as customers continued to
migrate to next generatio n IP services. Also contributing to the decrease was the contraction of market rates due to competition and a decline in Core customer
premise equipment reven ues. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in strategic services revenues of $0.2 billion, or 2.3%, primarily due to growth in
our application services, such as our cloud and data center of ferings and contract center solutions.
Global Wholesale
Global Who lesale provides communications services including data, voice and local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance and other
carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers.
2015 Compar ed to 2014
Global Wholesale revenues decreased $0.2 billio n, or 3.4%, during 2015 primarily due to declines in traditional voice revenues and data revenues driven by the
effect of technology substitution as well as continuing contraction of market rates due to competit ion. The decline in traditional voice revenue was primarily due
to a decrease in minutes of use (MOUs) driven by a 6.5% decline in domestic wholesale connections between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. As a
result of technology substitution, the number of core data circuits at December 31, 2015 experienced a 14.5% decline compared to December 31, 2014.
2014 Compar ed to 2013
Global Who lesale revenu es decreased $0.4 billio n, or 5.6%, during 2014 primarily due to a decline in data and traditional voice revenues. Data revenue declines
were driven by the continuing demand for high-speed digital data services from fiber-to-the-cell customers upgrading their core data circuits to Ethernet facilities.
As a result of the customer migrations, at December 31, 2014, the number of core data circuit s experienced a 14.2% decline. The traditional voice revenue
declines are primarily due to a decrease in MOU s and the effect of technology substitution. As of December 31, 2014, we also experienced a 6.2% decline in
domestic wholesale connections. Also contributing to the decline in voice revenues is the continuing contraction of market rates due to competition.

Cost of Services
Cost of services decreased during 2015 primarily due to a $0.3 billion decline in employee costs as a result of reduced headcount as well as a $0.3 billion decline
in access costs driven by declines in overall wholesale long distance volumes. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in content costs of $0.5 billion
associated with continued Fios subscriber growth and programming license fee increases.
Cost of services decreased slightly during 2014 primarily due to a decrease in employee costs as a result of reduced headcount and a decline in access costs driven
by declines in overall wholesale long distance volumes, which was partially offset by an increase in content costs of $0.4 billion associated with continued Fios
subscriber growth and programming license fee increases.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during 2015 primarily due to declines in employee costs as a result of reduced headcount and decreased
administrative expenses, partially of fset by an increase in transaction taxes and regulatory expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during 2014 primarily due to declines in employee costs as a result of reduced headcount, decreased
advertising expense and lower transaction and property taxes.
Depr eciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased  during 2015 primarily due to $0.9 billion of depreciation and amortization expense not being recorded on our
assets in California, Florida and T exas, which were classified as held for sale as of February 5, 2015, as well as decreases in net depreciable assets.
We will not record depreciation and amortization expense on our depreciable Wireline assets in California, Florida and Texas through the closing of the
transaction with Frontier , which is expected to occur at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2014 due to decreases in net depreciable assets.

During 2015 , we recorded net pre-tax severance,  pension and benefit credits of approximately $2.3 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which  they occur . The credits were primarily driven by an increase in
our discount rate assump tion used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2014 to a weighted-average of 4.6%
at December 31, 2015 ($2.5 billion), the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015 ($1.0 billion) and a change in mortality assumptions primarily
driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2015) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.9 billion), partially offset by the difference between our estimated
return on assets of 7.25% at December 31, 2014 and our actual return on assets of 0.7% at Decem ber 31, 2015 ($1.2 billion), severance costs recorded under our
existing separation plans ($0.6 billion) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion).
During 2014 , we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit charges of approximately $7.5 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which  they occur . The charges were primarily driven by a decrease in
our discount rate assump tion used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2013 to a weighted-average of 4.2%
at December  31, 2014 ($5.2 billion), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (RP-2014 and MP-2014) issued by
the Society of Actuaries in October 2014 ($1.8 billion) and revisions to the retirement assumptio ns for participants and other assumption adjustments, partially
offset by the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.25% and our actual return on assets of 10.5% ($0.6 billion). As part of this charge, we
recorded severance costs of $0.5 billion under our existing separation plans.
During 2013 , we recorded net pre-tax severance,  pension and benefit credits of approximately $6.2 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which  they occur . The credits were primarily driven by an increase in
our discount rate assump tion used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2012 to a weighted-average of 5.0%
at December 31, 2013 ($4.3 billion), lower than assumed retiree medical costs and other assumption adjustments ($1.4 billion) and the difference between our
estimated return on assets of 7.5% at December 31, 2012 and our actual return on assets of 8.6% at December 31, 2013 ($0.5 billion).
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Operating Income and EBITDA discussion (see “Consolidated Results of
Operations”) excludes the severance, pension and benefit (credits) char ges presented above.
 
Early Debt Redemption and Other Costs
During March 2014, we recorded net debt redemption costs of $0.9 billion in connection with the early redemption of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of
Cellco Partnership and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC 8.50% Notes due 2018, and the purchase of the following notes pursuant to the Tender Offer: $0.7 billion of
the then outstanding $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon 6.10% Notes due 2018, $0.8 billion of the then outstanding $1.5 billion aggregate

due 2018.
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Tender Of fer.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded net debt redemption costs of $0.5 billion in connection with the early redemption of $0.5 billion aggregate
principal amount of Verizon 4.90% Notes due 2015, $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon 5.55% Notes due 2016, $1.3 billion aggregate principal

We recognize early debt redemption costs in Other income and (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.
 
Gain on Spectrum License T ransactions
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a license exchange transaction with an affiliate of T-Mobile USA Inc. (T-Mobile USA) to exchange certain AWS
and Personal Communication Services (PCS) licenses. As a result of this non-cash exchange, we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair
value and we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.3 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the
year ended December 31, 2015.
During the second quarter of 2014, we complete d license exchange transactions with T-Mobile USA to exchange certain AWS and PCS licenses. The exchange
included a number of swaps that we expect will result in more efficient use of the AWS and PCS bands. As a result of these exchanges, we received $0.9 billion
of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded an immaterial gain.
During the second quarte r of 2014, we completed transactions pursuant to two additional agreements with T-Mobile USA with respect to our remaining 700 MHz
A block spectrum licens es. Under one agreement, we sold certain of these licenses to T-Mobile USA in exchange for cash consideration of approximately $2.4
billion, and under the second agreement we exchanged the remainder of our 700 MHz A block spectrum licenses as well as AWS and PCS spectrum licenses for
AWS and PCS spectrum  licenses. As a result, we received $1.6 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax gain of
approximately $0.7 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014.
During the third quarter of 2013, after receiving the required regulatory approvals, Verizon Wireless sold 39 lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses to AT&T
in exchange for a payment of $1.9 billion and the transfer by AT&T to Verizon Wireless of AWS (10 MHz) licenses in certain markets in the western United
States. Verizon Wireless also sold certain lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses to an investment firm for a payment of $0.2 billion. As a result, we received
$0.5 billion of AWS licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.3 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Operating Income and EBITDA discussion (see “Consolidated Results of
Operations”) excludes the gains on the spectrum license transactions described above.
 
Wireless T ransaction Costs
As a result of the third -party indebtedness incurred to finance the Wireless Transaction, we incurred interest expense of $0.4 billion during 2014 (see
“Consolidated Financial Condition”). This amount represents the interest expense incurred prior to the closing of the W ireless T ransaction.
During 2013, as a result of the Wireless Transaction, we recorded costs of $0.9 billion primarily for interest expense of $0.7 billion related to the issuance of the
new notes, as well as $0.2 billion in fees primarily in connection with the bridge credit agreement (see “Consolidated Financial Condition”).
 
Gain on Sale of Omnitel Inter est
As a result of the sale of the Omnitel Interest on February 21, 2014, which was part of the consideration for the Wireless Transaction, we recorded a gain of $1.9
billion in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated businesses on our consolidated statement of income during 2014.
 
Impact of Divested Operations
On July 1, 2014, we sold a non-strategic W ireline business that provides communications solutions to a variety of government agencies.
The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Operating Income and EBITDA discussion (see “Consolidated Results of
Operations”) excludes the historical financial results of the divested operations described above.

We use the net cash generated from our operations to fund network expansion and modernization, service and repay external financing, pay dividends, invest in
new businesses and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent
necessary , from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements. We expect that our capital spending
requirements will continue to be financed primari ly through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or
development activities or to maintain an appro priate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily held
domestically and are invested to maintain princip al and liquidity . Accordingly , we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. See “Market
Risk” for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.
Our available external financing arrangements include an active commercial paper program, credi t available under credit facilities and other bank lines of credit,
vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities and privately-placed capital market securities. In addition, in 2015, we established
an active program to sell selected device installment plan receivables under the Verizon device  payment program to a group of primarily relationship banks
(Purchasers).
 
Cash Flows Pr ovided By Operating Activities
Our primary  source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations, primarily from our Wireless segment. Net cash provided by operating activities
during 2015 increased by $8.3 billion primarily due to $5.9 billion of cash proceeds, net of remittances, related to the sale of wireless device installment
receivables as well as $2.4 billion of cash proceeds received related to the Tower Monetization Transaction attributable to the portion of the towers for which the
right-of-use has passed to the tower operator (see Note 2) as well as an increase in earnings at our W ireless segment.
During 2015, we establi shed an on-going progra m to sell from time to time, on an uncommitted basis, selected device installment plan receivables under the
Verizon device payment program to the Purchasers. Under the program, we transfer the receiva bles to wholly-owned subsidiaries that are bankruptcy remote
special purpo se entities (Sellers). The Sellers then sell the receivables to the Purchasers for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables
(the deferred  purchase price). The receivables sold under the program are no longer consider ed assets of Verizon. We continue to bill and collect on the
receivables in exchange for a monthly servicing fee, which is not material.
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2014 decreased by $8.2 billion due in part to a $3.7 billion increase in income tax payments due to the
incremental pre-tax income attributable to Verizon included in Verizon’ s income since the closing of the Wireless Transaction. Also contributing to the decrease
was a $2.3 billion increa se in interest payments primarily due to the incremental debt needed to fund the Wireless Transaction as well as a $1.5 billion increase in
pension contributions. The decrease in Cash flows provided by operating activities was partially of fset by an increase in earnings at our W ireless segment.
On February 21, 2014, we completed the Wireless Transaction which provides full access to the cash flows of Verizon Wireless. Having full access to all the cash
flows from our wireless business gives us the ability to continue to invest in our networks and spectrum, meet evolving customer requirements for products and
services and take advantage of new growth opportunities across our lines of business.
 
Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities
Capital Expenditur es
Capital expenditures continue to be a primary use of capital resources as they facilitate the introdu ction of new products and services, enhance responsiveness to
competitive challenges and increase the operating ef ficiency and productivity of our networks.
Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were as follows:
 
   (dollars in millions)   
Years Ended December 31,    2015      2014      2013   
  
Wireless   $    11,725     $    10,515     $      9,425

Total as a percentage of revenue    13.5%      13.5%      13.8%   
Capital expenditures increased at Wireless in 2015 and 2014 in order to increase the capacity of our 4G LTE network. Capital expenditures declined at Wireline in
2015 and 2014 as a result of decreased legacy spending requirements as well as decreased Fios spending requirements in 2015.
Acquisitions
During 2015 , 2014 and 2013, we invested $9.9 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively , in acquisitions of wireless licenses. During 2015, 2014 and
2013, we also invested $3.5 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively , in acquisitions of investments and businesses, net of cash acquired.
On January 29, 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum, which it identified as the AWS-3 band. Verizon participated in that auction, and was
the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion . During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made a deposit of $0.9
billion relate d to our participation in this auction, which is classified within Other , net investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2014. During the first quart er of 2015, we submitted an application to the FCC and paid $9.5 billion to the FCC to complete payment for
these licenses. The cash payment of $9.5 billion  is classified within Acquisitions of wireless licenses on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2015. On April 8, 2015, the FCC granted us these spectrum licenses.
On May 12, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with AOL pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. On June 23, 2015, we
completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL  became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing
of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion, net of cash acquired of $0.5 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised appraisal rights
under Delaware law. If they had not exercised these rights, Verizon would have paid an additio nal $330 million for such shares at closing. See Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In October 2015, AOL acquired an advertising technology business for cash consideration that was not significant.
In February 2014, V erizon acquired a business dedicated to the development of IP television for cash consideration that was not significant.
During the fourth quarte r of 2013, Verizon acquired an industry leader in content delivery networks for $0.4 billion. Additionally , we acquired a technology
company for cash consideration that was not significant.
Dispositions
During 2014 , we received proceeds of $2.4 billio n related to spectrum license transactions and $0.1 billion related to the disposition of a non-strategic Wireline
business. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
During 2013, we completed the sale of 700 MHz lower B block spectrum licenses and as a result, we received proceeds of $2.1 billion.
Other , net
On May 19, 2015, Verizon consummated a sale-l easeback transaction with a financial services firm for the buildings and real estate at our Basking Ridge, New
Jersey location. We received total gross proceed s of $0.7 billion resulting in a deferred gain of $0.4 billion, which will be amortized over the initial leaseback
term of twenty years. The leaseback of the buildings and real estate is accounted for as an operat ing lease. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction
have been classified within Other , net investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Also in 2015, Verizon received proceeds of $0.2 billion related
to a sale of real estate.
Cash Flows Pr ovided by (Used In) Financing Activities
We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable  rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, net cash
provided by (used in) financing activities was $(15.0) billion, $(57.7) billion and $26.5 billion, respectively .
2015
During 2015, our net cash used in financing activities of $15.0 billion was primarily driven by:
 
 • $9.3 billion used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations, including the repayment of $6.5 billion of borrowings under a
term loan agreement;
 
 • $8.5 billion used for dividend payments; and
 
 • $5.0 billion payment for our accelerated share repurchase agreement.
These uses of cash were  partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $6.7 billion,  which included $6.5 billion of borrowings under a term loan
agreement which was used for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of spectrum licenses, as well as $2.7 billion of cash proceeds received related
to the T ower Monetization T ransaction attributable to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations.
Proceeds fr om and Repayments of Long-T erm Borr owings
At December 31, 2015, our total debt decreased to $110.2 billion as compared to $113.3 billion at December 31, 2014. The substantial majority of our total debt
portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest rates do not have a material effect on our interest payments. See Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our debt activity .
At December 31, 2015, approximately $8.2 billion or 7.5% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt,
primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps in order  to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars
and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See “Market Risk” for additional information.
Verizon may continue to acquire debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates in the future through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions,
tender of fers, exchange of fers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as V erizon may from time to time determine for cash or other consideration.
Other , net
Other , net financing activities during 2015, inclu de $2.7 billion of cash proceeds received relate d to the Tower Monetization Transaction, which relates to the
portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations, partially of fset by the settlement of derivatives upon maturity for $0.4 billion.
Dividends
The Verizon  Board of Directors assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such factors as long-term growth
opportunities, internal cash requirements and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2015, the Board increased our quarterly dividend
payment 2.7% to $.565 per share from $.550 per share in the prior period. This is the ninth consecutive year that Verizon’ s Board of Directors has approved a
quarterly dividend increase.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2015, we paid $8.5 billion in dividends.
2014
During 2014, our net cash used in financing activities of $57.7 billion was primarily driven by:
 
 • $58.9 billion used to partially fund the W ireless T ransaction (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements);
 
 • $17.7 billion used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations; and
 
 • $7.8 billion used for dividend payments.
These uses of cash were partially of fset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $31.0 billion.
Proceeds fr om and Repayments of Long-T erm Borr owings
At December 31, 2014, our total debt increased to $113.3 billion as compared to $93.6 billion at December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of additional debt issued
to finance the W ireless Transaction. Since the substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate
indebtedness, changes in interest rates do not have a material effect on our interest payments. Throughout 2014, we accessed the capital markets to optimize the
maturity schedule of our debt portfolio and take advantage of lower interest rates, thereby reduc ing our effective interest rate to 4.9% from 5.2% in 2013. See
Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our debt activity .
At December 31, 2014, approximately $9.6 billion or 8.5% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt,
primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps in order  to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars
and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See “Market Risk” for additional information.
See “Other Items” for additional information related to the early debt redemption costs incurred in 2014.
Dividends
During the third quarter of 2014, the Board incre ased our quarterly dividend payment 3.8% to $.550 per share from $.530 per share in the same period of 2013.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2014,  we paid $7.8 billion in dividends compared to $5.9 billion in
2013. The increase is primarily due to the issuance of approximately 1.27 billion additional shares of common stock as a result of the W ireless T ransaction.
2013
During 2013 , our net cash provided by financing  activities of $26.5 billion was primarily driven by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $49.2 billion to fund
the W ireless T ransaction. This source of cash was partially of fset by:
 
 • $8.2 billion used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations;
 
 • $5.9 billion used for dividend payments; and
 
 • $3.2 billion used for a special distribution to a noncontrolling interest.
Proceeds fr om and Repayments of Long-T erm Borr owings
At December 31, 2013, our total debt increased to $93.6 billion as compared to $52.0 billion at December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of additional debt issued
to finance the Wireless Transaction. Since the substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness, changes in interest rates do not
have a material ef fect on our interest payments. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our debt activity .
Dividends
During the third quarter of 2013, the Board incre ased our quarterly dividend payment 2.9% to $.530 per share from $.515 per share in the same period of 2012.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources.
Special Distributions
In May 2013, the Board of Representatives of Verizon Wireless declared a distribution to its owne rs, which was paid in the second quarter of 2013 in proportion
to their partnership interests on the payment date, in the aggregate amount of $7.0 billion. As a result, Vodafone received a cash payment of $3.15 billion and the
remainder of the distribution was received by V erizon.
Other , net
The change in Other , net financing activities durin g 2013 was primarily driven by higher distributi ons to Vodafone, which owned a 45% noncontrolling interest in
Verizon W ireless as of December 31, 2013.
Credit Facility
As of December 31, 2015, the unused borrowing  capacity under our $8.0 billion four-year credit facility was approximately $7.9 billion. The credit facility does
not require us to comply with financial covenan ts or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material
adverse change. W e use the credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit and for general corporate purposes.
Common Stock
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements  of employee and shareholder plans, including 22.6 million,
18.2 million  and 6.9 million common shares issued from Treasury stock during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively , which had aggregate values of $0.9 billion,
$0.7 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively .
In February 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion of
the Compan y’s common stock. On February 10, 2015, in exchange for an upfront payment totaling $5.0 billion, Verizon received an initial delivery of
86.2 million shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion. On June 5, 2015, Verizon received an additional 15.4 million shares as final settlement of the
transaction under the ASR agreement. In total, 101.6 million shares were delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $49.21.
On March 7, 2014, the Verizon Board of Directors approved a share buyback program, which authorizes the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of Verizon
common stock terminati ng no later than the close of business on February 28, 2017. The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the
amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. The Board also determined that no additional shares were to be
purchased under the prior program. During 2015, we repurchased $0.1 billion of our common stock as part of our previously announced share buyback program.
There were no repurchases of common stock during 2014. During 2013, we repurchased $0.2 billion of our common stock under our previous share buyback
program.
As a result of the W ireless T ransaction, in February 2014, V erizon issued approximately 1.27 billion shares.
Credit Ratings
Verizon’ s credit ratings did not change in 2015 or 2014.
During the third quarter  of 2013, Verizon’ s credit ratings were downgraded by Moody’ s Inves tors Service (Moody’ s), Standard & Poor ’s Ratings Services
(Standard & Poor ’s) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) as a result of Verizon’ s announcement of the agreement to acquire Vodafone’ s 45% noncontrolling interest in
Verizon Wireless for approximately $130 billion including the incurrence of third-party indebtedness to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the
Wireless Transaction. Moody’ s downgraded Verizon’ s long-term debt ratings one notch from A3 to Baa1, while Standard & Poor ’s lowered its corporate credit
rating and senior unsecured debt rating one notch from A- to BBB+ and Fitch lowered its long-term issuer default rating and senior unsecured debt rating one
notch from A to A-.
Securities ratings assigned by rating organization s are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is
subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating or ganization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Covenants
Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay interest and
principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep
appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain our properties, provide financial  and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition
of assets and mergers and consolidations, and other similar covenants. Additionally , our term loan credit agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (as
such term is defined in those agreements) not in excess of 3.50:1.00 until our credit ratings are equal to or higher than A3 and A-. See Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional details related to our term loan credit agreement.
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our financial and restrictive covenants.
 
Increase (Decr ease) In Cash and Cash Equivalents
Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 totaled $4.5 billion, a $6.1 billion decrease compared to Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014
primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 totaled $10.6 billion, a $42.9 billion decrease compared
to Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of the cash payment made to Vodafone as part of the completion of the Wireless
Transaction.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure  that management believes is useful to investors and other users of Verizon’ s financial information in evaluating
cash availab le to pay debt and dividends. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities. The
following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to Free cash flow:

The changes in free cash flow during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were a result of the factors described in connection with net cash provided by operating activities and
capital expenditures. During 2015, we received $5.9 billion of cash proceeds, net of remittances, related to the sale of wireless device installment receivables as
well as $2.4 billion of cash proceeds received related to the Tower Monetization Transaction attributable to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use
has passed to the tower operator . On February 21, 2014, we completed the Wireless Transaction which provides full access to the cash flows of Verizon Wireless.
The completion of the Wireless Transaction resulted in an increase in income tax payments as well as an increase in interest payments, which reduced our net
cash provided by operating activities during 2014 (see “Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities”).
 
Employee Benefit Plan Funded Status and Contributions
Employer Contributions
We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units.
During 2015 and 2014, contributions to our qualified pension plans were $0.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively . During 2013, contributions to our qualified
pension plans were not material. We also contributed $0.1 billion, $0.1 billion and $0.1 billion  to our nonqualified pension plans in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively .
In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to
better match  cash flows from investments with projected benefit payments. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time
when liabilit ies increase  (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries,
however , we also expect the strategy to result in lower asset returns. Based on this strategy and the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2015, we expect the
minimum required qualified pension plan contri bution in 2016 to be $0.6 billion. Nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately $0.1
billion in 2016.
Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since the other postretirement benefit
plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $0.9 billion, $0.7 billion and $1.4 billion to our other postretirement benefit
plans in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively . Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $0.9 billion in 2016.

 The purchase obligations reflected above are primarily commitments to purchase programming and network services, equipment, software, handsets and
peripherals, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated
purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligation s. We also purchase products and services as needed with no
firm commit ment. For this reason, the amounts presented in this table alone do not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes
in our expected cash position (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
 
 Other long-term liabilities include estimated postretirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements).
 
 Represents future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement for our tower transaction (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
We are not able to make a reliable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $1.6 billion and related interest and penalties will be settled with the
respective taxing authorities until issues or examinations are further developed (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).
 
Guarantees
We guarantee the debentures and first mortgage bonds of our operating telephone company subsidiaries as well as the debt obligations of GTE Corporation that
were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the
purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses (see Note 16 to the
consolidated financial statements).
As of December 31, 2015, letters of credit totaling approximately $0.1 billion, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several
financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
 
Market Risk
We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include
the use of a variety of derivatives including cross  currency swaps, foreign currency and prepaid forwards and collars, interest rate swap agreements, commodity
swap and forward agreements and interest rate locks. W e do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
It is our gene ral policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives
in optimizing exposure to various market risks.  Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within
reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk
exposure in a manner that would completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings. At December 31, 2015
and 2014, we posted collateral of approximately $0.1 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively , related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements.
During the first and second quarter of 2015, we paid an immaterial amount of cash to enter into amendments to certain collateral exchange arrangements. These
amendments suspend cash collateral posting for a specified period of time by both counterpa rties. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the
nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote. As such, we do not expect that our results of operations or financial condition will be
materially af fected by these risk management strategies.
 
Inter est Rate Risk
We are exposed to chan ges in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. As of
December 31, 2015, approximately 81% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfo lio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, including the effect of
interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges. The impact of a 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a
change in annual interest expense, including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated  as hedges, of approximately $0.2 billion. The interest rates on
substantially all of our existing long-term debt obligations are unaf fected by changes to our credit ratings.
The table that follows summarizes the fair values  of our long-term debt, including current maturit ies, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2015
and 2014. The table also provides a sensitivity  analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point upward and
downward shifts in the yield curve. Our sensitivi ty analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not
significantly af fected by changes in market interest rates.(3)

At December 31, 2014    126,139      115,695      138,420   
Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into domestic interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates based
on LIBOR, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against changes in the fair value
of our debt portfolio. W e record the interest rate swaps at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities.
During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $3.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into
interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $2.6 billion. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $7.6 billion
and $1.8 billion, respecti vely. The fair value of these contracts was $0.1 billion at December 31, 2015 and was not material at December 31, 2014. The ineffective
portion of these interest rate swaps was not material at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
Forwar d Inter est Rate Swaps
In order to manage our exposure to future intere st rate changes, we have entered into forward interest rate swaps. We designated these contracts as cash flow
hedges. At December 31, 2014, these swaps had a notional value of $2.0 billion. The fair value of these contracts was $0.2 billion at December 31, 2014, which
was included  within Other liabilities on our conso lidated balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2015, we settled these forward interest rate swaps and the pre-
tax loss was not material . During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into forward interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.8 billion. The fair value of
these contracts was not material at December 31, 2015.
 
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
The function al currency for our foreign operation s is primarily the local currency . The translation of income statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign
operations into U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in our
consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income in Other income and
(expense), net. At December 31, 2015, our primary translation exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar .
Cross Curr ency Swaps
Verizon Wireless previously entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $1.6 billion of British Pound Sterling
and Euro-denominated debt into U.S. dollars and to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign
currency transaction gains or losses. In June 2014, we settled $0.8 billion of these cross currency swaps and the gains with respect to these swaps were not
material. In December 2015, we settled $0.6 billion of these cross currency swaps on maturity .
During the first quarter of 2014, we entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $5.4 billion of Euro and British
Pound Sterling denominated debt into U.S. dollars. During the second quarter of 2014, we entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to
exchange approximately  $1.2 billion of British Pound Sterling denominated debt into U.S. dollars. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into cross
currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $3.0 billion of Euro denominated debt into U.S. dollars and to fix our future interest
and principal payments in U.S. dollars. Each of these cross currency swaps was entered into in order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains
or losses.
A portion of the gains and losses recognized in Other comprehensive income was reclassified to Other income and (expense), net to offset the related pre-tax
foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying debt obligations. The fair value of the outstanding swaps was $1.6 billion and $0.6 billion, which was
primarily included within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively . At December 31, 2015, the total
notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $9.7 billion. During 2015 and 2014, a pre-tax loss of $1.2 billion and a pre-tax loss of $0.1 billion, respectively ,
was recognized in Other comprehensive income with respect to these swaps.
Net Investment Hedges
We entered into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar
net investme nts in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into net investment hedges
with a total notional value of $0.9 billion with the contract tenor maturing in 2018. The fair value of these contracts was not material at December 31, 2015.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued  Accounting Standards
 
Critical Accounting Estimates
A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements is as follows:
 
• Wireless licenses and Goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived
intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter , unless there are events requiring an
earlier asses sment or changes in circumstances during an interim period that indicate these assets may not be recoverable. We believe our estimates and
assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in
developing the assumptions and estimates underl ying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can
vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be changes in our assumptions, including estimated cash flow projections, margins, growth
rates and discount rate, which could result in dif ferent fair value estimates and an impairment char ge.
Wireless Licenses
The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $86.6 billion as of December 31, 2015. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit
of accountin g, as we utilize our wireless licenses  on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the
exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual,
competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses.
In 2015, our quantitative  impairment test consiste d of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount
as of the test date. If the estimated fair value of our aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses then an
impairment charge would have been recognized.  Our quantitative impairment test for 2015 indicated that the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying
value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
In 2015, using a quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an
income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that
goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant
would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregate d wireless licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were required to make significant estimates about
future cash flows specifically associated with our wireless licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows
and assumed  terminal value and growth rates. We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless
network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash flows. The
discount rate represented our estimate of the weig hted-average cost of capital (WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required
as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the
valuation date. Accordin gly, our discount rate incorporated our estimate of the expected return a marketplace participant would have required as of the
valuation date, including the risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation date. The terminal value growth
rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’ s long-term growth rate.
In 2014 and 2013, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses
was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of Wireless,
macroeconomic conditio ns (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and
EBITDA margin projections), the projected financial performance of Wireless, as well as other factors. Based on our assessment in 2014 and 2013, we
qualitatively concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses significantly exceeded their carrying value and therefore, did
not result in an impairment.
Goodwill
At December 31, 2015, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $25.3 billion, of which $18.4 billion was in our Wireless reporting unit, $4.3 billion
was in our Wireline reporting unit and $2.6 billion was in our other reporting unit. Determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the
determination of fair value of each respective reporting unit. The fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying values. Accordingly , our annual
impairment tests for 2015, 2014 and 2013 did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units, the fair
value would have still exceeded the book value of the reporting unit and no impairment char ge would be recorded.
The fair value of the reporting unit is calculate d using a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market approach includes the use of
comparative multiples to corroborate discounted  cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components—
projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows
from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete
period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the WACC, or expected return, that a marketplace participant
would have required as of the valuation date.
• We maintain  benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2015,
in the aggregate, pension plan benefit obligations  exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets, which will result in higher future pension plan expense. Other
postretirement benefit plans have larger benefit obligations than plan assets, resulting in expense. Significant benefit plan assumptions, including the discount
rate used, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact
the amount of benefit plan income, expense, asset s and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for
pension and other postretirement benefits. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefit obligations and expense (income)
recorded, as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2015 and for
the year then ended pertaining to V erizon’ s pension and postretirement benefit plans is provided in the table below .

 *In determining its pensi on and other postretirem ent obligation, the Company used a weighted-average discount rate of 4.6%. The rate was selected to
approximate the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2015. The bonds selected
had maturities that coinc ided with the time periods during which benefits payments are expected to occur , were non-callable and available in sufficient
quantities to ensure marketability (at least $0.3 billion par outstanding).
The annual measurement date for both our pensi on and other postretirement benefits is December 31. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted the full yield
curve approach to estim ate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. We will account for this
change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly , will account for it prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Prior to this change, we
estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at
the beginning of the period.
The full yield curve approach refines our estimat e of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on
several hundred high-quality , fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future
cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.
This change in accountin g estimate does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligatio ns at year end or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the
change in the interest cost is offset in the actuarial gain or loss recorded at year end. Accordingly , this change in accounting estimate has no impact on our
annual conso lidated GAAP results. We estimate the impact of this change on our consolidated GAAP results for the first quarter of 2016 will be a reduction of
the interest cost compon ent of net periodic benefit cost and an increase to Net income by appro ximately $0.1 billion. However , at this time the estimated
impact of this change on the remaining 2016 interim periods and for annual 2016 results cannot be reasonably estimated because it is possible that in the future
there may be changes to underlying assumptions, including an interim remeasurement of our benefit obligations, which could result in different estimates. Our
non-GAAP measure for segment EBITDA is unaffected because net periodic benefit costs are not included in our segment results. For additional discussion of
Non-GAAP measures and non-operational items see “Consolidated Results of Operations”.
 
• Our current and deferred income taxes, and associated valuation allowances, are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business
as well as in connection  with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-
recurring items. As a global commercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including
estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or
expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-
step approac h for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax
benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances, and information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of
these tax positions is dif ferent than thest
 amounts recorded, such differences may impact  income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well
as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances.
 
• Our Plant, property and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record Plant, property and equipment at cost. We
depreciate Plant, propert y and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We expect that a one-year increase in estimated
useful lives of our Plant, property and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2015 depreciation expense of $2.8 billion and that a one-year decrease
would result in an increase of approximately $7.2 billion in our 2015 depreciation expense.
 
• We maintain  allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our device installment plan receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure
or inability of our custom ers to make required payments. Our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on management’ s assessment of the
collectability of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. We record an
allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on
multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment  and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration
of customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our
allowance for doubtful accounts, which would af fect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standard updates not yet adopted as of December 31, 2015.
 
Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Wireless
Wireless T ransaction
On February  21, 2014, we completed the Wireles s Transaction for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion. The consideration paid was primarily
comprised of cash of approximately $58.89 billion, V erizon common stock with a value of approximately $61.3 billion and other consideration.
Omnitel T ransaction
On February 21, 2014, Verizon and Vodafone also consummated the sale of the Omnitel Intere st (the Omnitel Transaction) by a subsidiary of Verizon to a
subsidiary of Vodafone in connection with the Wireless Transaction pursuant to a separate share purchase agreement. As a result, during 2014, we recognized a
pre-tax gain of $1.9 billion on the disposal of the Omnitel interest.
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the W ireless T ransaction.
Spectrum License T ransactions
In January 2015, the FCC completed an auction  of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band. We participated in the auction and were the high bidder on 181
spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015.
From time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to
continue to enhance the reliability of our network  while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional details regarding our spectrum license transactions.
Tower Monetization T ransaction
During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower pursuant to which Ame rican Tower acquired the exclusive right to lease, acquire or
otherwise operate and manage many of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.1 billion , which also included payment for the sale of 162 towers. See
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Wireline
During July 2014, Verizon sold a non-strategic  Wireline business for cash consideration that was not significant. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.
Access Line Sale
On February 5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier  pursuant to which Verizon will sell its local exchange business
and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed
Internet service and long distance voice accounts  in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.5 billion net of income taxes), subject to
certain adjus tments and including the assumption  of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier . We expect this transaction to close at the end of the
first quarter of 2016. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Other
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
On May 12, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with AOL pursuant to which we comm enced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by
Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised their appraisal rights under
Delaware law . If they had not exercised these rights, V erizon would have paid an additional $330 million for such shares at the closing.
AOL is a leader in the digital content and advertising platform space. Verizon has been investing in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital
content and advertising. AOL ’s business model aligns with this approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a
digital advertising platform enhances our ability  to further develop future revenue streams. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm on Internal Contr ol Over Financial Reporting
To The Board of Dir ectors and Shar eowners of V erizon Communications Inc.:
We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria
established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the
COSO criteria). V erizon’ s management is responsible for maintaining ef fective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the ef fectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the company’ s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. W e believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of record s that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that recei pts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Verizon maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over finan cial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO
criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Over sight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Verizon as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and our report dated February 23, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

statements based on our audits.
We conducte d our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Verizon at December 31,

Note 1
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Verizon Com munications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’ s leading providers of
communications, informa tion and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies with a presence around the world. We
have two reportable segments, W ireless and W ireline. For further information concerning our business segments, see Note 13.
The Wireless segment provides wireless communications products and services across one of the most extensive and reliable wireless networks in the United
States (U.S.)  and has the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-T erm Evolution (LTE) technology and third-generation (3G) networks of any U.S. wireless service
provider .
The W ireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, including broadband video and data, corporate networking
solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and
services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world.
Consolidation
The method of accountin g applied to investmen ts, whether consolidated, equity or cost, involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that
explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements include our controlled
subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary . For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned,
the noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and Total equity . Investments in businesses which we do not control, but have the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial  policies, are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we do not have the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for under the cost method. Equity and cost method investments are included in
Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Basis of Pr esentation
We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
Use of Estimates
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require management to make estimates and assumptions
that af fect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could dif fer from those estimates.
Examples of significant estimates include: the allowance for doubtful accounts, the recoverab ility of plant, property and equipment, the recoverability of
intangible assets and other long-lived assets, fair values of financial instruments, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, accrued expenses,
pension and postretirement benefit assumptions , contingencies and the identification of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business
combinations.
Revenue Recognition
Multiple Deliverable Arrangements
We offer products and services to our wireless and wireline customers through bundled arrangem ents. These arrangements involve multiple deliverables which
may include products, services, or a combination of products and services.
Wireless
Our Wireless segment earns revenue primarily by providing access to and usage of its network as well as the sale of equipment. In general, access revenue is
billed one month in adva nce and recognized when earned. Usage revenue is generally billed in arrears and recognized when service is rendered. Equipment sales
revenue associated with the sale of wireless devices and accessories is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer , as
this is consid ered to be a separate earnings proce ss from providing wireless services. For agreements involving the resale of third-party services in which we are
considered the primary obligor in the arrangements, we record the revenue gross at the time of the sale.
Under the Verizon device  payment program (form erly known as Verizon Edge), our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or tablets at unsubsidized prices
on an install ment basis (a device installment plan). Certain devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down
the minimum  percentage  of the device installment plan and trading in their device. When a custom er has the right to upgrade to a new device by paying down the
minimum percentage of the device installment plan and trading in their device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the
trade-in right’ s fair value (not an allocated value) is recognized as a guarantee liability and the remaining allocable consideration is allocated to the device. The
value of the guarantee liability ef fectively results in a reduction to the revenue recognized for the sale of the device.
In multiple element arran gements that bundle devices and monthly wireless service, revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting using a relative selling price
method. At the inception  of the arrangement, the amount allocable to the delivered units of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the
delivery of the monthly wireless service (the noncontingent amount). We effectively recognize revenue on the delivered device at the lesser of the amount
allocated based on the relative selling price of the device or the noncontingent amount owed when the device is sold.
Wireline
Our Wireline segment earns revenue based upon usage of its network and facilities and contract fees. In general, fixed monthly fees for voice, video, data and
certain other  services are billed one month in advance and recognized when earned. Revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and are based on usage is
generally billed in arrears and recognized when service is rendered.
We sell each of the servic es offered in bundled arrangements (i.e., voice, video and data), as well as separately; therefore each product or service has a standalone
selling price. For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each deliverable using a relative sellin g price method. Under this method, arrangement consideration
is allocated to each separ ate deliverable based on our standalone selling price for each product or service. These services include Fios services, individually or in
bundles, and High Speed Internet.
When we bundle equipm ent with maintenance and monitoring services, we recognize equipment revenue when the equipment is installed in accordance with
contractual specifications and ready for the customer ’s use. The maintenance and monitoring services are recognized monthly over the term of the contract as we
provide the services.
Installation-related fees, along with the associated costs up to but not exceeding these fees, are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer relationship
period.
Other
Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising revenue is generated by the display of graphical
advertisements and other performance-based advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated when a consumer clicks on a text-based advertisement on their
screen. Agreements for advertising typically take the forms of impression-based contracts, time-based contracts or performance-based contracts. Advertising
revenues derived from impression-based contracts, in which we provide impressions in exchange for a fixed fee, are generally recognized as the impressions are
delivered. Advertising revenues derived from time-based contracts, in which we provide promotions over a specified time period for a fixed fee, are recognized
on a straight -line basis over the term of the contract, provided that we meet and will continue to meet our obligations under the contract. Advertising revenues
derived from contracts where we are compensated based on certain performance criteria are recognized as we complete the contractually specified performance.
We report taxes imposed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions between us and our customers on a net basis.
Maintenance and Repairs
We charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services
as these costs are incurred.
Advertising Costs
Costs for advertising products and services as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the
periods in which they are incurred (see Note 15).
Earnings Per Common Shar e
Basic earnings per comm on share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per
common share include the dilutive ef fect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans.
There were a total of approximately 8 million, 7 million and 8 million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the
computation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively . For the year ended December 31, 2015,
there were no outstandin g options to purchase shares that would have been anti-dilutive. Outstanding options to purchase shares that were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per common share, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the period, were not significant for the years ended
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively .
On January 28, 2014, at a special meeting of our shareholders, we received shareholder approval to increase our authorized shares of common stock by 2 billion
shares to an aggregate of 6.25 billion authorized shares of common stock. On February 4, 2014, this authorization became effective. On February 21, 2014, we
issued appro ximately 1.27 billion shares of common stock upon completing the acquisition of Vodafone Group Plc’s indirect 45% interest in Cellco Partnership
d/b/a V erizon W ireless. See Note 2 for additional information.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider  all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates quoted market value and include amounts held in money market funds.
Marketable Securities
We have investments in marketable securities, which are considered “available-for -sale” under the provisions of the accounting standard for certain debt and
equity securities, and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in Short-te rm investments or Other assets. We continually evaluate our
investments in marketable securities for impairment due to declines in market value considered to be other -than-temporary . That evaluation includes, in addition
to persistent, declining stock prices, general econ omic and company-specific evaluations. In the event of a determination that a decline in market value is other -
than-temporary , a char ge to earnings is recorded for the loss, and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are recorded in the consolid ated financial statements at cost net of an allowance for credit losses. We maintain allowances for uncollectible
accounts receivable, including our device installment plan receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make
required payments. Similar to traditional service revenue accounting treatment, we record device  installment plan bad debt expense based on an estimate of the
percentage of equipment revenue that will not be collected. This estimate is based on a number of factors including historical write-of f experience, credit quality
of the customer base and other factors such as macroeconomic conditions. Due to the device installment plan being incorporated in the standard Verizon Wireless
bill, the colle ction and risk strategies continue to follow historical practices. We monitor the aging of our accounts with device installment plan receivables and
write of f account balances if collection ef forts are unsuccessful and future collection is unlikely .
Inventories
Inventory consists of wireless and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost (determined principally on either an average cost or first-
in, first-out basis) or market.
Plant and Depr eciation
We record plant, property and equipment at cost. Plant, property and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the
time the asset was placed in service.
When depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the plant accounts, and any gains
or losses on disposition are recognized in income.
We capitalize and deprec iate network software purchased or developed along with related plant assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the acquisition
or construction of netwo rk-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in intere st expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-
related assets.
In connection with our ongoing review of the estimated remaining average useful lives of plant, property and equipment, we determined that changes were
necessary to the remaining estimated useful lives of certain assets as a result of technology upgrades, enhancements, and planned retirements. These changes
resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively . While the timing and extent of current deployment
plans are subject to ongoing analysis and modification, we believe the current estimates of useful lives are reasonable.
Computer Softwar e Costs
We capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software that has a useful life in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications or
upgrades to internal-use network and non-networ k software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not
perform. Planning, softw are maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Also, we capitalize interest associated with the
development of internal-use network and non-net work software. Capitalized non-network internal-use software costs are amortized using the straight-line method
over a period of 3 to 8 years and are included in Other intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. For a discussion of our impairment policy for
capitalized software costs, see “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” below . Also, see Note 3 for additional detail of internal-use non-network software
reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed
annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option
to perform a qualitative assessment. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform an impairment test even if no indications of a
potential impairment exist. The impairment test for goodwill uses a two-step approach, which is performed at the reporting unit level. Step one, performed to
identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a market approach and/or a discounted cash flow method) to its
carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed to measure the amount of the
impairment charge. Step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its implied fair value (i.e., fair value of reporting unit less the fair
value of the unit’s assets and liabilities, including  identifiable intangible assets). If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill,
an impairment char ge is recognized.
Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization
A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio
frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years, such licenses are subject to
renewal by the Federal Communications Commis sion (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover , we have determined that
there are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat
the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. W e reevaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events
and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life.
We test our wireless licenses for potential impai rment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a
qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However , we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment
in any period and procee d directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. The most recent quantitative assessment of our wireless licenses occurred in
2015. Our quantitative assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the
test date. Using a quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach
is an income based valua tion approach that value s the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that
goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant
would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less
than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses then an impairment charge is recogn ized. In 2014 and 2013, we performed a qualitative assessment
to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment, we
considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our Wireless segment, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest
rates and discount rates ), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization) mar gin projections), the projected financial performance of our W ireless segment, as well as other factors.
Interest expense incurred while qualifying activit ies are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The
capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially complete and the license is ready for its intended use.
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets
Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful
lives. All of our intangib le assets subject to amortization and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount  of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications were present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount
of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the
carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We reevaluate the useful life
determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.
For information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives
of our other acquired intangible assets, see Note 3.
Fair V alue Measur ements
Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction betw een market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the
inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3—No observable pricing inputs in the market
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our
assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities
being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy .
Income T axes
Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various
jurisdictions in which we operate.
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the bases between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income
taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates then in effect. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than
not to be realized.
We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine
whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-like ly-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position
will be exam ined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that
meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is
measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken
in a tax return and amou nts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes
payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset, or an increase in a deferred tax liability .
The accounting standard relating to income taxes generated by leveraged lease transactions requires that changes in the projected timing of income tax cash flows
generated by a leveraged lease transaction be recognized as a gain or loss in the year in which the change occurs.
Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our ef fective tax rate.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure and recogni ze compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See
Note 10 for further details.
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation
The function al currency of our foreign operation s is generally the local currency . For these foreign entities, we translate income statement amounts at average
exchange rates for the period, and we translate assets and liabilities at end-of-period exchange rates. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated
other comprehensive income, a separate compon ent of Equity , in our consolidated balance sheets. We report exchange gains and losses on intercompany foreign
currency transactions of a long-term nature in Accumulated other comprehensive income. Other exchange gains and losses are reported in income.
Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year as well as interest on projected benefit obligations are accrued currently .
Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees
expected to receive bene fits. Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the retur n on assets assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in operating results in the year in which they occur . These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or
upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the company retiree medical subsidy (see
Note 1 1).
We recogniz e a pension or a postretirement plan’ s funded status as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we measure any
unrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accum ulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income
tax.
Derivative Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign  currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity and commodity
prices. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, foreign currency and
prepaid forw ards and collars, interest rate swap agreements, commodity swap and forward agreements and interest rate locks. We do not hold derivatives for
trading purposes.
We measure all derivativ es, including derivatives embedded in other financial instruments, at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities on our
consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative instru ments are valued primarily using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms
of our derivative contrac ts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments not qualifying as hedges or any ineffective
portion of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments used effectively as fair value hedges are
recognized in earnings, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of the effective portions of cash flow hedges are
reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the
effective portion of net investment hedges of certain of our foreign operations are reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative
translation adjustment and partially of fset the impact of foreign currency changes on the value of our net investment.
Variable Inter est Entities
VIEs are entities which lack suf ficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, have
equity investors which do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’ s operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to
absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity . We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are
deemed to be the primary  beneficiary . The primar y beneficiary is the party which has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic
performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
During the first quarter of 2015, we adopted the accounting standard update related to the repor ting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of
components of an entity , which changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. As a result of this standard update, a disposal of a component of an
entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a
major effect on an entity ’s operations and financi al results. The prospective adoption of this standa rd update did not have an impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we early adopted the accounting standard update related to the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. The standard
update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position. We applied the amendments in this
accounting standard update retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this standard update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In September 2015, the accounting standard update related to the simplification of the accounting for measurement-period adjustments in business combinations
was issued. This standa rd update requires an acquirer to recognize measurement-period adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustments are
determined and to record the effects on earnings of any changes resulting from the change in provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been
completed at the acquisition date. We will adopt this standard update during the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have
a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2015 , the accounting standard update related to disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share was issued. This
standard update removes  the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value
per share practical exped ient. The standard updat e also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at
fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. We will adopt this standard updat e during the first quarter of 2016 and apply it retrospectively to
all periods presented. The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In April 2015, the accoun ting standard update related to the simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs was issued. This standard update requires that
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability . In
August 2015 , the accounting standard update related to the presentation and subsequent meas urement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit
arrangements was issued. This standard adds Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paragraphs pursuant to an SEC Staff Announcement that the SEC staff
would not object to an entity deferring and presen ting debt issuance costs associated with a line-of -credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the
costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. W e will adopt these standard updates during the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of these standard updates is not
expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2014, an accou nting standard update was issued related to the accounting for share- based payments when the terms of an award provide that a
performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The standard update requi res that a performance target that affects vesting and that could
be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. We will adopt this standard update during the first quarter of 2016. The
adoption of this standard update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the accounting standard update related to the recognition of revenue from contracts  with customers was issued. This standard update clarifies the
principles for recognizing revenue and develops  a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The standard
update intends to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities,
industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; and provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements.
Upon adopti on of this standard update, we expec t that the allocation and timing of revenue recognition will be impacted. In August 2015, an accounting standard
update was issued that delays the effective date of this standard until the first quarter of 2018. Companies are permitted to early adopt the standard in the first
quarter of 2017.
There are two adoption methods available for implementation of the standard update related to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under
one method,  the guidance is applied retrospectively to contracts for each reporting period presen ted, subject to allowable practical expedients. Under the other
method, the guidance is applied only to the most current period presented, recognizing the cumulative effect of the change as an adjustment to the beginning
balance of retained earnings, and also requires additional disclosures comparing the results to the previous guidance. We are currently evaluating these adoption
methods and the impact that this standard update will have on our consolidated financial statements.
 
Note 2
Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Wireless
Wireless T ransaction
On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) with Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) and Vodafone 4
Limited (Seller), pursuan t to which Verizon agreed to acquire Vodafone’ s indirect 45% interest in Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless (the Partnership, and
such interest, the V odafone Interest) for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion.
On February 21, 2014, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired (the Wireless Transaction)
from Seller all of the issued and outstanding capital stock (the Transferred Shares) of Vodafone Americas Finance 1 Inc., a subsidiary of Seller (VF1 Inc.), which
indirectly through certain subsidiaries (together with VF1 Inc., the Purchased Entities) owned the Vodafone Interest. In consideration for the Transferred Shares,
upon completion of the Wireless Transaction, Verizon (i) paid approximately $58.89 billion in cash, (ii) issued approximately 1.27 billion shares of Verizon’ s
common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the Stock Consideration), which was valued at approximately $61.3 billion at the closing of the Wireless Transaction,
(iii) issued senior unsec ured Verizon notes in an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion (the Verizon Notes), (iv) sold Verizon’ s indirectly owned 23.1%
interest in Vodafone Omnitel N.V. (Omnitel, and such interest, the Omnitel Interest), valued at $3.5 billion and (v) provided other consideration, which included
the assumption of preferred stock valued at approximately $1.7 billion. The total cash paid to Vodafone and the other costs of the Wireless Transaction, including
financing, legal and bank fees, were financed through the incurrence of third-party indebtedness. See Note 7 for additional information.
In accordance with the accounting standard on consolidation, a change in a parent’ s ownership interest while the parent retains a controlling financial interest in
its subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and remeasurement of assets and liabilities of previously controlled and consolidated subsidiaries is not
permitted. As a result, we accounted for the Wireless Transaction by adjusting the carrying amount  of the noncontrolling interest to reflect the change in Verizon’ s
ownership interest in the Partnership. Any difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is
adjusted has been recognized in equity attributable to V erizon.
Omnitel T ransaction
On February 21, 2014, Verizon and Vodafone also consummated the sale of the Omnitel Intere st (the Omnitel Transaction) by a subsidiary of Verizon to a
subsidiary of Vodafone in connection with the Wireless Transaction pursuant to a separate share purchase agreement. As a result, during 2014, we recognized a
pre-tax gain of $1.9 billion on the disposal of the Omnitel interest in Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated businesses on our consolidated statement of
income.
Verizon Notes (Non-Cash T ransaction)
The Verizon Notes were issued pursuant to Verizo n’s existing indenture. The Verizon Notes were issued in two separate series, with $2.5 billion due February 21,
2022 (the eight-year Verizon Notes) and $2.5 billion due February 21, 2025 (the eleven-year Verizon Notes). The Verizon Notes bear interest at a floating rate,
which will be reset quarterly , with interest payabl e quarterly in arrears, beginning May 21, 2014. The eight-year Verizon notes bear interest at a floating rate equal
to three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus 1.222%, and the eleven-year Verizon notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month
LIBOR, plus 1.372%. The indenture that govern s the Verizon Notes contains certain negative covenants, including a negative pledge covenant and a merger or
similar transaction covenant, affirmative covena nts and events of default that are customary for companies maintaining an investment grade credit rating. An
event of default for either series of the Verizon Notes may result in acceleration of the entire principal amount of all debt securities of that series. Beginning two
years after the closing of the W ireless Transaction,
Verizon may redeem all or any portion of the outstanding Verizon Notes held by Vodafone or any of its affiliates for a redemption price of 100% of the principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Verizon Notes may only be transferred by Vodafone to third parties in specified amounts during specified periods,
commencing January 1, 2017. Any Verizon Notes  held by third parties will not be redeemable by Verizon prior to their maturity dates. Verizon has agreed to file a
registration statement with respect to the V erizon Notes at least three months prior to the V erizon Notes becoming transferable.
Other Consideration (Non-Cash T ransaction)
Included in the other consideration provided to Vodafone is the indirect assumption of long-term obligations with respect to 5.143% Class D and Class E
cumulative preferred stock (Preferred Stock) issued by one of the Purchased Entities. Both the Class D shares (825,000 shares outstanding) and Class E shares
(825,000 shares outstanding) are mandatorily redeemable in April 2020 at $1,000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Dividends accrue at
5.143% per annum and will be treated as interest expense. Both the Class D and Class E shares have been classified as liability instruments and were recorded at
fair value as determined at the closing of the W ireless T ransaction.
Deferr ed Tax Liabilities
Certain deferred taxes directly attributable to the Wireless Transaction have been calculated based on an analysis of taxes attributable to the difference between
the tax basis  of the investment in the noncontrolling interest that is assumed compared to Verizon’ s book basis. As a result, Verizon recorded a deferred tax
liability of approximately $13.5 billion.
Spectrum License T ransactions
Since 2013, we have entered into several strategic spectrum transactions including:
 
 • During the first quarter of 2013, we completed license exchange transactions with T-Mobile License LLC and Cricket License Company , LLC, a
subsidiary of Leap Wireless, to exchange certain  Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) licenses. These non-cash exchanges included a number of intra-
market swap s that we expect will enable Verizon  Wireless to make more efficient use of the AWS band. As a result of these exchanges, we received an
aggregate $0.5 billion of A WS licenses at fair value and recorded an immaterial gain.
 
 • During the third quarter of 2013, after receiving the required regulatory approvals, Verizon Wireless sold 39 lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses
to AT&T Inc. (AT&T) in exchange for a payment of $1.9 billion and the transfer by AT&T to Verizon Wireless of AWS (10 MHz) licenses in certain
markets in the western United States. Verizon Wireless also sold certain lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses to an investment firm for a payment
of $0.2 billion. As a result, we received $0.5 billion of AWS licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.3 billion in
Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
 
 • During the second quarter of 2014, we completed license exchange transactions with T -Mobile USA, Inc. (T -Mobile USA) to exchange certain A WS and
Personal Communication Services (PCS) licenses. The exchange included a number of swaps that we expect will result in more ef ficient use of the A WS
and PCS bands. As a result of these exchanges, we received $0.9 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum  licenses at fair value and we recorded an immaterial
gain.
 
 • During the second quarter of 2014, we completed transactions pursuant to two additional agreements with T-Mobile USA with respect to our remaining
700 MHz A block spectrum licenses. Under one agreement, we sold certain of these licenses to T-Mobile USA in exchange for cash consideration of
approximately $2.4 billion, and under the second  agreement we exchanged the remainder of our 700 MHz A block spectrum licenses as well as AWS
and PCS spectrum licenses for AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. As a result, we received $1.6 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value
and we recorded a pre-ta x gain of approximately $0.7 billion in Selling, general and administrative  expense on our consolidated statement of income for
the year ended December 31, 2014.
 
 • During the third quarter of 2014, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum
licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in January 2015 at which time we recorded an immaterial gain.
 
 • On January 29, 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum, which it identified as the AWS-3 band. Verizon participated in that auction
and was the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made a
deposit of $0.9 billion related to our participation  in this auction which is classified within Other , net investing activities on our consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an application to the FCC and paid $9.5 billion to
the FCC to complete payment for these licenses. The cash payment of $9.5 billion is classif ied within Acquisitions of wireless licenses on our
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015. On April 8, 2015, the FCC granted us these spectrum licenses.
 
 • During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed  a license exchange transaction with an affiliate of T-Mobile USA to exchange certain AWS and PCS
spectrum licenses. As a result we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately
$0.3 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.
 • During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum
licenses. This non-cash exchange is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2016 and we expect to record an immaterial gain.
 
 • During the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of Sprint Corporation, which provides for the exchange of
certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2016 and we expect to record an
immaterial gain.
Tower Monetization T ransaction
During Marc h 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive
rights to lease and operate approximately 1 1,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the leases, American T ower has
exclusive rights to lease and operate the towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase
options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for
$0.1 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew . The
upfront payment, including the towers sold, which is primarily included within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, is accounted for as deferred
rent and as a financing obligation. The $2.4 billion accounted for as deferred rent, which is presented within Other , net cash flows provided by operating
activities, relates to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use has passed to the tower operator . The $2.7 billion accounted for as a financing obligation,
which is presented withi n Other , net cash flows used in financing activities, relates to the portion  of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network
operations.
Other
During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we acquired variou s other wireless licenses and markets for cash consideration that was not significant. Additionally , during 2013,
we obtained control of previously unconsolidated  wireless partnerships, which were previously accounted for under the equity method and are now consolidated,
which resulted in an immaterial gain. In 2013, we recorded $0.2 billion of goodwill as a result of these transactions.
Wireline
Access Line Sale
On February  5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which
Verizon will sell its local  exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched
and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.5
billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from V erizon by Frontier . The transaction,
which includes the acqui sition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’ s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, does
not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently included in Verizon’ s continuing operations and
classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated  balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. For the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014, these businesses generated approximately $5.4 billion of revenues, excluding revenues with affiliates, for each respective year and
operating income of approximately $0.8 billion and an immaterial loss, respectively , based on the stand-alone financial results of the businesses. These amounts
include direc t expenses incurred of approximately $2.7 billion in each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and (credits) charges related to pension
and benefit actuarial valuation adjustments for these ILEC employees of $(0.2) billion and $0.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively . The amounts also include indirect overhead expenses, which are a significant comp onent of our cost structure. These stand-alone financial results
also include approximately $1.0 billion of depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively . In our consolidated
results, the depreciation and amortization of these  ILEC assets ceased at the beginning of 2015 in accordance with the accounting model for assets held for sale.
The transact ion is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions including, among others, receipt of federal approvals from the FCC and the antitrust
authorities and state regulatory approvals. All federal and state regulatory approvals have been obtained. We expect this transaction to close at the end of the first
quarter of 2016.
Based on the number of voice connections and Fios Internet and video subscribers, respectively , as of December 31, 2015, the transaction would result in Frontier
acquiring approximately  3.4 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses
from V erizon. The operating results of these businesses, collectively , are included within our W ireline segment for all periods presented.
The following table summarizes the major classes of assets and liabilities of our local exchange and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas
which are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015:
 
    (dollars in millions)  
Assets held for sale:   
Accounts receivable   $ 435

Other
On July 1, 2014, we sold a non-strategic Wireline business that provides communications solutions to a variety of government agencies for net cash proceeds of
$0.1 billion and recorded an immaterial gain.
During the fourth quarter  of 2015, Verizon completed a sale of real estate for which we received total gross proceeds of $0.2 billion and recognized an immaterial
deferred gain. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction have been classified within  Cash flows used in investing activities on our consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Other
Acquisition of AOL Inc.
On May 12, 2015, we entered into an Agreement  and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we commenced a tender
offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes.
On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by
Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware
law. If they had not exercised these rights, V erizon would have paid an additional $330 million for such shares at the closing.
AOL is a leader in the digital content and advertising platform space. Verizon has been investing in emer ging technology that taps into the market shift to digital
content and advertising. AOL ’s business model aligns with this approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a
digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams.
The acquisition of AOL has been accounted for as a business combination. The identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are finalized and we
are in the process of finalizing our valuations for deferred taxes. These adjustments are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. The valuations will be finalized within 12 months following the close of the acquisition.
The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the income, cost and market approaches. The fair value measurements were
primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined
in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, other than long-term debt assumed in the acquisition. The income approach was primarily used to value the
intangible assets, consisting primarily of acquired  technology and customer relationships. The income approach indicates value for an asset based on the present
value of cash flow projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving
the cash flow and the time value of money . The cost approach, which estimates value by deter mining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of
equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for plant, property and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or
replacement cost for the property , less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.
The followin g table summarizes the consideration to AOL ’s shareholders and the identification of the assets acquired, including cash acquired of $0.5 billion, and
liabilities assumed as of the close of the acquisition, as well as the fair value at the acquisition date of AOL ’s noncontrolling interests:
 
(dollars in millions)   As of June 23, 2015  
Cash payment to AOL ’s equity holders   $ 3,764   
Estimated liabilities to be paid    377  
     
Total consideration   $ 4,141   
     
Assets acquired:   
Goodwill   $ 1,903   
Intangible assets subject to amortization    2,504   
Other    1,551   
     
Total assets acquired    5,958   
Liabilities assumed:   
Total liabilities assumed    1,816   
Net assets acquired:    4,142   
Noncontrolling interest    (1) 
     
Total consideration   $ 4,141   
     
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideratio n transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The
goodwill recorded as a result of the AOL transaction represents future economic benefits we expect to achieve as a result of combining the operations of AOL and
Verizon as well as asset s acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The preliminary goodwill related to this acquisition is
included within Corporate and other (see Note 3 for additional details).
Pro Forma Information
If the acquis ition of AOL had been completed as of January 1, 2014, our results of operations,  including Operating revenues and Net income attributable to
Verizon, would not have been materially dif ferent from our previously reported results of operations.
Real Estate Transaction
On May 19, 2015, Verizon consummated a sale-l easeback transaction with a financial services firm for the buildings and real estate at our Basking Ridge, New
Jersey location. We received total gross proceed s of $0.7 billion resulting in a deferred gain of $0.4 billion, which will be amortized over the initial leaseback
term of twenty years. The leaseback of the buildings and real estate is accounted for as an operat ing lease. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction
have been classified within Cash flows used in investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Other
On September 3, 2015, AOL announced an agreement to acquire an advertising technology business for cash consideration that was not significant. The
transaction was completed in October 2015.
On October 7, 2014, Redbox Instant by Verizon, a venture between Verizon and Redbox Auto mated Retail, LLC (Redbox), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Outerwall Inc., ceased providing service to its customers. In accordance with an agreement between the parties, Redbox withdrew from the venture on
October 20, 2014 and Verizon wound down and dissolved the venture during the fourth quarter of 2014. As a result of the termination of the venture, we recorded
a pre-tax loss of $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.
During February 2014, Verizon acquired a business dedicated to the development of Internet Protocol (IP) television for cash consideration that was not
significant.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, Verizon acquired an industry leader in content delivery netwo rks for $0.4 billion. Upon closing, we recorded $0.3 billion of
goodwill. Additionally , we acquired a technolog y company for cash consideration that was not significant. The consolidated financial statements include the
results of the operations of each of these acquisitions from the date each acquisition closed.
On February 20, 2016, Verizon entered into a purchase agreement to acquire XO Holdings’ wireline business which owns and operates one of the largest fiber-
based IP and Ethernet networks outside of Verizon’ s footprint for approximately $1.8 billion, subject to adjustment. The transaction is subject to customary
regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2017. Separately , Verizon entered  into an agreement to lease certain wireless spectrum from XO
Holdings and has an option to buy XO Holdings’  entity that owns its wireless spectrum exercisable under certain circumstances.

classified as Assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively . See Note 2 for additional details.
At December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately $10.4 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively , of wireless licenses were under development for commercial service
for which we were capitalizing interest costs. The increase is primarily due to licenses acquired in the A WS-3 auction.
The average remaining renewal period of our wireless license portfolio was 5.6 years as of December 31, 2015. See Note 1 for additional details.

As a result of the acquisition of AOL in the second quarter of 2015, we recognized preliminary Goodwill of $1.9 billion, which is included within Other (see Note
2 for additio nal details). We also allocated $0.6 billion of goodwill on a relative fair value basis from Wireline to Other as a result of an internal reorganization.
This increase was partial ly offset by a decrease in Goodwill in Wireline primarily due to the reclassification of $1.3 billion of Goodwill to Non-current assets held
for sale on our consolida ted balance sheet at December 31, 2015 as a result of our agreement to sell our local exchange business and related landline activities in
California, Florida and T exas to Frontier (see Note 2 for additional details). The amount of Goodwill reclassified was based on a relative fair value basis.

leasing portfolio along with telecommunications equipment, commercial real estate property and other equipment. These leases have remaining terms of up to 23
years as of December 31, 2015. In addition, we lease space on certain of our cell towers to other wireless carriers. Minimum lease payments receivable represent
unpaid rentals, less principal and interest on third -party nonrecourse debt relating to leveraged lease transactions. Since we have no general liability for this debt,
which is secured by a senior security interest in the leased equipment and rentals, the related principal and interest have been offset against the minimum lease
payments. All recourse debt is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
At each reporting period , we monitor the credit quality of the various lessees in our portfolios. Regarding the leveraged lease portfolio, external credit reports are
used where available and where not available we use internally developed indicators. These indica tors or internal credit risk grades factor historic loss experience,
the value of the underlying collateral, delinquency trends, and industry and general economic conditions. The credit quality of our lessees varies from A to CCC+.
For each reporting perio d, the leveraged leases within the portfolio are reviewed for indicators of impairment where it is probable the rent due according to the
contractual terms of the lease will not be collected. All significant accounts, individually or in the aggregate, are current and none are classified as impaired.
Finance lease receivables, which are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, are comprised of the following:

Term Loan Agr eement
During the first quarter of 2015, we entered into a term loan agreement with a major financial institution, pursuant to which we borrowed $6.5 billion for general
corporate purposes, including the acquisition of spectrum licenses. Borrowings under the term loan agreement were to mature in March 2016, with a $4.0 billion
mandatory prepayment required in June 2015. The term loan agreement contained certain negative covenants, including a negative pledge covenant, a merger or
similar trans action covenant and an accounting changes covenant, affirmative covenants and even ts of default that are customary for companies maintaining an
investment grade credit rating. In addition, the term loan agreement required us to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the term loan agreement) not in excess
of 3.50:1.00, until our credit ratings were equal to or higher than A3 and A- at Moody’ s Investors Service and Standard & Poor ’s Ratings Services, respectively .
During March 2015, we prepaid approximately $5.0 billion of the term loan agreement, which satisfied the mandatory prepayment. During the third and fourth
quarters of 2015, respectively , we made repayments of approximately $1.0 billion and $0.5 billion. As of December 31, 2015, no amounts remained outstanding
under the term loan agreement.
Other
During June 2015, as part of the Merger Agreement with AOL, we assumed approximately $0.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations. As of December 31,

billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The net proceeds were used, in part, to finance the Wireless Transaction. Net proceeds not used to finance the
Wireless Transaction were used for general corporate purposes. Also, during February 2014, we issued $0.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.90% Notes
due 2054 resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $0.5 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

Notes due 2031. The issuance of these Notes resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $3.0 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs and after reimbursement
of certain expenses. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.
Verizon Notes (Non-Cash T ransaction)
During February 2014, in connection with the Wireless Transaction, we issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes. The Verizon Notes
were issued in two separate series, with $2.5 billion due February 21, 2022 and $2.5 billion due February 21, 2025. The Verizon Notes bear interest at a floating
rate, which will be reset quarterly , with interest payable quarterly in arrears, beginning May 21, 2014 (see Note 2). The eight-year Verizon notes bear interest at a
floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR, plus 1.222%, and the eleven-year Verizon notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR, plus
1.372%.
Preferr ed Stock (Non-Cash T ransaction)
As a result of the Wireless Transaction, we assumed long-term obligations with respect to 5.143% Class D and Class E cumulative Preferred Stock issued by one
of the Purch ased Entities . Both the Class D shares (825,000 shares outstanding) and Class E shares (825,000 shares outstanding) are mandatorily redeemable in
April 2020 at $1,000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Dividends accrue at 5.143% per annum and will be treated as interest expense. Both the
Class D and Class E shares have been classified as liability instruments and were recorded at fair value as determined at the closing of the W ireless T ransaction.
Term Loan Agr eement
During February 2014, we drew $6.6 billion pursuant to a term loan agreement, which was entered into during October 2013, with a group of major financial
institutions to finance, in part, the Wireless Transaction. $3.3 billion of the loans under the term loan agreement had a maturity of three years (the 3-Year Loans)
and $3.3 billion of the loans under the term loan agreement had a maturity of five years (the 5-Year Loans). The 5-Year Loans provide for the partial amortization
of principal during the last two years that they are outstanding. Loans under the term loan agreement bear interest at floating rates. The term loan agreement
contains certain negative covenants, including a negative pledge covenant, a merger or similar transaction covenant and an accounting changes covenant,
affirmative covenants and events of default that are customary for companies maintaining an investment grade credit rating. In addition, the term loan agreement
requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the term loan agreement) not in excess of 3.50:1.00, until our credit ratings are equal to or higher than A3
and A- at Moody’ s Investors Service and Standard & Poor ’s Ratings Services, respectively .
During June 2014, we issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed and floating rate notes resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $3.3 billion, net
of discounts and issuance costs. The issuances consisted of the following: $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2017 that will bear
interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.40% which will be reset quarterly and $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.35% Notes due 2017. We
used the net proceeds from the of fering of these notes to repay the 3-Y ear Loans on June 12, 2014.
During July 2014, we amended the term loan agreement, settled the outstanding $3.3 billion of 5-Year Loans and borrowed $3.3 billion of new loans. The new
loans mature in July 2019, bear interest at a lower interest rate and require lower amortization payments in 2017 and 2018. In connection with the transaction,
which primarily settled on a net basis, we recorded approximately $0.5 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings and of repayments of long-term
borrowings, respectively .

On July 23, 2014, we announced the commencement of eleven separate private offers to exchan ge (the July Exchange Offers) specified series of outstanding
Notes issued by Verizon and Alltel Corporation (collectively , the Old Notes) for new Notes to be issued by Verizon. The July Exchange Offers have been
accounted for as a modification of debt. On August 21, 2014, Verizon issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Notes due 2020 (the 2020 New
Notes), $4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.862% Notes due 2046 (the 2046 New Notes) and $5.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.012% Notes
due 2054 (the 2054 New Notes) in satisfaction of the exchange offer consideration on tendered Old Notes (not including accrued and unpaid interest on the Old
Notes). The following tables list the series of Old Notes included in the July Exchange Offers and the principal amount of each such series accepted by Verizon
for exchange.

Wireless Device Installment Plans
Under the Verizon devic e payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or tablets at unsubsidized prices on an installment basis (a device
installment plan). Customers that activate service  on devices purchased under the device payment program pay lower service fees as compared to those under our
fixed-term service plans, and their installment charge is included in their standard wireless monthly bill. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively , the
total portfolio of device installment plan receivables we are servicing was $11.9 billion and $3.8 billion. During 2015, we entered into programs to sell certain
device instal lment receivables. The outstanding portfolio of device installment plan receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets but which we
continue to service was $8.2 billion at December 31, 2015.
Wireless Device Installment Plan Receivables
The following table displays device installment plan receivables, net, that continue to be recognized in our consolidated balance sheets:

Device installment plan r eceivables, net   $3,134    $3,602   
     
At the time of sale, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device installment plan receivables. We record the imputed interest as a reduction to the related
accounts receivable. Interest income, which is included within Service revenues and other on our consolidated statements of income, is recognized over the
financed installment term.
We assess the collectabil ity of our device installment plan receivables based upon a variety of factors, including the credit quality of the customer base, payment
trends and other qualitative factors. We use custom, empirical, risk models to measure the credit  quality of a customer and determine eligibility for the device
payment program. Based upon the risk assessed by the models, a customer may be required to provide a down payment to enter into the program and may be
subject to lower limits on the total amount financed. The down payment will vary in accordance with the risk assessed. We update our risk assessments monthly
based on payment trends  and other qualitative factors in order to monitor the overall quality of our receivables. The credit quality of our customers is consistent
throughout the periods presented.
Activity in the allowance for credit losses for the device installment plan receivables was as follows:
 
(dollars in millions)      
Balance at January 1, 2015   $ 76

Balance at December  31, 2015   $      444   
     
Customers entering into device installment agreements prior to May 31, 2015 have the right to upgrade their device, subject to certain conditions, including
making a stated portion of the required device payments and trading in their device. Generally , customers entering into device installment agreements on or after
June 1, 2015 are required to repay all amounts due under their device installment agreement before being eligible to upgrade their device. However , certain
devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down the minimum percentage of their device installment plan
and trading in their devic e. When a customer is eligible to upgrade to a new device, we record a guarantee liability in accordance with our accounting policy . The
gross guarantee liability related to the upgrade program, which was approximately $0.2 billion at December 31, 2015 and $0.7 billion at December 31, 2014, was
primarily included in Other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
Sales of W ireless Device Installment Plan Receivables
Wireless Device Installment Plan Receivables Pur chase Agr eement
During the first quarter of 2015, we established a program (Receivables Purchase Agreement, or RPA) to sell from time to time, on an uncommitted basis, eligible
device instal lment plan receivables to a group of primarily relationship banks (Purchasers). Under the program, we transfer the eligible receivables to wholly-
owned subsidiaries that are bankruptcy remote special purpose entities (Sellers or SPEs). The Sellers then sell the receivables to the Purchasers for upfront cash
proceeds and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables (the deferred purchase  price). The receivables sold under the program are no longer
considered assets of Verizon. We continue to bill and collect on the receivables in exchange for a monthly servicing fee, which is not material. Eligible
receivables under the RP A exclude device installment plans where a customer was required to provide a down payment.
Revolving Sale of W ireless Device Installment Plan Receivables
During the fourth quarte r of 2015, we entered into a one-year uncommitted facility to sell eligible device installment plan receivables on a revolving basis
(Revolving Program), subject to a maximum funding limit, to the Purchasers. Sales of eligible receivables by the Sellers, once initiated, generally occur and are
settled on a monthly basis. The receivables sold under the Revolving Program are no longer considered assets of Verizon. We continue to bill and collect on the
receivables in exchange for a monthly servicing fee, which is not material. Customer installment payments will be available to purchase eligible installment plan
receivables originated over the facility’ s term. Eligible receivables under the Revolving Program exclude device installment plans where a customer was required
to provide a down payment.
The sales of receivables under the RPA and Revolving Program did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income. The cash proceeds
received from the Purchasers are recorded within Cash flows provided by operating activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
The followin g table provides a summary of devic e installment receivables sold under the RPA and the Revolving Program during the year ended December 31,
2015:

Deferred purchase price recorded    1,690      532     2,222   
 
 Device installment plan receivables net of allowances, imputed interest and the device trade-in right.
 As of December 31, 2015, cash proceeds received, net of remittances, were $5.9 billion.
Variable Inter est Entities
Under both the RPA and the Revolving Progra m, the SPE’ s sole business consists of the acquisition of the receivables from Verizon and the resale of the
receivables to the Purch asers. The assets of the SPEs are not available to be used to satisfy obligations of any Verizon entities other than the Sellers. We
determined that the SPEs are VIEs as they lack sufficient equity to finance their activities. Given that we have the power to direct the activities of the SPEs that
most signific antly impac t the SPE’ s economic performance, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the SPEs. As a result, we consolidate the assets and
liabilities of the SPEs into our consolidated financial statements.
Deferr ed Pur chase Price
Under both the RPA and the Revolving Program , the deferred purchase price was initially recor ded at fair value, based on the remaining installment amounts
expected to be collected, adjusted, as applicable, for the time value of money and by the timing and estimated value of the device trade-in. The estimated value of
the device trade-in consi ders prices expected to be offered to us by independent third parties. This estimate contemplates changes in value after the launch of a
device. The fair value measurements are considered to be Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy . The collection of the deferred purchase price is
contingent on collections from customers. At December 31, 2015, our deferred purchase price receivable was $2.2 billion, which is held by the SPEs and is
included within Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.
Continuing Involvement
Verizon has continuing involvement with the sold receivables as it services the receivables. We continue to service the customer and their related receivables,
including facilitating customer payment collection , in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. While servicing the receivables, the same policies and procedures are
applied to the sold receivables that apply to owned receivables, and we continue to maintain normal relationships with(1)
(2)
(1)
(2)
our customers. The credit quality of the customers we continue to service is consistent througho ut the periods presented. During the year ended December 31,
2015, we have collected and remitted approximat ely $1.3 billion, net of fees, of which an immater ial amount was returned as deferred purchase price. During the
year ended December 31, 2015, credit losses on receivables sold were an immaterial amount.
In addition, we have continuing involvement related to the sold receivables as we may be responsible for absorbing additional credit losses pursuant to the
agreements. The Company’ s maximum exposure  to loss related to the involvement with the SPEs  is limited to the amount of the deferred purchase price, which
was $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. The maximum exposure to loss represents an estimated loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical
circumstances whereby the Company would not receive the portion of the proceeds withheld by the Purchasers. As we believe the probability of these
circumstances occurring is remote, the maximum exposure to loss is not an indication of the Company’ s expected loss.

Equity securities consist of investments in common stock of domestic and international corporations measured using quoted prices in active markets.
Fixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds as well as U.S. Treasury securities. We use quoted prices in active markets for our
U.S. Treasury securities, therefore these securities are classified as Level 1. For all other fixed income securities that do not have quoted prices in active markets,
we use alternative matrix pricing resulting in these debt securities being classified as Level 2.
Derivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are
classified within Level 2. We use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our deriva tive instruments. Our derivative instruments are recorded on a
gross basis.
We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers within the fair value hierarchy

Derivative Instruments
Inter est Rate Swaps
We enter into domestic interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates based
on LIBOR, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against changes in the fair value
of our debt portfolio. W e record the interest rate swaps at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities.
During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $3.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into
interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $2.6 billion. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $7.6 billion
and $1.8 billion, respecti vely. The fair value of these contracts was $0.1 billion at December 31, 2015 and was not material at December 31, 2014. The ineffective
portion of these interest rate swaps was not material at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
Forwar d Inter est Rate Swaps
In order to manage our exposure to future intere st rate changes, we have entered into forward interest rate swaps. We designated these contracts as cash flow
hedges. At December 31, 2014, these swaps had a notional value of $2.0 billion. The fair value of these contracts was $0.2 billion at December 31, 2014, which
was included  within Other liabilities on our conso lidated balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2015, we settled these forward interest rate swaps and the pre-
tax loss was not material . During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into forward interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.8 billion. The fair value of
these contracts was not material at December 31, 2015.
Cross Curr ency Swaps
Verizon Wireless previously entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $1.6 billion of British Pound Sterling
and Euro-denominated debt into U.S. dollars and to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign
currency transaction gains or losses. In June 2014, we settled $0.8 billion of these cross currency swaps and the gains with respect to these swaps were not
material. In December 2015, we settled $0.6 billion of these cross currency swaps on maturity .
During the first quarter of 2014, we entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $5.4 billion of Euro and British
Pound Sterling denominated debt into U.S. dollars. During the second quarter of 2014, we entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to
exchange approximately  $1.2 billion of British Pound Sterling denominated debt into U.S. dollars. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into cross
currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $3.0 billion of Euro denominated debt into U.S. dollars and to fix our future interest
and principal payments in U.S. dollars. Each of these cross currency swaps was entered into in order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains
or losses.
A portion of the gains and losses recognized in Other comprehensive income was reclassified to Other income and (expense), net to offset the related pre-tax
foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying debt obligations. The fair value of the outstanding swaps was $1.6 billion and $0.6 billion, which was
primarily included within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively . At December 31, 2015, the total
notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $9.7 billion. During 2015 and 2014, a pre-tax loss of $1.2 billion and a pre-tax loss of $0.1 billion, respectively ,
was recognized in Other comprehensive income with respect to these swaps.
Net Investment Hedges
We entered into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar
net investme nts in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into net investment hedges
with a total notional value of $0.9 billion with the contract tenor maturing in 2018. The fair value of these contracts was not material at December 31, 2015.
Concentrations of Cr edit Risk
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary  cash investments, short-term and long-term investments, trade
receivables, certain notes receivable, including lease receivables, and derivative contracts. Our policy is to deposit our temporary cash investments with major
financial institutions. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are also major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA
master agreement) and credit support annex agreements which provide rules for collateral excha nge. We generally apply collateralized arrangements with our
counterparties for uncleared derivatives to mitigate credit risk. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we posted collateral of approximately $0.1 billion and $0.6
billion, respectively , related to derivative contr acts under collateral exchange arrangements, which were recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our
consolidated balance sheets. During the first and second quarters of 2015, we paid an immaterial amount of cash to enter into amendments to certain collateral
exchange arrangements. These amendments suspend cash collateral posting for a specified period of time by both counterparties. We may enter into swaps on an
uncollateralized basis in certain circumstances. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk
remote and do not expect the settlement of these transactions to have a material ef fect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Nonr ecurring Fair V alue Measur ements
The Company measures certain assets and liabil ities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. During the fourth quarter of 2014, certain long-lived assets met the
criteria to be classified as held for sale. At that time, the fair value of these long-lived assets was measured, resulting in expected disposal losses of $0.1 billion.
The fair value of these assets held for sale was measured with the assistance of third-party appraisals and other estimates of fair value, which used market
approach techniques as part of the analysis. The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3, as significant unobservable inputs were used in the valuation.
The expected disposal losses, which represented the difference between the fair value less cost to sell and the carrying amount of the assets held for sale, were
included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
Note 10
Stock-Based Compensation
Verizon Communications Long-T erm Incentive Plan
The Verizon Communications Inc. Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the Plan) permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. The maximum number of shares available for awards from the Plan is 119.6 million
shares.
Restricted Stock Units
The Plan provides for grants of Restricted Stock  Units (RSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. The RSUs are classified as equity
awards because the RSUs will be paid in Verizon  common stock upon vesting. The RSU equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon
common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. Dividend equivalent units are also paid to participants at the time the RSU award is
paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.
Performance Stock Units
The Plan also provides for grants of Performance  Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the Plan, the
Human Reso urces Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding
performance goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs are classified as liability awards because the PSU awards are paid in
cash upon vesting. The PSU award liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of
Verizon common stock as well as performance relative to the targets. Dividend equivalent units are also paid to participants at the time that the PSU award is
determined and paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the
performance goals achieved.

As of December 31, 2015, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’ s RSUs and PSUs was approximately $0.3 billion and
is expected to be recognized over approximately two years.
The RSUs granted in 2015 and 2014 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $48.15 and $47.23 per unit, respectively . During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we
paid $0.4 billion, $0.6 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively , to settle RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards.
Verizon W ireless’ Long-T erm Incentive Plan
The Verizon Wireless Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the Wireless Plan) provided compensation opportunities to eligible employees of Verizon Wireless (the
Partnership). Under the Wireless Plan, Value Appreciation Rights (VARs) were granted to eligible employees. We have not granted new VARs since 2004. As of
December 31, 2015, there are no V ARs that remain outstanding.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
After -tax compensation expense for stock-based compensation related to RSUs, PSUs and VARs described above included in Net income attributable to Verizon
was $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively .
Stock Options
The Plan provides for grants of stock options to participants at an option price per share of no less than 100% of the fair market value of Verizon common stock
on the date of grant. Each grant has a 10-year life, vesting equally over a three-year period, starting at the date of the grant. We have not granted new stock
options since 2004. As of December 31, 2015, there are no stock options that remain outstanding.
 
Note 1 1
Employee Benefits
We maintain  non-contributory defined benefit pension plans for many of our employees. In addition, we maintain postretirement health care and life insurance
plans for our retirees and their dependents, which are both contributory and non-contributory , and include a limit on our share of the cost for certain recent and
future retirees. In accord ance with our accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits, operating expenses include pension and benefit related
credits and/or charges based on actuarial assump tions, including projected discount rates and an estimated return on plan assets. These estimates are updated in
the fourth quarter to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. The adjustment is recognized in the income statement during the fourth
quarter or upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
Pension and Other Postr etirement Benefits
Pension and other postretirement benefits for many of our employees are subject to collective  bargaining agreements. Modifications in benefits have been
bargained from time to time, and we may also periodically amend the benefits in the management plans. The following tables summarize benefit costs, as well as
the benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status and rate assumptions associated with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

Assumptions
The weighted-average assumptions used in determining benefit obligations follow:

The weighted-average assumptions used in determining net periodic cost follow:
 
   Pension   Health Car e and Life  
At December 31,   2015   2014   2013   2015   2014   2013  
Discount Rate    4.20%   5.00%   4.20%   4.20%   5.00%   4.20% 
Expected return on plan assets    7.25    7.25    7.50    4.80    5.50    5.60  
Rate of compensation increases    3.00    3.00    3.00    N/A    N/A    N/A  
Effective January 1, 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the interest component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement
benefits. Historically , we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average  discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the
benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of interest cost by applying the specific
spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevan t projected cash flows. We have made this change to provide a
more precise measurement of interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. We will
account for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly will account for it prospectively . We estimate the impact of this change on our
consolidated GAAP results for the first quarter of 2016 will be a reduction of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost and an increase to Net
income by approximately $0.1 billion. However , at this time the estimated impact of this change on the remaining 2016 interim periods and for annual 2016
results cann ot be reasonably estimated because  it is possible that in the future there may be changes to underlying assumptions, including an interim
remeasurement of our benefit obligations, which could result in different estimates. The use of the full yield curve approach does not impact how we measure our
total benefit obligations at year end or our annual  net periodic benefit cost as any change in the interest cost component is completely offset by the actuarial gain
or loss meas ured at year end which is immediately recognized in the income statement. Accordi ngly, this change in estimate will not impact our income from
continuing operations, net income or earnings per share as measured on an annual basis.
In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each major asset class over the
subsequent 10-year period. Those estimates are based on a combination of factors including the current market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus
earnings expectations and historical long-term risk premiums. To determine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset
class is then weighted according to the allocation to that investment area in the trust’ s long-term asset allocation policy .
The assumed health care cost trend rates follow:
 
   Health Car e and Life  
At December 31,   2015   2014   2013  
Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year    6.00%   6.50%   6.50% 
Rate to which cost trend rate gradually declines    4.50    4.75    4.75  
Year the rate reaches the level it is assumed to remain thereafter    2024     2022     2020   
A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following ef fects:
 
   (dollars in millions)  
One-Percentage Point   Increase    Decr ease  
Effect on 2015 service and interest cost   $ 249    $ (194) 
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015    3,074      (2,516 ) 
Plan Assets
The company’ s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets which allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk
and return. While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed so that 65% of the assets have the
objective of achieving a return in excess of the growth in liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds and emer ging debt) and
35% of the assets are invested as liability hedgin g assets (where cash flows from investments better match projected benefit payments, typically longer duration
fixed income). This alloc ation will shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to
ensure they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market efficiencies and various
other factors . Due to our diversification and risk control processes, there are no significant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector , industry , geography or
company names.
Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of V erizon common stock.

The following are gener al descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies and inputs used to determine the fair value of each major
category of assets.
Cash and cash equivalen ts include short-term investment funds, primarily in diversified portfolios of investment grade money market instruments and are valued
using quoted market prices or other valuation methods, and thus are classified within Level 1 or Level 2.
Equity secur ities are investments in common stock of domestic and international corporations in a variety of industry sectors, and are valued primarily using
quoted mark et prices at the end of the reporting  period or other valuation methods based on observable inputs, and thus are classified as Level 1 or Level 2.
Investments not traded on a national securities  exchange use other valuation methods such as pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics depending upon market activity and availability of quoted market prices, and thus are classified as Level 3.
Fixed incom e securities include U.S. Treasuries and agencies, debt obligations of foreign governm ents and domestic and foreign corporations. Fixed income also
includes investments in collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities and interest rate swaps. The fair value of fixed income securities is based
on observab le prices for identical or comparabl e assets, adjusted using benchmark curves, sector grouping, matrix pricing, broker/dealer quotes and issuer
spreads, and thus are classified within Level 1 or Level 2.
Real estate investments include those in limite d partnerships that invest in various commercial and residential real estate projects both domestically and
internationally . The fair values of real estate assets are typically determined by using income and/or cost approaches or a comparable sales approach, taking into
consideration discount and capitalization rates, financial conditions, local market conditions and the status of the capital markets, and thus are classified within
Level 3.
Commingled funds, included within the Cash and cash equivalents, Equity securities, Fixed income securities and Real estate investment asset categories, are
typically valued at net asset value (NAV) provide d by the fund administrator . NAV is the redemption value of the units held at year end. As a practical expedient,
management has determined that NA V approximates fair value. These assets are categorized as Level 2 or Level 3 depending upon liquidity .
Private equity investments include those in limite d partnerships that invest in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange. Investment
strategies in private equity include leveraged buyouts, venture capital, distressed investments and investments in natural resources. These investments are valued
using inputs such as trading multiples of compa rable public securities, merger and acquisition activity and pricing data from the most recent equity financing
taking into consideration illiquidity , and thus are classified within Level 3.
Hedge fund investments include those seeking to maximize absolute returns using a broad range of strategies to enhance returns and provide additional
diversification. The fair values of hedge funds are estimated using the NA V of the investments as a practical expedient. Investments of this type for which V erizon
has the ability to fully redeem at NAV within the near term are classified within Level 2. Invest ments that cannot be redeemed in the near term are classified
within Level 3.
Employer Contributions
In 2015, we contributed $0.7 billion to our qualified pension plans, $0.1 billion to our nonqualified pension plans and $0.9 billion to our other postretirement
benefit plans. W e anticipate a minimum contribution of $0.6 billion to our qualified pension plans in 2016. Nonqualified pension plans contributions are estimated
to be $0.1 billion and contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be $0.9 billion in 2016.
Estimated Futur e Benefit Payments
The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows:
 
       (dollars in millions)  
Year   Pension Benefits    Health Car e and Life  
2016   $ 1,906     $ 1,390

2021-2025    6,699      6,889   
Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We maintain four leverag ed employee stock ownership plans (ESOP). We match a certain percenta ge of eligible employee contributions to the savings plans with
shares of our common stock from this ESOP . At December 31, 2015, the number of allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was 57 million. There were
no unallocated shares of common stock in this ESOP at December 31, 2015. All leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations.
Total savings plan costs were $0.9 billion in 2015, $0.9 billion in 2014 and $1.0 billion in 2013.

Severance, Pension and Benefit (Cr edits) Char ges
During 2015 , we recorded net pre-tax severance,  pension and benefit credits of approximately $2.3 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which  they occur . The credits were primarily driven by an increase in
our discount rate assump tion used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2014 to a weighted-average of 4.6%
at December 31, 2015 ($2.5 billion), the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015 ($1.0 billion) and a change in mortality assumptions primarily
driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2015) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.9 billion), partially offset by the difference between our estimated
return on assets of 7.25% at December 31, 2014 and our actual return on assets of 0.7% at Decem ber 31, 2015 ($1.2 billion), severance costs recorded under our
existing separation plans ($0.6 billion) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion).
During 2014 , we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit charges of approximately $7.5 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which  they occur . The charges were primarily driven by a decrease in
our discount rate assump tion used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2013 to a weighted-average of 4.2%
at December  31, 2014 ($5.2 billion), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (RP-2014 and MP-2014) issued by
the Society of Actuaries in October 2014 ($1.8 billion) and revisions to the retirement assumptio ns for participants and other assumption adjustments, partially
offset by the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.25% and our actual return on assets of 10.5% ($0.6 billion). As part of this charge, we
recorded severance costs of $0.5 billion under our existing separation plans.
During 2013 , we recorded net pre-tax severance,  pension and benefit credits of approximately $6.2 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which  they occur . The credits were primarily driven by an increase in
our discount rate assump tion used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2012 to a weighted-average of 5.0%
at December 31, 2013 ($4.3 billion), lower than assumed retiree medical costs and other assumption adjustments ($1.4 billion) and the difference between our
estimated return on assets of 7.5% at December 31, 2012 and our actual return on assets of 8.6% at December 31, 2013 ($0.5 billion).

The following table shows the principal reasons for the dif ference between the ef fective income tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate:

Effective income tax rate    34.9%   21.7%   19.6% 
     
The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was
primarily due to the impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension
and benefit charges recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in connection with the Omnitel Transaction in
2014.
The effective income tax rate for 2014 was 21.7% compared to 19.6% for 2013. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to additional
income taxes on the incremental income from the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014 and was partially offset by the utilization of certain tax
credits in connection with the Omnitel Transact ion in 2014 and the effective income tax rate impact of lower income before income taxes due to severance,
pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014 compared to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2013. The decrease in the provision for income
taxes was primarily due to lower income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014 compared to severance, pension and
benefit credits recorded in 2013.
The amounts of cash taxes paid are as follows:
 
   (dollars in millions)  
Years Ended December 31,   2015    2014    2013

Total   $    8,445     $    7,180     $    3,786   
     
Deferred taxes arise because of differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabiliti es. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities
are as follows:
 
   (dollars in millions)  
At December 31,   2015   2014

Net deferred tax liability   $    45,386    $    41,449   
     
At December 31, 2015, undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States amounted to approximately $1.8 billion.
The majority  of Verizon’ s cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent on foreign cash or earnings to meet our funding
requirements, nor do we intend to repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations. Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings
represent amounts that legally must be kept in reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdictional requirements and are unavailable for distribution or
repatriation. As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings  because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested
outside of the United States and therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to
these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
At December 31, 2015, we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $4.1 billion that primarily relate to state and
foreign tax losses. Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $2.5 billio n will expire between 2016 and 2035 and approximately $1.6
billion may be carried forward indefinitely .
During 2015, the valuation allowance increased approximately $1.6 billion primarily as a result of the acquisition of AOL. The balance of the valuation allowance
at December 31, 2015 and the 2015 activity is primarily related to state and foreign tax losses.
Unrecognized T ax Benefits
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
 
      (dollars in millions)  
    2015   2014   2013  
Balance at January 1,   $1,823    $2,130    $2,943   
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year    194    80    116  
Additions for tax positions of prior years    330    627    250  
Reductions for tax positions of prior years    (412)   (278)   (801) 
Settlements    (79)   (239)   (210) 
Lapses of statutes of limitations    (221)   (497)   (168) 
     
Balance at December 31,   $    1,635    $1,823    $2,130   
     
Included in the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is $1.2 billio n, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively , that if recognized,
would favorably af fect the ef fective income tax rate.
We recognized the following net after -tax benefits related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes:
 
Years Ended December 31,   (dollars in millions)  
2015   $  43  
2014    92  
2013    33  
The after -tax accruals for the payment of interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
 
At December 31,   (dollars in millions)  
2015   $  125  
2014    169  
The decrease in unrecogn ized tax benefits was primarily due to an internal restructure that elimina ted certain state unrecognized tax benefits and the expiration of
the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions, partially of fset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to the acquisition of AOL.
Verizon and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer , we are
under audit by the IRS and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years. The IRS is currently examining the Company’ s U.S. income tax
returns for tax years 2010-2012, Cellco Partnership’ s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2013-2014, and AOL ’s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2011-
2012. Tax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2006. The amount of the liability  for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve
months due to the expira tion of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonab ly possible that various current tax examinations will conclude
or require reevaluations of the Company’ s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made until these tax matters
are further developed or resolved.

Segment Information
Reportable Segments
We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services. We
measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker ’s assessment of segment
performance.
Corporate and other includes the operations of AOL and related businesses, unallocated corporate expenses, the results of other businesses, such as our
investments in unconsolidated businesses, pension and other employee benefit related costs and lease financing. Effective January 1, 2014, we have also
reclassified the results of certain businesses, such as development stage businesses that support our strategic initiatives, from our Wireline segment to Corporate
and other . The impact of this reclassification was not material to our consolidated financial statements or our segment results of operations. Corporate and other
also includes the historical results of divested operations and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due
to their non-operational nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings.
Gains and losses that are not individually signif icant are included in all segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker ’s
assessment of segment performance.
On July 1, 2014, our Wireline segment sold a non-strategic business (see Note 2). Accordingly , the historical Wireline results for these operations have been
reclassified to Corporate and other to reflect comparable segment operating results.
The reconcil iation of segment operating revenu es and expenses to consolidated operating revenues and expenses below also includes those items of a non-
operational nature. We exclude from segment results the effects of certain items that management does not consider in assessing segment performance, primarily
because of their non-operational nature.
We have adjusted prior period consolidated and segment information, where applicable, to conform to current year presentation.
Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following:
 
Segment   Description
Wireless
  Wireless’ communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer ,
business and government customers across the United States.
Wireline
  Wireline’ s voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data, corporate networking
solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these
products and services to consumers in the United  States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and
around the world.

The amounts presented above in net other comprehensive loss are net of taxes and noncontrolling interests, which are not significant. For the year ended
December 31, 2015, the amounts reclassified to net income related to defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in the table above are included in Cost of
services and Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income. For the year ended December 31, 2015, all other amounts
reclassified to net income in the table above are included in Other income and (expense), net on our consolidated statement of income.
Foreign Curr ency T ranslation Adjustments
The change in Foreign currency translation adjustments during 2015 was related to our non-U.S. dollar net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The change in
Foreign currency translation adjustments during 2014 was primarily a result of the completion of the Omnitel transaction. The change in Foreign currency
translation adjustments during 2013 was primarily related to our investment in Vodafone Omnitel N.V. which was driven by the movements of the U.S. dollar
against the Euro.
Net Unr ealized Gains (Losses) on Cash Flow Hedges
During 2014  and 2013, Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in Other compr ehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests
primarily reflect activity related to cross currency swaps. Reclassification adjustments on cash flow hedges primarily reflect the reclassification to Other income
and (expense ), net of a portion of the unrealized gains and losses on cross currency swaps to offset related pre-tax foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the
underlying debt obligations (see Note 9).
Net Unr ealized Gains (Losses) on Marketable Securities
During 2015, 2014 and 2013, reclassification adjustments on marketable securities for gains (losses) realized in net income were not significant.
Defined Benefit Pension and Postr etirement Plans
The change in Defined benefit pension and postretirement plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively , was not significant.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, Verizon repurchased approximately 2.8 million share s of the Company’ s common stock under our authorized share
buyback program for approximately $0.1 billion. At December 31, 2015, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon
under our share buyback program was 97.2 million.
In addition to the previou sly authorized three-year share buyback program, in February 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an
accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion of the Company’ s common stock. On February 10, 2015, in exchange for an up-front
payment totaling $5.0 billion, Verizon received an initial delivery of 86.2 million shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion. On June 5, 2015, Verizon
received an additional 15.4 million shares as final settlement of the transaction under the ASR agreement. In total, 101.6 million shares were delivered under the
ASR at an average repurchase price of $49.21.
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareowner plans, including 22.6 million common
shares issued from T reasury stock during the year ended December 31, 2015, which had an aggregate value of $0.9 billion.
Note 16
Commitments and Contingencies
In the ordina ry course of business Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal level. Where it is
determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter , the Company establishes
an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate  of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the
amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including (1) uncertain damage theories and
demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable
nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do
not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods, including the Hicksville matter described below , will have a
material ef fect on our financial condition, but it could have a material ef fect on our results of operations for a given reporting period.
Reserves have been established to cover environm ental matters relating to discontinued businesses  and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include
funds to address contam ination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In
September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken
primary responsibility for addressing the contami nation at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to
the past and future expen ses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites
requiring remediation.
Verizon is currently involved in approximately 60 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. Most of these cases are brought
by non-pract icing entitie s and effectively seek only monetary damages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold products and seek injunctive
relief as well. These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved.
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the
purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial  matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From
time to time, counterpar ties may make claims under these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary
course of business.
Subsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was issued when the
directory business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensions). The preexisting guarantee continues, without modification, despite the
subsequent sale of Verizon Information Services  Canada and the spin-of f of our domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories business. The possible
financial impact of the guarantee, which is not expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably estimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the
guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may of fset each other . We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely .
As of December 31, 2015, letters of credit totaling approximately $0.1 billion, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several
financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.
We have several commit ments primarily to purch ase programming and network services, equipme nt, software, handsets and peripherals, and marketing activities,
which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business, from a variety of suppliers totaling $21.9 billion. Of this total amount, $8.4 billion is attributable to
2016, $9.2 billion is attributable to 2017 through  2018, $2.3 billion is attributable to 2019 through 2020 and $2.0 billion is attributable to years thereafter . These
amounts do not represent our entire anticipated  purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our
commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities or termination amounts. Purchases against our commitments for 2015 totaled
approximately $10.2 billion. Since the commitm ents to purchase programming services from television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum
volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at December 31, 2015, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect
at that time. W e also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment.
