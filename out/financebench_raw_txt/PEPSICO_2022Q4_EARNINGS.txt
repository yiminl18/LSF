instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume  change due to the 
impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, 
temporary timing differences between  bottler case sales ( BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents ( CSE). We 
report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE.  The volume sold by our nonconsolidated 
joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.

Discussion  of Fourth-Quarter 2022  Reported Division Results:
In addition to the reported net revenue performance  as set out in the tables on pages 2 and A-9, reported 
operating results were driven by the following:
Frito-Lay North America
Operating profit increased 9%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and productivity savings. These 
impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, a 19-
percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, seasoning and potatoes, and 
higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment charges associated with a baked 
fruit convenient food brand reduced operating profit growth by 5 percentage points. The 53rd reporting 
week contributed  7 percentage points to operating profit growth.
Quaker Foods North America
Operating profit decreased 3%, primarily reflecting a 48-percentage-point impact of higher commodity 
costs, mainly grains and packaging materials, certain operating cost increases, including incremental 
transportation costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset 
by effective net pricing and productivity savings. The 53rd reporting week positively contributed 7 
percentage points to operating profit performance . Higher restructuring and impairment charges 
negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points. 
PepsiCo Beverages North America
Operating profit increased 13%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing, higher income from join t ventures 
and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, 
including incremental informational technology costs, a 53-percentage-point impact of higher commodity 
costs, primarily fuel and resin, an organic volume decline and higher advertising and marketing 
expenses. The 53rd reporting w eek contributed 9 percentage points to operating profit growth . The lower 
net revenue due to the sale of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands and higher restructuring 
and impairment charges reduced operating profit growth by 32 percentage points  and  9 pe rcentage 
points, respectively.
Latin America
Operating profit increased 5%, primarily reflecting net revenue growth, productivity savings, a 7-
percentage-point favorable impact of adjusting certain non-income tax accruals in Mexico and a 3-
percentage-point favorable impact of lower charges taken as a result of the novel coronavirus 
(COVID-19) pandemic. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 45-
percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, grains and packaging materials, 
higher  advertising and marketing expenses and a 4-percentage-point unfavorable impact of certain 
indirect tax credits in Brazil in the prior year. Additionally, a favorable adjustment to the final purchase 
price  associated wit h our sa le of certain non-strategic brands contributed 3 percentage points to 
operating profit growth.
Europe
Operating profit decreased 420%, primarily reflecting a 400-percentage-poin t unfavorable impact of 
impairment charges related to the SodaStream brand (other impairment charges). Operating profit 
performance was also negatively impacted by a 141-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, 
primarily packaging materials, cooking oil and potatoes, and certain operating cost increases. These 
impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing and productivity savings. Higher restr ucturing and 
impairment c harges negatively impacted operating profit performance by 10 percentage points.
Africa, Middle East and South Asia
Operating profit decreased 148%, primarily reflecting a 105-percentage-point impact of impairment and 
other charges associated with our decision to sell or discontinue certain non-strategic brands and an 
investment  (brand portfolio impairment charges) and a 21-percentage-point impact of impairment charges 
3
primarily related  to certain juice brands from the Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods) acquisition 
(other impairment charges). Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by a 167-
percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily grains, cooking oil and packaging materials, 
certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by net 
revenue growth and productivity savings. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating 
profit performance by 15 percentage points.
Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region
Operating profit decreased 215%, primarily reflecting a 237-percentage-point impact of impairment 
charges related to the Be & Cheery brand  (other impairment charges) and a 6-percentage-point impact of 
impairment charges on certain property, plant and equipment due to the discontinuation of a n on-strategic 
brand (brand portfolio impairment charges) in China . Operating profit performance was also negatively 
impacted by a 96-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily potatoes and cooking oil, 
certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by net 
revenue growth and productivity savings . Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating 
profit performance by 11 percentage points.

Discussion of Full-Year 2022  Reported Division Results:
In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 5 and A-9, reported 
operating results were driven by the following:
Frito-Lay North America
Operating profit increased 9%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. 
These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, a 
17-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, potatoes and seasoning, 
and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment charges associated with a 
baked fruit convenient food brand reduced operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points (other 
impairment charges). The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.
Quaker Foods North America
Operating profit grew 4.5%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These 
impacts were partially offset by a 37-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily grains 
and packaging materials, certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, the 
decrease in organic volume and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The 53rd reporting week 
contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.
PepsiCo Beverages North America
Operating profit increased 122%, primarily reflecting a 124-percentage-point impact of the gain of $3.0 
billion associated with the  sale of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands partially offset by a 2-
percentage-point impact of related transaction costs.  Operating profit growth was also driven by the net 
revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including 
incremental transportation and information technology costs, and a 42-percentage-point impact of higher 
commodity costs, primarily aluminum and resin. A current-year gain associated with the sale of an asset 
and the 53rd reporting week contributed 6 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, to 
operating profit growth. Additionally, operating profit growth was reduced by a 15-percentage-point impact 
of the lower net revenue due to the sale of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands.
Latin America
Operating profit increased 19%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 3-
percentage-point favorable impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These 
impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 41-percentage-point impact of higher 
commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, packaging materials and grains, and higher advertising and 
marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment and other charges associated with the sale of certain non-
strategic brands reduced operating profit growth by 4.5 percentage points (brand portfolio impairment 
charges).
Europe
Operating profit decreased 207%, primarily reflecting a 110-percentage-point unfavorable impact of 
charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a 98-percentage-point unfavorable impact of 
impairment charges related to the SodaStream brand (other impairment charges) and a 20-percentage-
point unfavorable impact primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets due to the 
discontinuation or repositioning of certain juice and dairy brands in Russia (brand portfolio impairment 
charges), partially offset by a 23-percentage-point favorable impact of the gain associated with the Juice 
Transaction. Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by a 91-percentage-point impact 
of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging materials, raw milk and potatoes, certain operating cost 
increases, the organic volume decline, a 4-percentage-point impact of less favorable settlements of 
promotional spending accruals compared to the prior year and a 4-percentage-point impact of payments 
to employees for a change in pension benefits. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net 
pricing, productivity savings and lower advertising and marketing expenses. Unfavorable foreign 
exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 7 percentage points.
6
Africa, Middle East and South Asia
Operating profit decreased 22%, primarily reflecting a 19-percentage-point impact of impairment and 
other charges associated with our decision to sell or discontinue certain non-strategic brands and an 
investment (brand portfolio impairment charges) and a 4-percentage-point impact of impairment charges 
primarily related to certain juice brands from the Pioneer Foods acquisition (other impairment charges). 
Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by a 74-percentage-point impact of higher 
commodity costs, primarily packaging materials, grains and cooking oil, certain operating cost increases 
and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by the net revenue growth and 
productivity savings. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 
9 percentage points. 
Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region
Operating profit decreased 20%, primarily reflecting a 25-percentage-point impact of impairment charges 
related to the Be & Cheery brand (other impairment charges). Operating profit performance was also 
negatively impacted by a 25-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and 
potatoes, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset 
by the net revenue growth and productivity savings. Additionally, prior-year impairment charges 
associated with an equity method investment positively contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit 
performance. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 4 
percentage points.

Guidance  and Outlook
The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are 
included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and commodity 
mark-to-market net impacts.
For 2023 , the Company expects: 
•A 6 percent increase in organic revenue;
•An 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS;
•A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; and
•Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.7 billion, comprised of dividends of $6.7 
billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion.
In addition, the Company expects a n approximate 2-percentage-point foreign exchange translation 
headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus 
rates.
This assumption and the guidance above imply 2023 core EPS of $7.20, a 6 percent increase compared 
to 2022 core EPS of $6.79.
Dividend Increase
The Company today announced a 10 percent increase in its annualized dividend to $5.06 per share from 
$4.60 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2023. This represents the 
Company’s 51st consecutive annual dividend per share increase.

Non-GAAP Measures
In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency 
results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of 
our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for 
certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures  provides additional information to facilitate 
comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional 
transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures  allows investors to view our 
performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. 
We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or 
that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which 
we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to 
restructuring plans; charges associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated 
with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement 
and curtailment gains and losses); charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax 
law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt 
redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, 
certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items 
affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other 
net periodic pension costs continue to be reflected in our core results.  See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP 
financial measures included herein. 
Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a 
substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial 
measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.
Glossary
We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures :
Bottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both 
PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.
Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.
Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates 
in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as 
appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, 
as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.
Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. For further 
information regarding these excluded items refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2022  Form 10-K. For the periods presented, core results 
exclude the following items:
Mark-to-market net impact
Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are 
subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating 
profit.
Restructuring and impairment charges
Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through 
the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.
Acquisition and divestiture-related charges
Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include  fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the 
acquisition-date balance sheets (recorded in cost of sales), merger and integration charges and costs associated with 
divestitures (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses) . Merger and integration charges include liabilities to 
support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, gains associated with contingent consideration, employee-related costs, 
contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, 
including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.
A - 6
Gain associated with the Juice Transaction
We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions. 
Impairment and Other Charges
We recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as 
described below.
Russia-Ukraine conflict charges  
In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.  
Brand portfolio impairment charges
We recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result 
of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment . 
Other Impairment Charges
We recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflect an increase in 
the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future financial performance.
Pension and retiree medical-related impact
Pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding 
the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.
Charge related to cash tender offers  
As a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorded a charge primarily representing the tender 
price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk 
on the cash tender offers.  
Tax Benefit Related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Audit
We recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 
2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.
Tax expense related to the TCJ Act
Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.
Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting 
from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries .
Organic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures and 
other structural changes, and every five or six years, the impact of the 53rd reporting week, including in our 2022 financial 
results. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects  mergers and acquisitions activity,  including the impact in 2021 of an 
extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods  in our Africa, Middle East and South Asia division and 
Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. ( Be & Cheery ) in our Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region division 
as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions, as well as divestitures and other 
structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.  
We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes 
items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.
2023  guidance
Our 2023  organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural chang es, the 
impact of the 53rd reporting week in 2022 an d foreign exchange translation. Our 2023  core effective tax rate guidance and our 
2023  core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated 
expenses, restructuring and impairment charges and other items noted above. Our 2023  core constant currency EPS growth 
guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2023  
organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2023  reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023  
impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to 
predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile 
our full year projected 2023  core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2023  reported effective tax rate and our full year 
projected 2023  core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2023  reported EPS growth because we are unable 
A - 7
to predict the 2023  impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the 
unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a 
reconciliation of these measures.

nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between  BCS and CSE. We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage 
businesses based on CSE.  The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.
