Reportable
Segments
 
We
 have two reportable segments based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments within the regions in which they operate: wholly owneddomestic
 resorts and MGM China. We currently operate 12 wholly owned resorts in the United States. MGM China’s operations consist of the MGM Macau resortand
 casino (“MGM Macau”) and the development of an integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau. We have additional businessactivities
 including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”)is our
 most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee.  See “Resort Operations” below, as well as “Executive Overview” in Management’sDiscussion
 and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  and  Note  16  in  the  accompanying  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  foradditional informat
ion related to our segments. 
Resort
Operations
 
General
 
Our
 casino resorts offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities.  We believe we own or invest in several of thefinest
 casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resortsthrough
 newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. Most of our revenue is cash-based,
 through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards.  We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generateoperating cash flow to fund cap
ital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. 
We believe we operate the
 highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. As discussed above, ensuring our resorts are the premier resortsin
 their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests. The quality of our resorts and amenities can bemeasured
 by  our  success  in  winning  numerous  awards,  both  domestic  and  globally,  including  several  Four  and  Five  Diamond  designations  from  the  AmericanAutomobile Association as well as 
multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide. 
Our
 results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing ofmajor conventions, the amoun
t and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming 
1

 customers, and the level o 
f play during major holidays, including New Year and Chi nese New Year.  While our results do not depend on key individual customers, asignificant
 portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in o ur  results.  In addition, our success inmarketing
 to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customersfrom a specific country or
 region can affect our result s.  
All
 of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Grand Victoria which operates 22 hours a day, every day of theyear.
  At our wholly owned domestic resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us.  Other resort amenities may be owned andoperated
 by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties.  We utilize third-party management for specific expertise in operationsof
 restaurants and nightclubs.  We lease space to retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us isnot desirable or feasib
le.

Wholly

owned
domestic
resorts.
Over  half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations, includinghotel,
 food  and  beverage,  entertainment  and  other  non-gaming  amenities.  We  market  to  different  customers  and  utilize  our  significant  convention  and  meetingfacilities
 to  allow  us  to  maximize  hotel  occupancy  and  customer  volumes  during  off-peak  times  such  as  mid-week  or  during  traditionally  slower  leisure  travelperiods,
 which also leads to better labor utilization.  Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects theprice we can charge for ou
r hotel rooms and other amenities. 
Our
 casino operations feature a variety of slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering.  In addition, we offer our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge expe
riences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere. 
MGM

China.
We  own a 51% controlling interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (“MGM China”), which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGMGrand
 Paradise”), the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau resort and casino and the related gaming subconcession and land concession. Webelieve
 our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Macau isthe world’s largest gaming d
estination in terms of revenue and we expect future growth in the Asian gaming market. 
Our
 current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and the development of an integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip inMacau, discussed further below. Reven
ues at MGM Macau are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession heldby
 MGM Grand Paradise. The Macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGMGrand
 Paradise  gaming  subconcession  was  granted  by  Sociedade  de  Jogos  de  Macau,  S.A.,  and  expires  in  2020.   The  Macau  government  currently  prohibitsadditional
 concessions  and  subconcessions,  but  does  not  place  a  limit  on  the  number  of  casinos  or  gaming  areas  operated  by  the  concessionaires  andsubconcessionaires, though addit
ional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations. 
In October 2012, MGM Grand Paradi
se formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of Macau to develop aresort
 and casino on an approximately 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip in Macau (“MGM Cotai”).  The land concession contract became effective when the Macaugovernment published the agreement in
 the Official Gazette of Macau on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years.  Under the terms of the land concessioncontract, MGM Grand Paradise is r
equired to build and open MGM Cotai by January 2018. 
Construction
 of MGM Cotai commenced in 2013 and it is anticipated to open at the end of the first quarter of 2017. China State Construction EngineeringCorporation serves
 as the sole general contractor for the project.  MGM Cotai will be an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort with capacity for up to 500gaming
 tables  and  up  to  1,500  slots,  and  featuring  approximately  1,500  hotel  rooms.   The  actual  number  of  gaming  tables  allocated  to  MGM  Cotai  will  bedetermined
 by the Macau government prior to opening, and such allocation may be less than our 500 gaming table capacity.  The total estimated project budget is$3.0 billion, excluding developm
ent fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs. 
Customers
and
Competition
 
Our casino
 resorts operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the marketswe
 operate in, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii.  Our gaming operations compete to alesser
 extent  with  state-sponsored  lotteries,  off-track  wagering,  card  parlors,  online  gambling  and  other  forms  of  legalized  gaming  in  the  United  States  andinternationally.
 
Our primary methods of success
ful competition include: 
 
·Locating our resorts in desi rable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets; 
·Constructing  and  maintaining  high-quality  resorts  and  facilities,  including  luxurious  guestrooms,  state-of-the-art  convention  facilities  and  premierdining, entertainment, retail a
nd other amenities; 
·Recruiting, training and r etaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service; 
·Providing unique, “must-see” en tertainment attractions; and 
·Developing distinctive and m emorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.

Our customers  include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and groupcustomers,
 including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings.  We have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each marketsegment
 and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilizeto drive business to our resorts du
ring mid-week and off-peak periods.

Our
 Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on ornear the
 Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewherein
 the Las Vegas area.   Our Las Vegas Strip resorts also compete, in part, with each other.  According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, therewere
 approximately  149,200  and  150,500  guestrooms  in  Las  Vegas  at  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  respectively.   At  December  31,  2015,  we  operatedapproximately
 27%  of  the  guestrooms  in  Las  Vegas.   Las  Vegas  visitor  volume  was  42.3  million  in  2015,  a  2.9%  increase  from  the  41.1  million  reported  for2014.
  Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or are currently expanding their capacity or constructingnew resorts in Las Vegas.  Also, the growth of ga
ming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas. 
Outside
 Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, wherelocation is
 a critical factor to success.  In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. Forexample,
 in Detroit, Michigan we compete with a casino in nearby Windsor, Canada and with Native American casinos in Michigan.  In Biloxi, Mississippi wecompete with regional r
iverboat and land-based casinos in Louisiana, Native American casinos in central Mississippi and with casinos in Florida and the Bahamas. 
MGM
China.


The three  primary customer segments in the Macau gaming market are VIP casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slotmachine
 operations. VIP gaming play is sourced both internally and externally.  Externally sourced VIP gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoterswho
 offer VIP players various services, such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel, food and beverage services.  Gaming promoters operate VIPgaming
 rooms within the property.  In exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements or rollingchip
 turnover based commissions.  In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate.  These clientele areacquired
 through  our  direct  marketing  efforts.  Unlike  gaming  promoters  and  in-house  VIP  players,  main  floor  players  do  not  receive  commissions.   The  profitcontribution
 from the main floor segment exceeds the VIP segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. Gaming revenues from the main gamingfloors
 have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future.  To target premiummain
 floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield, we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals,which include both
 table games and slots, to the main floor gaming area. The amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floorplayers.  
 
Our
 key  competitors  in  Macau  include  five  other  gaming  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires.  If  the  Macau  government  were  to  grant  additionalconcessions
 or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations orcash
 flows.  Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from several concessionaires who have expansion plans announced or underway,primarily on the Cotai Str
ip with several expected openings in 2016 and 2017. 
We
 expect competition in the Macau market to continue to increase, as more capacity is brought online in the near future.  We also encounter competitionfrom
 major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world, including Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Las Vegas,cruise ships in Asia that off
er gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region. 
Corporate

and
other.


Much  like  our  wholly  owned  resorts,  our  unconsolidated  affiliates  compete  through  the  quality  of  amenities,  the  value  of  theexperience offered
 to guests and the location of their resorts.  Aria, which we manage and own 50% through CityCenter, appeals to the upper end of each segment inthe
 Las Vegas market and competes with our wholly owned casino resorts and other resorts on the Las Vegas Strip.  Our other unconsolidated affiliates mainlycompete for customers again
st casino resorts in their respective markets. 
Marketing
 
Our
 marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs as discussed further below. We advertise on radio, television,internet and billboards and in newspapers an
d magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through theuse
 of social media.  We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities.  A key element of marketing to premiumgaming
 customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel.  Direct marketing is also important in the convention segment.  We maintain websites to informcustomers
 about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms, make restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets.  We actively utilize severalsocial media sites to p
romote our brands, unique events, and special deals.

 golf privileges at Shadow Creek in North Las Vegas.  In connection with our marketing activities, we also invite our premium gaming customers to playShadow

  MGM  Macau’s  loyalty  program  is  the  Golden  Lion  Club,  a  tiered  program  which  meets  the  needs  of  a  range  of  members  from  lowerspending
 leisure and entertainment customers through the highest level VIP cash players.  The structured rewards system based on member value and tiers ensuresthat
 customers  can progressively  access the full  range of services  that the resort  provides. The program  is aspirational  by design and transparent  in its rewards,encouraging members to in
crease both visitation and spend.  In addition to the rewards offered to Golden Lion Club members, MGM Macau has developed dedicatedgaming
 and non-gaming areas to reflect different levels of rated play. Information from the Golden Lion Club is used to analyze customer usage by segment andindividual player profile.

In
 addition to the Golden Lion Club program, MGM Macau has also created and continues to expand several luxurious private gaming salons that providedistinctive,
 high-end environments for the VIP players brought to the resort through gaming promoters and the in-house VIP marketing team.  MGM Macau hascreated a variety of incentive 
programs to reward gaming promoters for increased business and efficiency. 
Technology
 
We
 utilize various types of technology to maximize revenue, drive efficiency in our operations, and serve our customers more effectively. We continue tomove
 forward on standardizing the technology platforms for several of our key operational systems. The standardization of these systems will afford us efficienciesin
 operations and integration with future technology. These systems capture charges made by our customers during their stay, including allowing customers of ourresorts
 to charge meals and services at our other local resorts to their hotel folio. Additionally, we utilize yield management programs at our resorts that help usmaximize occupancy and 
room rates.   
We
 continue  to  enhance  our  eCommerce  platform,  which  is  critical  to  our  digital  platforms  that  support  our  domestic  portfolio  of  casino  resorts.  OureCommerce

Diversity
and
inclusion.
Diversity  and inclusion are fundamental to our Company’s value system, our people philosophy, our cultural life and therefore, ourcompetitive
 advantage as an employer and destination of choice for our global customer base.  Our diversity initiative at our resorts fosters employee engagement,individual responsibility, 
team collaboration, leadership competency, high performance and innovation.  Our diversity initiative has been widely recognized for manyyears and has been awarded nume
rous accolades. 
Philanthropy

and
community
engagement.
  Our  host  community  and  social  investments  are  prioritized  to  strengthen  the  communities  where  ouremployees
 live, work and care for their families.  Our community platform features three main programs: our Corporate Giving Program, our employee-fundedMGM
 Resorts Foundation and our Employee Volunteer Program.  Through these channels, we make financial and in-kind donations, contribute volunteer serviceand participate
 in civic and non-profit organizations and issues that advance the quality of life in our communities. Key investment areas include basic human needs,diversity, public educat
ion, health and wellness and environmental sustainability. 
Environmental

sustainability.
We  continue  to  gain  recognition  for  our  comprehensive  environmental  responsibility  initiatives  in  energy  and  waterconservation,
 recycling  and  waste  management,  sustainable  supply  chain  and  green  building.   Certain  of  our  casino  resorts  in  Nevada  and  our  casino  resort  inMichigan
 were the first in each state to earn certification from Green Key, the largest international program evaluating sustainable hotel operations.  We receivedcertifications
 at all of our wholly owned domestic resorts and Aria and Vdara at CityCenter. Aria, Vdara, Bellagio and Mandalay Bay are the only casino resorts toreceive
 “Five Green Key” (the highest possible) ratings.  Many major travel service providers recognize the Green Key designation and identify our resorts for theircontinued commitment 
to sustainable hotel operations.  
In
 addition, we believe that incorporating the tenets of sustainability in our business decisions advances a platform for innovation and operational efficiency.CityCenter
 (Aria, Vdara, Veer, Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas, and The Shops at Crystals) is one of the world’s largest private sustainable developments. With sixLEED 
® Gold certifications from the U.S. Green Building Council, CityCenter serves as the standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility withinthe large-scale hospi
tality industry.  
At
 MGM Macau, we incorporate the same commitment to environmental preservation.  Our efforts to improve energy efficiency, indoor air quality, andenvironmental stewardship h
ave resulted in MGM Macau receiving the Macau Environmental Protection Bureau – Macau Green Hotel Award. 
The
 construction of MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield will further position MGM Resorts as a leader in sustainable resort operations, and byadopting innovative technolog
ies in the design and operating practices of these resorts, we are advancing our commitment to protecting the planet in new regions. 
Development
and
Leveraging
Our
Brand
and
Management
Assets
 
In
 allocating  resources,  our  financial  strategy  is  focused  on  managing  a  proper  mix  of  investing  in  existing  resorts,  spending  on  new  resorts  and  otherdevelopments or
 initiatives and repaying long-term debt. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts thatwill provide profitable 
returns. 
We
 regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets. Opportunities we evaluate may include theownership,
 management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada, or in states other than Nevada, or outside of the United States. Weleverage
 our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of ourbrands,
 particularly the “MGM Grand,” “Bellagio,” and “Skylofts” brands, are well suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming developments. We mayundertake these opportunit
ies either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.

In 2013,
 the Company formed Las Vegas Arena Company, LLC (the “Las Vegas Arena Company”) with a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc.(“AEG”)
 – a leader in sports, entertainment, and promotions – to design, construct, and operate an arena, located on a parcel of the Company’s land between FrankSinatra
 Drive and New York-New York, adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip. The Company and AEG each own 50% of Las Vegas Arena Company. Such developmentis
 estimated to cost approximately $350 million, excluding  capitalized interest and land related costs and is scheduled to open in April 2016.  The  Las Vegas ArenaCompany
 recently entered into a multi-year naming rights agreement with T-Mobile.  T-Mobile Arena will have a limited number of exclusive founding partnerswhich

 has entered into management agreements for future non-gaming hotels, resorts and residential products in the Middle East, North Africa, Indiaand
 the United States. In 2014, the Company and the Hakkasan Group formed MGM Hakkasan Hospitality (“MGM Hakkasan”), owned 50% by each member, todesign,
 develop and manage luxury non-gaming hotels, resorts and residences under certain brands licensed from the Company and the Hakkasan Group. Uponformation,
 the Company contributed its management agreements for non-gaming hotels, resorts and residential projects (outside of the greater China region) underdevelopment
 to MGM Hakkasan. In May 2015, the Company and the Hakkasan Group mutually agreed to terminate MGM Hakkasan and the brand license fromHakkasan
 Group. The Company will continue to develop these projects under its brands through MGM Hospitality (a wholly owned subsidiary). Additionally, theCompany will continue to develop and

Formation
and
 Proposed
Initial
Public
Offering
of
MG M
Growth
Properties,
LLC
(“
MGP”
) 
On
 October 29, 2015, we announced the formation of MGP, a newly formed subsidiary that we expect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)for U.S. federal
 income tax purposes. We intend to contribute the real estate associated with Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, New York-New York, Luxor, Monte Carlo,Excalibur,
 The  Park,  MGM  Grand  Detroit,  Beau  Rivage  and  Gold  Strike  Tunica  (collectively,  the  “Properties”)  to  a  newly  formed  operating  partnership  (the“Operating
 Partnership”), which MGP will control through a general partner subsidiary. We also intend to incur approximately $4 billion of debt to refinance aportion
 of the debt outstanding under our existing senior credit facility and senior notes, which refinancing debt would be assumed by the Operating Partnership inconnection with the REIT transaction. 
One of our subsidiaries will then lease the Properties from MGP for use under a long-term, “triple net” master lease agreementwith an initial
 10-year term that includes four five-year extensions at our option. We will guarantee our subsidiary’s obligations under the master lease. We expect toretain
 through subsidiaries an approximate 70% economic interest in the new Operating Partnership, as well as voting control of MGP through our ownership of acontrolling share in MGP.
 
We
 also announced that MGP had submitted a draft confidential registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) relating to itsproposed
 initial  public  offering  (“IPO”)  of  shares,  the  proceeds  of  which  would  be  used  to  purchase  an  approximate  30%  economic  interest  in  the  OperatingPartnership.
 The  transaction  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  the  first  half  of  2016,  subject  to  regulatory  approvals,  including  receipt  of  approvals  from  gamingregulators,
 MGP’s registration statement on Form S-11 being declared effective by the SEC, completion of the related financings needed to fund MGP, generalmarket conditions and othe
r customary conditions. MGP is expected to file the REIT election with its tax return for the calendar year ending December 
7

 31,
 2016.  We  may,  at  any  time  and  for  any  reason  until  the  proposed  transaction  is  complete,  abandon  the  transaction  or  modify  or change  the  terms  of  thetransaction.
 
Although the number of shares that will be sold
 to the public in connection with the proposed IPO has not been determined, we expect that we will continue toconsolidate
 MGP’s  results  of  operations  with  our  business  for  accounting  purposes  upon  the  completion  of  the  proposed  IPO  and  for  so  long  as  we  retain  thecontrolling
 share in MGP. The minority interest that we do not own following the completion of the proposed IPO will be reflected in our consolidated balancesheets
 as  “non-controlling  interests”  and  such  interest’s  proportionate  share  of  MGP’s  net  income  or  losses  will  be  reflected  in  our  consolidated  statements  ofoperations
 as “net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests.” We have no current intention to dispose of our controlling share of MGP or our economicinterests in the opera
ting partnership. 
Intellectual
Property
 
Our
 principal  intellectual  property  consists  of  trademarks  for,  among  others,  Bellagio,  The  Mirage,  Mandalay  Bay,  MGM,  MGM  Grand,  MGM  ResortsInternational,
 Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Circus Circus and Beau Rivage, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the UnitedStates.  In addition, we have
 also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects inthe United States and in various o
ther foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider thesebrand
 names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation andimage
 that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used andperiodically
 renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, andenforcement of our tr
ademark rights.
Employees
and
Labor
Relations
 
As
 of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 44,600 full-time and 14,900 part-time employees domestically, of which 6,100 and 2,300, respectively,support
 the  Company’s  management  agreements  with  CityCenter.   In  addition,  we  had  approximately  5,900  employees  at  MGM  Macau.   We  had  collectivebargaining
 contracts  with  unions  covering  approximately  29,900  of  our  employees  as  of  December  31,  2015.   In  November  2013,  Las  Vegas  union  employeesapproved
 new collective bargaining agreements covering most of our Las Vegas union employees; these agreements expire in 2018.  Pursuant to the terms of theCompany’s labor agreements for its 10
 Las Vegas properties, the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas (Culinary and Bartenders Unions) and the Company willre-open
 its  collective  bargaining  agreements.  The  purpose  of  these  discussions  includes  wage  negotiation,  the  funding  of  benefit  funds  for  the  remainder  of  thecontract
 term, and alternative business and financial models for operating food and beverage venues.  In December 2015, Detroit union employees, represented bythe
 Detroit  Casino  Council,  approved  a  new  five-year  collective  bargaining  agreement.   Gold  Strike  Tunica  is  currently  engaged  in  bargaining  for  a  first  laborcontract
 with a council of unions representing various hotel and food and beverage constituencies.  As of December 31, 2015, none of the employees of MGMMacau are part of a l
abor union and the resort is not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
Regulation
and
Licensing
 
The
 gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.  Each of our casinos is subjectto
 extensive  regulation  under  the  laws,  rules  and  regulations  of  the  jurisdiction  in  which  it  is  located.   These  laws,  rules  and  regulations  generally  concern  theresponsibility,
 financial  stability  and  character  of  the  owners,  managers,  and  persons  with  financial  interest  in  the  gaming  operations.  Violations  of  laws  in  onejurisdiction could resul
t in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.   
A
 more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, whichExhibit is incorporated he
rein by reference. 
Our
 businesses  are  subject  to  various  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations  affecting  businesses  in  general.   These  laws  and  regulationsinclude,
 but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and buildingcodes
 (including regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations  to meet certain federal requirements related toaccess
 and use by disabled persons) ,  construction, land use and marketing and advertising.  We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and aresubject
 to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or newlaws
 and regulations could be enacted.  Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authoritiescould adversely affec
t our operating results.

 In
 addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environm ental  laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean WaterAct,
 the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.Under
 various fede ral,  state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation ofcertain hazardous or
 toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator  knows of, or is responsible for, thepresence
 of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effecton us or the results of our opera
tio ns.

RISK
FACTORS
 
  
You should
 be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the SECcould have
 a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, amongother things, the risks descr
ibed below.
Risks
Relating
to
Our
Substantial
Indebtedness

 
·Our  substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability tosatisfy
 our  obligations.   As  of  December  31,  2015,  we  had  approximately  $12.8  billion  principal  amount  of  indebtedness  outstanding,  including$2.7
 billion of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility and $1.2 billion of available borrowing capacity.  Any increase in theinterest
 rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund ourother
 liquidity  needs.   In  addition,  as  of  December  31,  2015,  MGM  China  had  approximately  $1.6  billion  of  debt  outstanding  under  its  creditfacility.
  Furthermore, in January 2016, our subsidiary MGM National Harbor, LLC entered into a $525 million senior secured credit facility consistingof
 a $425  million  delayed  draw term  loan,  of which $250 million  was  funded at closing,  and a  $100 million  revolver.  We do  not guarantee  MGMChina’s
 or  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC’s  obligations  under  their  respective  credit  agreements  and,  to  the  extent  MGM  Macau  or  MGM  NationalHarbor,
 LLC were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into such entities islimited by the covenants 
in our existing senior secured credit facility.   
In addition, our substantial 
indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including: 
 
· increasing our exposure to gen eral adverse economic and industry conditions; 
· limiting our flexibi lity to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; 
· limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; 
· making it more diffi cult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or 
· placing us at a competitive  disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors. 
Moreover,
 our businesses are capital intensive.  For our owned and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically investsignificant
 capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished.  Such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and, to theextent
 that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained.  Similarly, developmentprojects,
 including the T-Mobile Arena project and our development projects in Massachusetts and Maryland, and acquisitions could require significantcapital
 commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt, or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of whichcould have an adverse eff
ect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

economic
and
credit
market
conditions
could
adversely
affect
our
ability
to
service
or
refinance
our
indebtedness
and
to
makeplanned
expenditures
.   Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures andinvestments
 depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries, includingMGM
 China, borrow under our senior secured credit facility or incur new indebtedness.  If regional and national economic conditions deteriorate wecould experience decreased revenues
 from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cashto fund our
 liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments.  We cannot assure you that our businesswill
 generate sufficient cash flow from operations, continue to receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries, including MGMChina, that
 future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtednessor to
 fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional indebtedness on terms that arefavorable to us.
 
We
 have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2016, and thereafter.  Our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in thefuture
 will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis,we
 might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments.  There is noassurance
 that any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or onterms that would not requir
e us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.

·The
agreements
governing
our
senior

contain
restrictions
and
limitations 
that
could
significantlyaffect

our
ability
to
operate
our
business,
as
well
as
significantly
affect
our
liquidity,
and
therefore
could
adversely
affect
our
results
of
operations.  Covenants governing our senior secur
ed credit facility and cert ain of our debt securiti es restrict, among other things, our ability to:   
 
· pay dividends or distributions, r epurchase or issue equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments; 
· incur additional debt;  
· incur liens on assets;  
· sell assets or consolidat e with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets; 
· enter into transact ions with affiliates; 
· allow certain subsidiaries  to transfer assets; and 
· enter into sale and le ase-back transactions. 
Our
 ability  to  comply  with  these  provisions  may  be  affected  by  events  beyond  our  control.   The  breach  of  any  such  covenants  or  obligations  nototherwise
 waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which inturn
 could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness.  Any default under our senior secured credit facility orthe
 indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to makepayments on our debt.
 
In
 addition, MGM Grand Paradise and MGM China are co-borrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and MGM National Harbor, LLC isthe
 borrower  under a  senior  secured  credit  facility,  each  of  which contains  covenants  that  restrict  their  ability  to  engage  in  certain  transactions.   Inparticular,
 the MGM China credit facility and the MGM National Harbor, LLC senior secured credit facility require MGM China and MGM NationalHarbor,
 LLC,  as  applicable,  to  satisfy  various  financial  covenants,  including  a  maximum  consolidated  total  leverage  ratio  and  minimum  interestcoverage ratio.
 These agreements also impose certain operating and financial restrictions on MGM China and MGM National Harbor, LLC, and each oftheir
 subsidiaries (including, with respect to MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise), including, among other things, limitations on their ability to paydividends
 or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in other businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, ortransfer or sell assets.
 
Risks
Related
to
our
Business

 
·There
are
risks
associated
with
our
proposed
REIT
transaction.
 On  October 29, 2015, we announced the formation of MGP and our intention that itelect
 to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. Federal income tax purposes following the proposed contribution of certain of our properties and related debt andequity
 financing transactions, including the IPO of MGP shares as reflected in a draft confidential registration statement filed with the SEC. Followingthe
 completion of the IPO and the filing of its election to be taxed as a REIT, MGP would be a publicly traded, controlled REIT primarily engaged inowning,
 acquiring and leasing large-scale  casino resort properties, which include casino gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment,  retail andmixed-use facilities, and ot
her resort amenities. 
The
 completion of the proposed REIT transaction and IPO is subject to numerous conditions and the finalization of terms relating to the transactions,which
 are subject to a number of variables, including changes in market conditions, and may not occur on favorable terms or at all. We have not yetdetermined
 the number of shares that will be sold in the proposed IPO or the valuation of such shares. Therefore, the amount of cash we expect to raisein connection with the proposed IPO and r
elated transactions, and the degree to which we are able to reduce our indebtedness, is uncertain. 
In connection with the proposed REIT t
ransaction and IPO: 
 
· our  stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to developments relating to the proposed REIT transaction and IPO or otheraction or market specu
lation regarding the proposed REIT transaction and IPO;  
· we  will incur substantial increases in general and administrative expense associated with the need to retain and compensate third-party consultants and advisors 
(including legal counsel); 
· although  we have  no plan or intention  of  disposing of our interest  in  MGP and the operating  partnership  following  the proposedtransactions,
 to  the  extent  that  future  dispositions  result  in  our  owning  less  than  a  controlling  interest  in  MGP,  MGP’s  financialresults
 may no longer be consolidated with our financial results, which may materially and adversely affect our consolidated resultsof operations; and
 
· we may  not complete the proposed REIT transaction and IPO, in which event we will have incurred significant expenses that we willbe unable to recover, and fo
r which we will not receive any benefit. If the 
13

  
proposed  IPO is completed, MGP would be a new publicly traded company. We cannot make any assurances that the proposed IPO,if
 completed, will increase our market value. In addition, the IPO and related transactions are subject to customa ry  approvals andother risks, many of which are ou
tside our control, including changes in legislation and tax rules.   
 
·We
face
significant
competition
with
respect
to
destination
travel
locations
generally
and
with
respect
to
our
peers
in
the
industries
in
which
wecompete,
and
failure
to

compete
effectively
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
business,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations
and
cash
flow
.  The hotel,
 resort and casino industries are highly competitive.  We do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel,resort
 and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers.  To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel roomcapacity
 is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase.  Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may alsoexpand
 their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas and Macau, allof
 which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas, including California, has increased the competition facedby our operations in Las Vegas and els
ewhere. 
In
 addition,  competition  could  increase  if  changes  in  gaming  restrictions  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  result  in  the  addition  of  new  gamingestablishments located
 closer to our customers than our casinos, such as has happened in California.  For example, while our Macau operations competeto
 some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near Asia (including Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, andunlicensed
 gaming operations), certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippinesand
 Russia) and others (such as Japan, Taiwan and Thailand) may legalize casino gaming (or online gaming) in the future.  Furthermore, currentlyMGM
 Grand  Paradise  holds  one of  only six  gaming  concessions  authorized  by  the Macau  government  to  operate  casinos  in Macau.   If  the Macaugovernment
 were to  allow additional  competitors  to operate  in Macau  through the grant  of additional  concessions  or if  current  concessionaires  andsubconcessionaires
 open additional facilities (for example, the facilities currently being developed in Cotai, Macau are expected to increase total hotelroom inventory by 30% and signifi
cantly increase other gaming and non-gaming offerings in Macau), we would face increased competition.   
Most
 jurisdictions  where  casino  gaming  is  currently  permitted  place  numerical  and/or  geographical  limitations  on  the  issuance  of  new  gaminglicenses.
  Although a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in somecases
 new  gaming  operations  may  be  restricted  to  specific  locations  and  we  expect  that  there  will  be  intense  competition  for  any  attractive  newopportunities
 (which  may  include  acquisitions  of  existing  properties)  that  do  arise.   Furthermore,  certain  jurisdictions,  including  Nevada  and  NewJersey,
 have also legalized forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions have legalized video gaming terminals.  The expansion of online gaming andother
 types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casinoresorts.
 
In
 addition  to  competition  with  other  hotels,  resorts  and  casinos,  we  compete  with  destination  travel  locations  outside  of  the  markets  in  which  weoperate.
  Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, results of opera
tions and cash flow. 
 
·Our
businesses
are
subject
to
extensive
regulation
and
the
cost
of
compliance
or
failure
to
comply
with
such
regulations
may
adversely
affect
ourbusiness

and
results
of
operations
.   Our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states andprovinces
 in which we operate.  These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility,financial
 stability  and  character  of  the  owners  and  managers  of  gaming  operations  as  well  as  persons  financially  interested  or  involved  in  gamingoperations.
  As  such,  our  gaming  regulators  can  require  us  to  disassociate  ourselves  from  suppliers  or  business  partners  found  unsuitable  by  theregulators
 or, alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction.  In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreignunconsolidated
 affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions.  Theregulatory
 environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our resultsof
 operations.  In addition, we are subject to various gaming taxes, which are subject to possible increase at any time by various federal, state, local andforeign
 legislatures and officials.  Increases in gaming taxation could also adversely affect our results.  For a summary of gaming and other regulationsthat affect our business, s
ee “Regulation and Licensing” and Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Further,
 our  directors,  officers,  key  employees  and  investors  in  our  properties  must  meet  approval  standards  of  certain  state  and  foreign  regulatoryauthorities.  If stat
e regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we 
14

 would
 be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in the property.  Stateregulatory
 agencies  may  conduct  investigations  into  the  conduct  or associations  of  our  directors,  officers,  key  employees  or  investors  to  ensurecompliance
 with  applicable  standards.   Certain  public  and  private  issuances  of  securities  and  other  transactions  also  require  the  approval  of  certainregulatory authorities.
 
In
 Macau, current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are, for the most part, fairly recent and there is little precedent onthe
 interpretation of these laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in thefuture
 render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, whichcould
 have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, MGM China’s activities in Macau aresubject
 to  administrative  review  and  approval  by  various  government  agencies.   We  cannot  assure  you  that  MGM  China  will  be  able  to  obtain  allnecessary
 approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations.  Macau laws permit redress tothe courts with respect to 
administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues. 
In
 addition  to  gaming  regulations,  we  are  also  subject  to  various  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations  affecting  businesses  ingeneral.
  These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters,smoking,
 employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising.  For instance, we are subject to certainfederal,
 state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource ConservationRecovery
 Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  Under various federal,state
 and local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation ofcertain
 hazardous  or  toxic  substances  or  wastes  located  on  its  property,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  present  owner  or  operator  knows  of,  or  isresponsible
 for, the presence of such substances or wastes.  Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, ornew
 laws and regulations could be enacted.  For example, Illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places, including bars, restaurants,work
 places, schools and casinos. Similarly, in October 2014, casinos in Macau, including MGM China, implemented a smoking ban which prohibitssmoking
 on all mass market gaming floors and, in 2015, the Macau Health Bureau announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposinga
 full smoking ban in casinos, including in VIP rooms. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in thefuture cannot be predic
ted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance. 
We
 also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-money
 laundering laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970,commonly
 known as the "Bank Secrecy Act", which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") any currencytransactions
 in  excess  of  $10,000  that  occur  within  a  24-hour  gaming  day,  including  identification  of  the  individual(s)  involved  in  the  currencytransaction.
 We  are  also  required  to  report  certain  suspicious  activity  where  we  know,  suspect  or  have  reason  to  suspect  transactions,  among  otherthings,
 involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawfulpurpose. In
 addition, under the Bank Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention.Our
 compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could beinterpreted diffe
rently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the BankSecrecy Act, or regulations by 
any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
·Our
business
is
affected
by
economic
and
market
conditions
in
the
markets
in
which
we
operate
and
in
the
locations
in
which
our
customers
reside.
  Our  business  is  particularly  sensitive  to  reductions  in  discretionary  consumer  spending  and  corporate  spending  on  conventions,  trade  shows  andbusiness
 development.  Economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditionsmay
 cause a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer.  In addition,changes
 in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstable jobmarket,
 perceived  or  actual  disposable  consumer  income  and  wealth,  outbreaks  of  contagious  diseases  or  fears  of  war  and  future  acts  ofterrorism.
  Consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including as a result of demographic changes, which, for instance,has
 resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences ofconsumers
 and react to these trends and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations.  Aria, Bellagio and MGM Grand LasVegas
 in particular may be affected by economic conditions in the Far East, and all of our Nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in theUnited States, and California 
in particular.  A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant 
15

  
economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generall y is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts, which would adversely affectour
 op erating  results.  For example, the prior recession and downturn in consumer and corporate spending had a negative impact on our results ofoperations. 
  
In
 addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau from mainland China, general economic and market conditionsin
 China could impact our financial prospects.  Any slowdown in economic growth or changes to China’s current restrictions on travel and currencymovements,
 including market impacts resulting from China’s recent anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by non-banklending
 entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals), could disrupt the number of visitorsfrom
 mainland  China  to  MGM  Macau  and/or  the  amounts  they  are  willing  to  spend  in  the  casino.   For  example,  from  2008  through  2010,  Chinareadjusted
 its visa policy toward Macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland Chinese citizens may make to Macau in a given timeperiod.
  In addition, effective October 2013, China banned “zero‑ fare” tour groups involving no or low up-front payments and compulsory shopping,which
 were popular among visitors to Macau from mainland China and in December 2014 the Chinese government tightened the enforcement of visatransit
 rules for those seeking to enter Macau at the Gongbei border (including requirements to present an airplane ticket to a destination country, a visaissued
 by such destination country and a valid Chinese passport). It is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect, becomemore
 restrictive, or be readopted in the future.  These developments have had, and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have,the effect of reduc
ing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland China, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.Furthermore,
 our operations in Macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources.  Our success in Macau will be impacted by ourability
 to retain and hire employees.  We compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that suchcompetition
 will grow in light of new developments in Macau.  While we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort, certainMacau government
 policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we only hireMacau
 residents as dealers in our casinos).  In addition, limitations on the number of gaming tables permitted by the Macau government could impactour
 current  expectation  on  the  number  of  table  games  we  will  be  able  to  utilize  at  our  Cotai  project.   Such  limitations  or  reduction  in  table  gameavailability
 may impact MGM China’s results of operations. Finally, because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developedin
 the future, existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to Macau.  If transportation facilitiesto
 and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as agaming destination, as well 
as the results of operations at our development in Cotai, Macau, could be negatively impacted. 
 
·We
may

of
the
anticipated
benefits
of
our
Profit
Growth
Plan.
We  have  undertaken  an  initiative  for  sustained  growth  and  marginenhancement,
 focused on improving our business processes to optimize scale for greater efficiency and lower costs throughout our business. While we believe
 these initiatives will result in approximately $300 million of annual Adjusted EBITDA benefit by 2017, our optimization efforts may fail toachieve
 expected results. Our Profit Growth Plan is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actualAdjusted EBITDA benefit may differ 
materially from what we anticipate.

.   In connection with the initial public offering of MGM China, the holding company that indirectly owns and operates MGM Macau, we enteredinto
 a  Deed  of  Non-Compete  Undertakings  with  MGM  China  and  Ms.  Ho,  Pansy  Catilina  Chiu  King  (“Ms.  Pansy  Ho”)  pursuant  to  which  we  arerestricted
 from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the People’s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other thanthrough
 MGM China.  While gaming is currently prohibited in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete inthese
 locations could be limited until the earliest of (i) March 31, 2020, (ii) the date MGM China’s ordinary shares cease to be listed on The StockExchange

 non-c ompliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  with  applicable  Macau  laws  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  basic  obligations  under  thesubconcession contract.
  MGM Grand Paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such non-compliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession
 contract  within  a  period  to  be  stipulated  by  the  Macau  government.   Upon  such  termination,  all  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  casino  areapremises
 and gaming-related equipment would be transferred automatically to the Macau government without compensati on  to MGM Grand Paradise,and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations.  We cannot assure y
ou that MGM Grand Paradise will perform all of its obligationsunder the subconcession contra
ct in a way that satisfies the requirements of the Macau government.   
Furthermore,
 under the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the Macau governmentmight
 promulgate in the future.  We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that theselaws
 and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our Macau businesses.  If any disagreement arises between MGMGrand
 Paradise  and  the  Macau  government  regarding  the  interpretation  of,  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  compliance  with,  a  provision  of  thesubconcession
 contract,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  relying  on  a  consultation  and  negotiation  process  with  the  Macau  government.   During  anyconsultation or
 negotiation, MGM Grand Paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the Macaugovernment.
  Currently, there is no precedent concerning how the Macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession uponthe
 occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above.  The loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations inMacau, which would have a mater
ial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
In
 addition, the subconcession contract expires on March 31, 2020.  Unless the subconcession is extended, or legislation with regard to reversion ofcasino
 premises  is  amended,  all  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  casino  premises  and  gaming-related  equipment  will  automatically  be  transferred  to  theMacau
 government on that date without compensation to us, and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations.  Beginning onApril
 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice.  In the event the Macaugovernment
 exercises this redemption right, MGM Grand Paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity.  The amount of such compensation orindemnity
 will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by MGM Grand Paradise, excluding the conventionand
 exhibition  facilities,  during the taxable  year  prior to the redemption,  before deducting  interest,  depreciation  and amortization,  multiplied  by thenumber of remaining years before expiration of the subconcessi
on.  We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to renew or extend thesubconcession
 contract on terms favorable to MGM Grand Paradise or at all.  We also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed, thecompensation paid to MGM Grand Paradis

·MGM
Grand
Paradise
is
dependent
upon
gaming
promoters
for
a
significant
portion
of
gaming
revenues
in
Macau
. Gaming promoters, who promotegaming
 and draw high-end customers to casinos, are responsible for a significant portion of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming revenues in Macau.  Withthe
 rise in gaming in Macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in Macau and in the number of VIP rooms operatedby
 licensed gaming promoters, the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased.  While MGM Grand Paradise is undertakinginitiatives
 to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain, or grow, relationships withgaming
 promoters.  In addition, continued reductions in, and new regulations governing, the gaming promoter segment may result in the closure ofadditional VIP rooms in Macau, in
cluding VIP rooms at MGM Macau. If MGM Grand Paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gamingpromoters,
 or  if  gaming  promoters  are  unable  to  develop  or  maintain  relationships  with  our  high-end  customers  (or  if,  as  a  result  of  recent  marketconditions
 in Macau, gaming promoters encounter difficulties attracting patrons to come to Macau), MGM Grand Paradise’s ability to grow gamingrevenues will be hampered.  Fur
thermore, if existing VIP rooms at MGM Macau are closed there can be no 
17

  
assurance  that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to locate acceptable gaming promoters to run such VIP rooms in the future in a timely manner, or atall. 
  
In
 addition, the quality of gaming promoters is important to MGM Grand Paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliancewith gaming
 licenses.  While MGM Grand Paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters, we cannot assure you that the gamingpromoters
 with whom MGM Grand Paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon.  If a gaming promoter falls belowMGM
 Grand  Paradise’s  standards,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  or  we  may  suffer  reputational  harm  or  possibly  sanctions  from  gaming  regulators  withauthority over our operat
ions.

in

.
 We currently have significant foreign tax credit deferred tax assets resulting from taxcredit
 carryforwards that are available to reduce potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferredtax
 asset  for  recoverability  and  record  a  valuation  allowance  to  the  extent  that  we  determine  it  is  not  more  likely  than  not  such  asset  will  berecovered.
  This evaluation is based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability of and distributions from MGM China, aswell
 as  our  assumption  concerning  renewals  of  the  five-year exemption  from  Macau’s  12%  complementary  tax  on  gaming  profits. As  a  result,significant
 judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have amaterial impact on the
 amount of the valuation allowance.  For example, should we in a future period actually receive  or be able to assume an additionalfive-year
 exemption, an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit deferred taxasset,
 resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material.  In addition, a change to our forecastsof
 future profitability of and distributions from MGM China could also result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a correspondingimpact on the provision for 
income taxes in such period. 
Finally, while we do not currently
 rely on future U.S. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to our recent historyof
 cumulative losses in the U.S., if the recent improvement in U.S. operating results continues, we could in a future period begin to rely on future U.S.source
 operating income for such purpose which could result in a reduction in the valuation allowance and a corresponding reduction in the provisionfor income taxes in such pe
riod.   
 
·Extreme
weather
conditions
or
climate
change
may
cause
property
damage
or
interrupt
business,
which
could
harm
our
business
and
results
ofoperations
.   Certain  of  our casino  properties  are  located  in  areas  that  may be  subject  to  extreme  weather  conditions,  including,  but not  limited  to,hurricanes
 in the United States and severe typhoons in Macau.  Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our properties,and reduce the
 number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas.  In addition, our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or othercause
 of water shortage.  A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adverselyaffect
 our  business  and  results  of  operations.  Although  we  maintain  both  property  and  business  interruption  insurance  coverage  for  certain  extremeweather
 conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for businessinterruption,
 and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extremeweather conditions.  Furthermo
re, such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to ouraffected
 properties  to  decrease  for  an  indefinite  period,  which  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  ofoperations and cash flows.
 
 
·Because
a
majority
of
our
major
gaming
resorts
are
concentrated
on
the
Las
Vegas
Strip,
we
are
subject
to
greater
risks
than
a
gaming
company
that
ismore
geographically
diversifi
ed
.   Given that a majority of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business may be significantlyaffected
 by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry.  For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events thatdisrupt
 air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business.  We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas,but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors.  Reducti
ons in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demandcan impact the number o
f visitors to our resorts.  Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway 
18

  
between  Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large number of our customers reside.  Capacity constraints of that highway or any other trafficdisruptions may also affe
ct the numb er of customers who visit our f acilities.   
 
·We
extend
credit
to
a
large
portion
of
our
customers
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
collect
gaming
receivables
.   We conduct a portion of our gamingactivities
 on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments.  Table games players typically are issued more markersthan
 slot players, and high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts.  High-end gaming is morevolatile than other forms
 of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impacton
 cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.  Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customerscould have an adverse effect
 on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.  We issue markers to those customers whose levelof
 play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit.  In addition, MGM Grand Paradise extends credit tocertain
 gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers.  Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers and gamingpromoters could have a signi
ficant impact on our results of operations. 
While gaming
 debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgments ongaming
 debts  are  enforceable  in  all  states  under  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause  of  the  U.S.  Constitution,  other  jurisdictions  may  determine  thatenforcement
 of gaming debts is against public policy.  Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in theU.S.
 of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts ofmany foreign nations.
 
Furthermore,
 we expect that MGM Macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau.  To theextent
 MGM Macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions, MGM Macau may not have access to a forum in which itwill
 be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGMMacau
 may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts.  Moreover, under applicable law, MGM Macau remains obligated to pay taxes onuncollectible winnings fro
m customers. 
Even where gaming debts are en
forceable, they may not be collectible.  Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact onour operating results.
 
 
·We
may
incur
impairments
to
goodwill,
indefinite-lived

assets,
or
long-lived
assets
which
could
negatively
affect
our
future
profits
.   Wereview our
 goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritativeguidance.
  Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth haveresulted
 in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges orwrite-downs
 may be required in future periods. For instance, in 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.5 billion to reduce the historicalcarrying
 value of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit. If we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, thiscould have a materia
l adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. 
·Leisure

travel
by

, are
particularly
susceptible
to
global
geopolitical
events
, such
as
terrorist
attacks
or
acts
of
waror

hostility
.   We are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air.  Since most of our customers travel by air to our Las Vegas andMacau
 properties,  any terrorist act, outbreak of hostilities,  escalation of war, or any actual  or perceived threat  to the security  of travel by air couldadversely
 affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Furthermore, although we have been able to purchase some insurancecoverage
 for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorismcontinues to be unavailabl
e. 
 
·Co-investing
in
our
properties,
including
our
investment
in
CityCenter,
decreases
our
ability
to
manage
risk
.   In addition to acquiring or developinghotels
 and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest,as
 a co-investor.  Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property.  Therefore, the operation of such properties is subject toinherent
 risk  due  to  the  shared  nature  of  the  enterprise  and  the  need  to  reach  agreements  on  material  matters.   In  addition,  investments  with  otherinvestors may involve risks such 
as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations,or have economic
 or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to ourinstructions or
 requests or contrary to our policies or objectives.  Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject hotels and resorts owned by suchentities to additiona
l risk.  Further, 
19

  
we  may be unable to take action with out  the approval of our co-investors.  Alternatively, our co-investors could take actions binding on the propertywithout our consent.  Additionally, should 
a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.   
For
 instance, CityCenter, which is 50% owned and managed by us, has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect its businessand its
 ability to meet its obligations.  If CityCenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our co-investor are unable to support futurefunding
 requirements, as necessary, such event could have adverse financial consequences to us.  In addition, the agreements governing CityCenter’sindebtedness
 subject CityCenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on its ability to incuradditional
 indebtedness,  place  liens  upon  assets,  make  distributions  to  us,  make  certain  investments,  consummate  certain  asset  sales,  enter  intotransactions
 with affiliates (including us) and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose ofall
 or  substantially  all  of  its  assets.   The  CityCenter  third  amended  and  restated  credit  facility  also  includes  certain  financial  covenants  that  requireCityCenter
 to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in CityCenter’s third amended and restated credit facility) for each quarter.  Wecannot be sure that CityCente
r will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test. 
 
·Any
of
our
future
construction,
development
or
expansion
projects
will
be
subject
to
significant
development
and
construction
risks,
which
could
have
amaterial
adverse
impact
on
related
pro
ject
timetables,
costs
and
our
ability
to
complete
the
projects
.  
Any of our future construction, dev
elopment or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks, including: 
 
· lack of sufficient, or d elays in the availability of, financing; 
· changes to plans and specifi cations; 
· engineering problems, inc luding defective plans and specifications; 
· shortages of, and price inc reases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets; 
· delays in obtaining or inabi lity to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals; 
· changes  in  laws  and  regulations,  or  in  the  interpretation  and  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations,  applicable  to  gaming,  leisure,residential, real 
estate development or construction projects; 
· labor disputes or work stoppages;  
· disputes with and defaults by cont ractors and subcontractors; 
· personal injuries to workers and other persons; 
· environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses; 
· weather interferen ces or delays; 
· fires, typhoons and other natur al disasters; 
· geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and 
· other unanticipated circumstance s or cost increases. 
The
 occurrence  of  any  of  these  development  and  construction  risks  could  increase  the  total  costs,  delay  or  prevent  the  construction,  development,expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future pr
ojects which we might undertake.  For instance, we currently expect thetotal
 development  costs  of  our  Cotai  project  to  be  approximately  $3.0  billion,  excluding  development  fees  eliminated  in  consolidation,  capitalizedinterest and land-re
lated costs.  We currently expect total development costs of our Maryland project to be approximately $1.3 billion, total developmentcosts
 of our Massachusetts project to be approximately $865 million and total development costs of our T-Mobile Arena project to be approximately$350
 million,  each  excluding  capitalized  interest  and  land  related  costs.   While  we  believe  that  the  overall  budgets  for  these  developments  arereasonable,
 these  development  costs  are  estimates  and  the  actual  development  costs  may  be  higher  than  expected.   We  cannot  guarantee  that  ourconstruction
 costs or total project costs for future projects, including our developments in Cotai, Maryland and Massachusetts, will not increase beyondamounts
 initially budgeted or that the expected design and features of current or future projects will not change. In addition, the regulatory approvalsassociated with our development projects may require us to ope
n future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meetthose deadlines, and any such deadlines are
 not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incurpayment penalties in conn
ection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
·Our
insurance
coverage
may
not
be
adequate
to
cover
all
possible
losses
that
our
properties
could
suffer.

In
addition,
our
insurance
costs
may
increaseand

we
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
similar
insurance
coverage
in
the
future
.   Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operatingproperties,
 which  covers  damage  caused  by  a  casualty  loss  (such  as  fire,  natural  disasters,  acts  of  war,  or  terrorism),  each  policy  has  certainexclusions.  In addition, our prope
rty insurance 
20

  
coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the f acilities if the re was a total loss.  Our levelof
 insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events, such as laborstrikes;
 nuclear events; acts of war; loss of income d ue  to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism; loss of electricalpower due to catastrophic events,  rolling blackouts or otherwise; deterioratio
n or corrosion; insect or animal damage; and pollution, may not be coveredat 
all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.   
In
 addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject toclaims
 by third parties that may be injured or harmed.  While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurancemay not be adequate to cove
r all losses in any such event. 
We
 renew our insurance policies (other than our builder’s risk insurance) on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we mayneed to further reduce ou
r policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. 
 
·Any

to
protect
our
trademarks
could
have
a
negative

names
and
adversely
affect
our
business
.   Thedevelopment
 of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of oursuccess.
  While  our business as a whole is not substantially  dependent  on any one trademark  or combination  of several  of our trademarks  or otherintellectual
 property,  we  seek  to  establish  and  maintain  our  proprietary  rights  in  our  business  operations  through  the  use  of  trademarks.   We  fileapplications for,
 and obtain trademarks in, the United States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate.  Despiteour
 efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable.  The laws of someforeign
 countries  do  not  protect  proprietary  rights  to  as  great  an  extent  as  the  laws  of  the  United  States.   Monitoring  the  unauthorized  use  of  ourintellectual
 property is difficult.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of theproprietary
 rights of others.  Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the stepswe
 have  taken  to  protect  our  trademarks  in  the  United  States  and  foreign  countries  will  be  adequate  to  prevent  imitation  of  our  trademarks  byothers.
  The  unauthorized  use  or  reproduction  of  our  trademarks  could  diminish  the  value  of  our  brand  and  its  market  acceptance,  competitiveadvantages or goodwill, which could adv
ersely affect our business.

  As of December 31, 2015, Tracinda Corporation beneficially owned approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock and as a result, Tracindamay
 be  able  to  exercise  significant  influence  over  any  matter  requiring  stockholder  approval,  including  the  approval  of  significant  corporatetransactions.
 Upon Mr. Kerkorian’s passing, Tracinda’s position in our common stock became subject to the terms of Mr. Kerkorian’s last will andtestament, which provides fo

·We
are
subject
to
risks
associated
with
doing
business
outside
of
the
United
States
. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks thatare
 inherent in conducting business under non-United States laws, regulations and customs.  In particular, the risks associated with the operation ofMGM Macau or any future operat
ions in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include: 
 
· changes in laws and policies th at govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions; 
· changes in non-United States govern ment programs; 
· possible failure  by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Actand similar anti-bribery law
s in other jurisdictions; 
· general economic condi tions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements; 
· difficulty in establ ishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations; 
· different labor regulations;  
· changes in environmental, h ealth and safety laws; 
· outbreaks of diseases or epid emics; 
· potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; 
· political instability and actual  or anticipated military and political conflicts; 
· economic instability and i nflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and 
· uncertainties rega rding judicial systems and procedures. 
These risks, individually or in 
the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
21

  
We
 are  also  exposed  to  a  variety  of  market  risks,  including  the  effects  of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.   If  the  United  States  dollarstrengthens
 in relation to the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in thecurrencies of other such 
countries will decrease. 
 
·Any
violation
of
the
Foreign
Corrupt
Practices
Act
or
any
other
similar
anti-corruption
laws
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
us
.  A significant portion of
 our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border
 business  and  in  each  of  the  countries  in  which  we  transact  business.   We  are  subject  to  compliance  with  the  United  States  Foreign  CorruptPractices
 Act  (“FCPA”)  and  other  similar  anti-corruption  laws,  which  generally  prohibit  companies  and  their  intermediaries  from  making  improperpayments
 to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  While our employees and agents are required to complywith
 these  laws,  we  cannot  be  sure  that  our  internal  policies  and  procedures  will  always  protect  us  from  violations  of  these  laws,  despite  ourcommitment
 to legal compliance and corporate ethics.  Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal andcivil
 sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of theFCPA.
  The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, andresults of operations.
 
 
·We
face
risks
related

claims
that
have
been
, or
future
claims
that
may
be
, brought
against
us
.  Claims have been brought agains t us and oursubsidiaries
 in various legal proceedings,  and additional legal and tax claims  arise from time to time.  We may not be successful  in the defense orprosecution
 of  our  current  or  future  legal  proceedings,  which  could  result  in  settlements  or  damages  that  could  significantly  impact  our  business,financial
 condition and results of operations.  Please see the further discussion in “Legal Proceedings” and Note 11 in the accompanying consolidatedfinancial statements. 
  
 
·A
significant
portion
of
our
labor
force
is
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
.   Work stoppages and other labor problems could negativelyaffect
 our business and results of operations.  As of December 31, 2015, approximately 29,900 of our employees are covered by collective bargainingagreements.
  A  prolonged  dispute  with  the  covered  employees  or  any  labor  unrest,  strikes  or  other  business  interruptions  in  connection  with  labornegotiations
 or others could have an adverse impact on our operations.  Further, adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging couldfurther harm our
 reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements maybe
 significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations.  In addition, to the extent that our non-union employees join unions,we would have greater exposure to 
risks associated with labor problems. 
 
·Our
business
is
particularly
sensitive
to
energy
prices
and
a
rise
in
energy
prices
could
harm
our
operating
results
. We are  a  large  consumer  ofelectricity
 and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Accordingly, increases inenergy
 costs may have a negative impact on our operating results.  Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers mayresult in reduced visit
ation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues. 
 
·The
failure
to
maintain
the

of
reputation
and/or
subject
usto

, payment
of
damages
, lawsuits
or

on
our
use
or
transfer
of
data
.   We collect and store information relating to our employees andguests
 for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacylaws
 and regulations enacted in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world.  Privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion maybe inconsistent from one ju
risdiction to another. 
Compliance
 with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, propertiesand
 services to our guests.  In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by thirdparties
 engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our datamay
 result in damage of reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. We rely onproprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing
, transmission and storage of customerand
 employee  information,  such  as  payment  card  and  other  confidential  or  proprietary  information.  Our  data  security  measures  are  reviewed  andevaluated
 regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats. In addition, while we maintain cyberrisk insurance to assist in 
the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient .  
We
 also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses.  Disruptions in the availabilityof our computer systems, through 
cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to 
22

 service
 our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results  of operations.  For instance, there has been an increase in criminal cyber securityattacks
 against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed.  Our informationsystems
 and records, inc luding  those we maintain with our third-party service providers, may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future.  Inaddition,
 our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours, and we do no t  directly control any ofsuch
 parties’ information security operations.   A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party
 service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material  disruption to our operations and management team, and result inremediation
 expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks, all of whichcould have a materia
l adverse eff ect on our business, results of ope rations and cash flows. 
 
·We
may
seek
to
expand
through

and
we
may
also
seek
to

and
other
assets,
any
of
which
may
be
unsuccessful
.   We  intend  to consider  strategic  and  complementary  acquisitions  andinvestments
 in  other  businesses,  properties  or  other  assets.   Furthermore,  we  may  pursue  any  of  these  opportunities  in  alliance  with  thirdparties.
  Acquisitions and investments in businesses, properties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business,including risks related 
to: 
 
· spending cash and incurring debt;  
· assuming contingent liabi lities; 
· unanticipated issues in in tegrating information, communications and other systems; 
· unanticipated incompa tibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods; 
· retaining key employees ; and 
· consolidating corporate a nd administrative infrastructures. 
We
 cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we willactually realiz
e any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. 
 
·If
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
increase
gaming
taxes
and
fees
, our
results
could
be
adversely
affected
. State and local authorities raise asignificant
 amount  of  revenue  through  taxes  and  fees  on  gaming  activities.   From  time  to  time,  legislators  and  government  officials  have  proposedchanges
 in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry.  Periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budgetdeficits may
 intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes.  If the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gamingtaxes or fees, depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors, our financial conditi
on and results of operations could be materiallyadversely
 affected.   For  instance,  income  generated  from  gaming  operations  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  currently  has  the  benefit  of  a  corporate  taxexemption
 in  Macau,  which  exempts  us  from  paying  the  12%  complementary  tax  on  profits  generated  by  the  operation  of  casino  games.   Thisexemption
 is effective through the end of 2016 and while we believe that we will be granted additional five-year exemptions in the future we cannotassure you that any extensions of 
the tax exemption will be granted.

Securities
and
derivative
litiga
tion.
 In 2009 various shareholders fi led six lawsuits in Nevada federal and state court against the Company and various of itsformer and current directors a
nd officers alleging federal securities laws violations and/or related breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with statements allegedlymade by the defendants during the period Aug
ust 2007 through the date of such lawsuit filings in 2009 (the “class period”). In general, the lawsuits asserted the sameor
 similar allegations, including that during the relevant period defendants artificially inflated the Company’s common stock price by knowingly making materiallyfalse
 and  misleading  statements  and  omissions  to  the  investing  public  about  the  Company’s  financial  statements  and  condition,  operations,  CityCenter,  and  theintrinsic
 value of the Company’s common stock; that these alleged misstatements and omissions thereby enabled certain Company insiders to derive personal profitfrom
 the sale of Company common stock to the public; that defendants caused plaintiffs and other shareholders to purchase Company common stock at artificiallyinflated
 prices;  and  that  defendants  imprudently  implemented  a  share  repurchase  program  to  the  detriment  of  the  Company.  The  lawsuits  sought  unspecifiedcompensatory
 damages, restitution and disgorgement of alleged profits and/or attorneys’ fees and costs in amounts to be proven at trial, as well as injunctive reliefrelated to corporat
e governance.   
The state and federal 
court derivative actions were dismissed pursuant to defendants’ motions. Only two of these lawsuits remain pending. The lawsuits are:

al.(Case
 No. 2:09-cv-02011-LRH-RJJ, filed October 19, 2009) putative class actions under the caption "In re MGM MIRAGE Securities Litigation." The cases na me the
 Company and certain former and current directors and officers as defendants and allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of1934,
 as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. After transf er  of the cases in 2010 to the Honorable Gloria M. Navarro, the courtappointed several employee retirement benefits funds as
 co-lead plaintiffs and their counsel as co-lead and co-liaison counsel.  In January 2011, lead plaintiffs filed aconsolidated
 ame nded  complaint, alleging that between August 2, 2007 and March 5, 2009, the Company, its directors and certain of its officers violated Sections10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Ac
t and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   
In
 September 2013, the court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint. Defendants answered the amended complaint, the courtentered
 a scheduling order and discovery commenced. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification in November 2014. Defendants filed their opposition to classcertification in February 2015. The court heard oral
 argument on the class certification motion on April 21, 2015 and took the matter under advisement.  No trial datewas set in this case.  
 
In
 July 2015, the lead plaintiffs and defendants agreed in principle to settle the securities class actions. In August 2015, the lead plaintiffs and defendantsentered
 into  a  Stipulation  and  Agreement  of  Settlement  (the  “Settlement  Agreement”).  Under  the  terms  of  the  Settlement  Agreement,  the  claims  against  theCompany
 and the named former and current directors and officers will be dismissed with prejudice and released in exchange for a $75 million cash payment by theCompany’s
 directors and officers liability insurers. In August 2015, the lead plaintiffs filed with the court an Unopposed Motion for Preliminary Approval of theSettlement
 Agreement. In September 2015, the court entered an Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement, preliminarily certified the class for settlement purposesonly, established class noti
fication procedures and scheduled a hearing for December 15, 2015 to determine whether to grant final approval to the settlement. 
On
 December 7, 2015, the court entered an order on a stipulation by the parties, which, among other things, continued the approval hearing to January 29,2016
 to allow additional time to provide notice of the settlement to class members. On January 21, 2016, the court again continued the hearing for final settlementapproval,
 to allow the court time to first resolve a then-pending motion by a non-party to compel certain discovery from the lead plaintiffs’ counsel. On January 27,2016, the court denied the mot
ion to compel. The hearing for final settlement approval has been scheduled for March 1, 2016. 
If
 the court grants final approval of the Settlement Agreement and enters the proposed judgment, all claims  in these cases against the Company and theindividual defendants will be
 resolved. In the event that defendants are unable to obtain final court approval of the Settlement Agreement, the Company and all otherdefendants plan to continue 
to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in these securities cases. 
Other.



We  and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other lawsuits, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. We do notbelieve that the outco
me of such pending litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

We
 have not paid dividends on our common stock in the last three fiscal years.  As a holding company with no independent operations, our ability to paydividends
 will depend upon the receipt of dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries.  Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains financial covenantsand
 restrictive covenants that could restrict our ability to pay dividends, subject to certain exceptions.  In addition, the MGM National Harbor and the MGM Chinacredit facilities
 each contain limitations on their ability to pay dividends to us.  Our Board of Directors periodically reviews our policy with respect to dividends, andany
 determination to pay dividends in the future will depend on our financial position, future capital requirements and financial debt covenants and any other factorsdeemed
 necessary by the Board of Directors.  Moreover, should we pay any dividends in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay suchdividends.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND
RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS

  
Executive
Overview
 
Our
 primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resortamenities.
 We own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage.Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash
 or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the abilityof
 our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings.  We makesignificant
 investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features andamenities.
 
According
 to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, Las Vegas visitor volume increased 3%, Las Vegas Strip REVPAR increased 3% and LasVegas
 Strip gaming revenue decreased less than 1% in the year ended December 31, 2015. Results of operations for our wholly owned domestic resorts during 2015benefited from
 an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and REVPAR. Our rooms revenue benefited from increased visitation tothe
 Las Vegas market and robust convention business at our Las Vegas Strip resorts, which resulted in increases in occupancy and allowed us to yield higher roomrates across our portfol
io of resorts. 
Gross
 gaming revenues in the Macau market decreased 34% in 2015 compared to 2014.  We believe operating results have been negatively affected byeconomic
 conditions  and  certain  policy  initiatives  in  China  and  the  implementation  of  a  full  main  floor  casino  smoking  ban  in  October  2014.  Additionally,  webelieve
 stricter  enforcement  of  entrance  into  Macau  via  the  use  of  transit  visas,  as  well  as  a  decrease  in  duration  of  stay  permitted  for  transit  visa  holders,  hasnegatively
 affected operating results; however, restrictions surrounding the use of transit visas were eased in July 2015. The decrease in gross gaming revenuesaccelerated
 during the second half of 2014 and continued throughout 2015 as Macau has become an increasingly challenging and competitive market, impactingprimarily
 VIP casino gaming operations and, to a lesser extent, main floor operations. According to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of theMacau
 Government, visitor arrivals decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014. Despite concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth inChina,
 we  expect  the  Macau  market  to  grow  on  a  long-term  basis  due  to  further  development  and  penetration  of  the  mainland  China  market  and  infrastructureimprovements expected to facilitate
 more convenient travel to and within Macau.   
Our
 results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital.  While we continueto
 be focused on improving our financial position, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities. In Macau, we plan to spend approximately$3.0
 billion, excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs, to develop MGM Cotai, a resort and casino withcapacity
 for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms, built on an approximately 18 acre site on the Cotai Stripin
 Macau.  The actual number of gaming tables allocated to MGM Cotai will be determined by the Macau government prior to opening, and such allocation may beless than our 500 gaming table 
capacity.   MGM Cotai is expected to open at the end of the first quarter of 2017. 
We
 were  awarded  the  sixth  and  final  casino  license  under  current  statutes  in  the  State  of  Maryland  by  the  Maryland  Video  Lottery  Facility  LocationCommission
 to  build  and  operate  MGM  National  Harbor,  a  destination  casino  resort  in  Prince  George’s  County  at  National  Harbor,  which  is  a  waterfrontdevelopment
 located on the Potomac River just outside of Washington, D.C. We currently expect the cost to develop and construct MGM National Harbor to beapproximately
 $1.3 billion, excluding capitalized interest and land related costs. We designed the resort to include a casino with approximately 3,600 slots and 160table
 games including poker; a 300-room hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool; 93,100 square feet of high-end branded retail and fine and casual dining; a 3,000-seat theater
 venue; 50,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 4,700-space parking garage. We expect MGM National Harbor to open in the fourth quarterof 2016.
 
We
 were  awarded  a  casino  license  to  build  and  operate  MGM  Springfield  in  Springfield,  Massachusetts.  MGM  Springfield  will  be  developed  onapproximately
 14 acres of land in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM’s plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3,000 slots and100
 table games including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,375-space
 parking  garage;  with  an  expected  development  and  construction  cost  of  approximately  $865  million,  excluding  capitalized  interest  and  land-related  costs.Construction of MGM Springfield is expe
cted to be completed in late 2018. 
We
 entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. (“AEG”) to design, construct, and operate an arena, which will belocated
 on a parcel of our land between Frank Sinatra Drive and New York-New York, adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip. We and AEG each own 50% of Las VegasArena Company, the developer of th
e arena. In September 2014, a wholly 
30

 owned subsidiary
 of Las Vegas Arena Company entered into a $200 million senior secured credit facility to finance const ruction of the arena. The Las Vegas Arena Company
 recently entered into a multi-year naming rights  agreement with T-Mobile. T-Mobile  Arena will seat between 18,000 and 20,000 people and is scheduledto
 open in the April 2016. Such development is estimated to  cost approximately $350 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. In addition, weare building The Park enter
tainment district which connects to New York-New York, Monte Carlo and T-Mobile Arena. 
In
 August  2015,  we  announced  the  implementation  of  a  Profit  Growth  Plan  for  sustained  growth  and  margin  enhancement.  The  Profit  Growth  Plan’sinitiatives
 are focused on improving business processes to optimize our scale for greater efficiency and lower cost throughout our business, and to identify areas ofopportunity
 to organically drive incremental revenue growth. The Profit Growth Plan includes a large number of opportunities to enhance our business operationsand we continue to explore addi
tional opportunities to drive further margin enhancements. The plan is expected to result in approximately $300 million of annualizedAdjusted EBITDA benefit. The Profit Growth Plan has begun 
to show significant results and is expected to be fully realized by the end of 2017. 
On October 29, 2015, we ann
ounced the formation of MGP as a newly formed subsidiary that we expect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)for U.S. federal income tax pu
rposes. We intend to contribute to a newly-formed operating partnership that MGP will control through a general partner subsidiary thereal
 estate associated with Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, New York-New York, Luxor, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage andGold
 Strike Tunica (collectively, the “Properties”). We also intend to incur approximately $4 billion of debt to refinance a portion of the debt outstanding under ourexisting senior
 credit facility and senior notes, which refinancing debt would be assumed by the operating partnership in connection with the REIT transactions. Oneof our subsidiaries will then 
lease the Properties from MGP for use under a long-term, “triple net” master lease agreement with a 10-year term that includes four five-year
 extensions at our option. We will guarantee our subsidiary’s obligations under the master lease. We expect to retain through subsidiaries an approximate 70%economic interest in 
the new operating partnership, as well as voting control of MGP through our ownership of a controlling share in MGP. 
Reportable
Segments
 
We
 have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate: wholly owned domestic resorts and MGM China. We currently operate12
 wholly owned resorts in the United States. MGM China’s operations consist of MGM Macau resort and the development of MGM Cotai on the Cotai Strip inMacau.
 We have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates, our MGM Hospitality operations and certain other corporate andmanagement
 operations. CityCenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee.  Our operations that are not segregated intoseparate reportabl
e segments are reported as “corporate and other” operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results. 
Wholly
owned
domestic
resorts.
At December 31, 2015, our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts: 
Las Vegas, Nevada:
  
Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons),The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Excalibur, Monte Ca
rlo and Circus Circus Las Vegas.Other:
  
MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica,Mississippi.
 
Over
 half  of  the  net  revenue  from  our  wholly  owned  domestic  resorts  is  derived  from  non-gaming  operations  including  hotel,  food  and  beverage,entertainment
 and other non-gaming amenities. We market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximizehotel
 occupancy and customer volumes during off-peak times such as mid-week or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods, which also leads to better laborutilization.  Our
 operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services, and the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects the price we cancharge
 for our hotel rooms and other amenities.  Also, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts in Las Vegas,Nevada,
 which exposes us to certain risks, such as increased competition from new or expanded Las Vegas resorts, and from the expansion of gaming in the UnitedStates generally.
 
Key performance indica
tors related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are: 
 
·Gaming  revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us.Our normal table
 games hold percentage is in the range of 18% to 22% of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is approximately 8.5%of slots handle; and
 
 
31

  
·Hotel  revenue  indicators:  hotel  occupancy  (a  volume  indicator);  average  daily  rate  (“ ADR,”  a  price  indicator);  and  revenue  per  available  room(“REVPAR,”
 a  summary  measure  of  hotel  results,  combining  ADR  and  occupancy  rate).  Our  calculation  of  ADR,  which  is  the  average  price  ofoccupied
 rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary ro oms.  Complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or“cash”
 rates  for  each  customer  segment  and  each  type  of  room  product  to  estimate  complimentary  rates  which  are  consistent  with  retail  rates.Complimentary
 rates are reviewed at least  annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. Because the mix ofrooms provided
 on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR inclu ding complimentary rooms is s
lightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.   
MGM

China.
We  own a 51% controlling interest in MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, the Macau company that owns and operates MGMMacau
 and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions, and is in the process of developing MGM Cotai, an integrated casino, hotel, and entertainmentresort
 on the Cotai Strip in Macau.  We believe our investment in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster futuregrowth and profitability.
 
Revenues
 at MGM Macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the Macau gaming market: VIP casino gaming operations, main floorgaming
 operations, and slot machine operations. VIP players play mostly in dedicated VIP rooms or designated gaming areas. VIP customers can be further dividedinto
 customers sourced by in-house VIP programs and those sourced through gaming promoters. A significant portion of our VIP volume is generated through theuse
 of gaming promoters. Gaming promoters introduce VIP gaming players to MGM Macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gamingcredit
 to these players. In exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements or rolling chip turnoverbased
 commissions.  In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate.  MGM Macau main floor operationsprimarily
 consist of walk-in and day trip visitors. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions.  The profitcontribution
 from  the  main  floor  segment  exceeds  the  VIP  segment  due  to  commission  costs  paid  to  gaming  promoters. Gaming  revenues  from  the  main  floorsegment
 have become an increasingly significant portion of total gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential forsustainable growth in the futu
re. 
VIP
 gaming at MGM Macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chipsfrom MGM Macau
 and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow MGM Macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by eachgaming
 promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play.  Gaming promoter commissions are based on either a percentage of actual win plus a monthlycomplimentary
 allowance based on a percentage of the rolling chip turnover their customers generate, or a percentage of the rolling chip turnover plus discountedofferings on
 nongaming amenities. The estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to VIP customers is recorded as areduction
 of  casino  revenue,  and  the  estimated  portion  retained  by  the  gaming  promoter  for  its  compensation  is  recorded  as  casino  expense.   In-house  VIPcommissions are based on a pe
rcentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. 
In
 addition  to  the  key  performance  indicators  used  by  our  wholly  owned  domestic  resorts,  MGM  Macau  utilizes  “turnover,”  which  is  the  sum  ofnonnegotiable chip wagers won by MGM Macau calculated as nonneg
otiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned.Turnover
 provides a basis for measuring VIP casino win percentage.  Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM Macau is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.0% ofturnover.

Corporate  and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations.

  (156,232 )   1,323,538    1,137,281  
 
Consolidated
 net revenues for 2015 decreased 9% compared to 2014 due primarily to a decrease in casino revenue at MGM China, offset by increases incasino and non-casino revenue at
 our wholly owned domestic resorts. Consolidated net revenues for 2014 increased 3% compared to 2013 due primarily to increasedcasino and non-casino revenue 
at our wholly owned domestic resorts. 
Consolidated
 operating  loss of $156 million  in 2015 was negatively  affected  by an operating  loss for MGM China that included a $1.5 billion non-cashimpairment charge to goodwill recognized in the
 acquisition of a controlling interest in MGM China. We recorded a $3.5 billion non-cash gain in 2011 in connectionwith that acquisition. The current impairment charge, which represents appr
oximately 42% of the amount of the previously recognized gain, resulted from our annualreview
 of our goodwill carrying values and was incurred as a result of reduced cash flow forecasts for MGM China’s resorts based on current market conditions andlower valuation
 multiples for gaming assets in the Macau market. In addition, the operating loss was affected by a decrease in operating results at MGM Macau. Theoperating
 loss  for  MGM  China  was  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  operating  income  at  our  wholly  owned  domestic  resorts  and  an  increase  in  income  fromunconsolidated
 affiliates, primarily from CityCenter, which included $80 million related to our share of the gain recognized by CityCenter as a result of the finalresolution of
 its construction litigation and related settlements. In addition, corporate expense increased 15% to $275 million in 2015, due primarily to costs incurred to
 implement initiatives in relation to the Profit Growth Plan of $24 million and costs associated with our proposed REIT transaction of $20 million. Preopening expense
 primarily  related  to  our  ongoing  MGM  Cotai,  MGM  Springfield  and  MGM  National  Harbor  development  projects  increased  to  $71  million  in  2015compared to $39
 million in 2014. Consolidated operating loss in 2015 was also negatively affected by impairment charges and losses on disposal of certain assets, inaddition
 to the MGM China goodwill impairment  charge discussed  above, recorded  in “Property  transactions,  net.” See “Operating  Results – Details  of CertainCharges” below for additional d
etail on our preopening expense and property transactions. 
Consolidated
 operating income of $1.3 billion in 2014 benefited from an increase in revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts and an increase in mainfloor
 table games revenue at MGM China, as well as a decrease in property transactions, net to $41 million in 2014 compared to $125 million in 2013.  In addition,depreciation and amortization expense decreased $33 million in 2014 com
pared to 2013, due primarily to certain assets at our wholly owned resorts and MGM Chinabecoming
 fully depreciated and a decrease in amortization expense for intangible assets.  Operating income was negatively affected by increases in general andadministrative
 expense, corporate expense and preopening expense. General and administrative expense increased primarily related to an increase in payroll andrelated
 expense.  Corporate  expense  increased  10%  in  2014,  due  primarily  to  an  increase  in  payroll  costs  and  professional  fees  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  indevelopment
 related costs. Preopening expense increased to $39 million in 2014, compared to $13 million in 2013, primarily as a result of the commencement ofdevelopment on MGM Springfield and MGM Nation
al Harbor.

 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to an increase in table games volume and slots volume of 2% and 3%,respectively.
 CityCenter’s rooms revenue increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014, due to increases in REVPAR of 6% and 8% at Aria and Vdara, respectively. Theincrease
 in revenues from resort operations was partially offset by a decrease in residential revenues. CityCenter’s operating income in the current year benefitedfrom
 a $99 million decrease in depreciation expense as a result of certain furniture and equipment becoming fully depreciated in December 2014 offset in part by$20
 million in accelerated depreciation for certain assets associated with the Zarkana theatre, which is scheduled to close in April 2016.  CityCenter’s operatingincome
 also benefited from a $26 million decrease in legal and professional fees as a result of the final resolution of construction litigation and related settlements.Our share of Borgata’s operat
ing income increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to an increase in casino and non-casino revenues and improved operating margins. 
In
 2014,  we  recognized  a  $12  million  loss  related  to  our  50%  share  of  CityCenter’s  operating  results,  including  certain  basis  difference  adjustments,compared
 to income of $22 million in 2013. CityCenter’s operating loss in 2014 was negatively affected by $62 million of property transactions, net and a decreasein
 residential sales compared to 2013, as well as an increase in payroll and related costs and casino bad debt expense. Casino revenues at Aria decreased 5% in 2014compared
 to 2013 due primarily to a decrease in table games hold percentage to 23.5% in 2014 from 24.7% in 2013. CityCenter’s rooms revenues increased 11% in2014
 compared to 2013, due to increases in REVPAR of 10% and 14% at Aria and Vdara, respectively.  Our share of Borgata’s operating income increased in 2014compared to 2013 and benefit
ed from a reduction in real estate taxes recognized by Borgata.

In
 2015,  interest  cost  related  to  MGM  Resorts,  excluding  China,  decreased  compared  to  2014  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  the  average  long-term  debtoutstanding
 during the year related to our senior notes. Interest cost related to MGM China increased in 2015 compared to the prior year due to an increase in theaverage
 outstanding amounts borrowed under the MGM China credit facility and an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from costs incurredassociated with
 the refinancing of the MGM China credit facility in June 2015. In 2014, interest cost related to MGM Resorts, excluding China, decreased comparedto
 2013 as a result of a decrease in weighted average long-term debt outstanding during the year, primarily relating to borrowings under our revolving credit facility.Amortization
 of debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs included in interest expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $46 million, $38 million and $35 million,respectively.
 
Capitalized
 interest in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due primarily to the MGM Cotai, National Harbor, and Springfield projects, and our investment inthe Las Vegas Arena Company. Capitali

Non-operating

items
from
unconsolidated
affiliates.
 Non-operating  expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $11 million in 2015 compared to2014,
 due primarily to a decrease in interest expense at CityCenter. Non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $121 million in 2014 comparedto
 2013,  due  to  a  decrease  in  interest  expense  at  CityCenter  as  a  result  of  debt  restructuring  transactions  in  October  2013,  lower  statutory  interest  recorded  byCityCenter related to es
timated amounts owed in connection with the CityCenter construction litigation and the net impact of the following other non-operating itemsfrom
 unconsolidated affiliates recognized in 2013: a $70 million loss for our share of CityCenter’s loss on retirement of long-term debt in October 2013, and $12million for our share of 
a gain recognized on debt restructuring transactions at Silver Legacy.

Our
 effective  tax  rate  in  2015  was  impacted  by  the  non-cash  impairment  charge  on  MGM  China  goodwill  for  which  we  did  not  record  income  taxbenefit.
  Our effective tax rate decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of providing greater tax benefit in 2015 than in 2014 for foreign tax credits,net
 of  valuation  allowance,  partially  offset  by  tax  benefit  resulting  from  audit  settlements  in  2014.  Our  effective  tax  rate  increased  in  2014  compared  to  2013primarily
 as a result of the reduced tax benefit in 2014 for foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowance, partially offset by tax provision in 2013 resulting from re-measuring
 the Macau net deferred tax liability due to the extension of the amortization period of the MGM China gaming subconcession upon effectiveness of theCotai land concession.
 
Cash
 taxes paid decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a $16 million refund of taxes and associated interest received in 2015 on theclosure
 of the IRS examination  of CityCenter, which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes which partially offset federal income tax estimated taxpayments of $23 million mad
e during the year.  The remaining $5 
38

 million of cash taxes paid in 2015 consist of state and foreign income taxes. Cash t 
axes paid increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily  as a result of $30 millionpaid to
 IRS for the closure of examinations covering the 2005 through 2009 tax years and $8 million estimated taxes paid to the IRS during 2014.  The remaining $4million of 
cash taxes paid in 2014 consist of s tate and foreign income taxes. Cash taxes paid in 2013 consisted primarily of foreign and state taxes. 
Non-GAAP
Measures
 
“Adjusted
 EBITDA” is  earnings  before  interest  and  other  non-operating  income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  preopening  and  start-upexpenses,
 and property transactions, net. “Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related tothe
 MGM  Resorts  stock  option  plan,  which  is  not  allocated  to  each  reportable  segment  or  operating  segment,  as  applicable.  MGM  China  recognizes  stockcompensation
 expense related to its stock compensation plan which is included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for MGM China. Adjusted EBITDA andAdjusted
 Property EBITDA information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes these measuresare
 1)  widely  used  measures  of  operating  performance  in  the  gaming  and  hospitality  industry,  and  2)  a  principal  basis  for  valuation  of  gaming  and  hospitalitycompanies.
 
We
 believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded inevaluation
 of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these itemscan
 vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, we believeexcluded
 items  may  not  relate  specifically  to  current  operating  trends  or  be  indicative  of  future  results.  For  example,  preopening  and  start-up  expenses  will  besignificantly
 different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within thedevelopment
 cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assetsrelated
 to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges onentire
 asset  groups  or  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  which  may  not  be  comparable  period  over  period.  In  addition,  capital  allocation,  tax  planning,financing
 and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level. Therefore, we use Adjusted Property EBITDA as the primary measure of whollyowned domestic resorts opera
ting performance. 
Adjusted
 EBITDA  or  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  should  not  be  construed  as  an  alternative  to  operating  income  or  net  income,  as  an  indicator  of  ourperformance;
 or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting pr
inciples. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, whichare
 not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA. Also, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAor Adjusted Property EBITDA information m
ay calculate Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA in a different manner.

Summary
 
We
 require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts.  In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize company-wide cashmanagement procedures 
to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks.  Funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into central bank accounts, andexcess
 funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds torepurchase
 our outstanding debt securities subject to limitations in our senior credit facility.  At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we held cash and cash equivalents of$1.7 billion. Cash and cash equivalen
ts related to MGM China at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $700 million and $546 million, respectively.

Operating
Activities
 
Trends in
 our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital,the timing of signific
ant tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. 
Cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decrea
sed due to a decrease in operating cash flows at MGM China which were $383 million in 2015 comparedto
 $642 million in 2014, partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows at our wholly owned domestic resorts.  In 2015, cash provided by operating activitiesat MGM China was negatively affe
cted by changes in working capital related to short term gaming liabilities but to a lesser extent than in 2014. 
Cash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased due
 to a decrease in operating cash flows at MGM China compared to $932 million in 2013, partiallyoffset
 by an increase in operating cash flows at our wholly owned domestic resorts and lower cash paid for interest. Cash provided by operating activities at MGMChina
 was  negatively  affected  by  changes  in  working  capital  related  to  short-term  gaming  liabilities  in  2014  while  operating  cash  flows  at  MGM  China  werepositively impacted by ch
anges in working capital in 2013. 
We paid net taxes of $12 mi
llion, $42 million and $1 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Investing
Activities
 
Our
 investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new orexisting
 resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of more regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expendituresrelated to
 more regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.Most of such costs relate to 
construction materials, furniture and fixtures, and external labor costs. 
 
·In  2015, we had capital expenditures of $1.5 billion, which included $579 million at MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized intereston
 development fees eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included  $543 million related to the construction of MGM Cotaiand
 $36 million related to improvements at MGM Macau. Capital  expenditures at our wholly owned domestic resorts and corporate entities of $888million included $361 mil

Other
Factors
Affecting
Liquidity
 
Anticipated

uses
of
cash.
 We  have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures. At December 31,2015,
 we had $1.5 billion of principal amount of long-term debt maturing in 2016, primarily related to our $242.9 million 6.875% senior notes, $732.7 million 7.5%senior
 notes, and $500 million 10% senior notes, and an estimated $750 million of cash interest payments based on current outstanding debt and applicable interestrates, within the next twelv
e months. 
We expect to make the 
following capital investments, excluding capitalized interest, during 2016: 
 
· Approximately  $440 million in capital expenditures at our wholly owned domestic resorts and corporate entities, which includes expenditures on ThePark, the Monte Carlo theatr
e, the new Excalibur parking garage, and replacement of aircraft; 
· Approximately $130 million in capital expenditures related to the MGM Springfield project; and 
· Approximately $680 million in capital expenditures related to the MGM National Harbor project. 
During
 2016, MGM China expects to spend approximately $50 million in capital improvements at MGM Macau and $1.6 billion on the MGM Cotai project,excluding capitalized interest,
 development fees and land related costs. 
Our capital
 expenditures fluctuate depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts and the timing of capitalinvestments
 to maintain the quality of our resorts, the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces andhotel
 rooms. Future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development efforts and the structure of ourownership interests in futur
e developments. 
Cotai

land
concession.
  MGM Grand Paradise’s land concession contract for an approximate 18 acre site in Cotai, Macau became effective on January 9,2013 and
 has an initial term of 25 years. The total land premium payable to the Macau government for the land concession contract is $161 million and is composedof
 a down payment and eight additional semi-annual payments. As of December 31, 2015, MGM China had paid $130 million of the contract premium, includinginterest
 due on the semi-annual payments. In January 2016, MGM China paid the sixth semi-annual payment of $15 million under the land concession contract.Including interest on the 
two remaining semi-annual payments, MGM China has $29 million remaining payable for the land concession contract. 
MGM

China
dividend.
  On February 18, 2016, as part of its regular dividend policy, MGM China’s Board of Directors announced it will recommend afinal
 dividend for 2015 of $46 million to MGM China shareholders subject to approval at the MGM China 2016 annual shareholders meeting to be held in May.  Ifapproved, we will receive $23 m
illion, our 51% share of the 2015 final dividend. 
REIT
transaction.
In  connection with the proposed REIT transaction, we expect to incur approximately $4 billion of debt to refinance a portion of the debtoutstanding
 under our existing senior credit facility and certain of our senior notes, which refinancing debt will be assumed by the Operating Partnership and repaid with the equity proceeds fro
m the contemplated IPO and concurrent debt financings. 
Principal
Debt
Arrangements
 
Our
 long-term debt consists of publicly held senior notes and our senior credit facility.  At December 31, 2015, excluding MGM China, we had $11.3 billionprincipal amount of indebtedness, including $2.7 billion of
 borrowings outstanding under our $3.9 billion senior credit facility. We pay fixed rates of interest rangingfrom
 5.25% to 11.375% on our senior notes.  Our senior credit facility consists of a $1.2 billion revolving loan facility, a $1.02 billion term loan A facility and a$1.70
 billion term loan B facility.  The revolving and term loan A facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable rate determined by our credit rating (2.75% asof December 31,
 2015).  The term loan B facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%.  The revolving and term loan A facilities maturein
 December 2017. The term loan B facility matures in December 2019.  The term loan A and term loan B facilities are subject to scheduled amortization paymentson
 the last day of each calendar quarter in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal balance.  We had approximately $1.2 billion of available borrowingcapacity
 under our senior credit facility at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the interest rate on the term loan A was 3.17% and the interest rate on theterm loan B was 3.50%.

The
 land and substantially all of the assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas, Bellagio and The Mirage secure up to $3.35 billion of obligations outstanding underthe
 senior credit facility.  In addition, the land and substantially all of the assets of New York-New York and Gold Strike Tunica secure the entire amount of thesenior
 credit facility, and the land and substantially all of the assets of MGM Grand Detroit secure its $450 million of obligations as a co-borrower under the seniorcredit
 facility. In addition, the senior credit facility is secured by a pledge of the equity or limited liability company interests of the subsidiaries that own the pledgedproperties.
 
The
 senior credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. In addition, the senior creditfacility
 requires  us  and  our  restricted  subsidiaries  (the  “Restricted  Group”)  to  maintain  a  minimum  trailing  four-quarter  EBITDA  and  limits  the  ability  of  theRestricted
 Group to make capital expenditures and investments. As of December 31, 2015, the Restricted Group is required to maintain a minimum EBITDA (asdefined) of $1.30 billion.  The m
inimum EBITDA increases to $1.35 billion for March 31, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and to $1.40 billion for March 31, 2017and
 thereafter.   EBITDA for the trailing four quarters  ended December  31, 2015 calculated  in accordance  with the terms of the senior credit  facility  was $1.71billion. 
 In accordance with our senior credit facility covenants, the Restricted Group is limited to annual capital expenditures of $500 million in each year beginningwith
 2013  with  unused  amounts  in  any  fiscal  year  rolling  over  to  the  next  fiscal  year,  but  not  any  fiscal  year  thereafter.  Our  total  Restricted  Group  capitalexpenditures
 allowable under the senior credit facility for 2015, after giving effect to the unused amount from 2014, was $794 million. In addition, our senior creditfacility
 limits the Restricted Group’s ability to make investments subject to certain thresholds and other important exceptions. The Restricted Group was within thelimit
 of  capital  expenditures  and  other  investments  for  2015.  We  believe  we  have  sufficient  capacity  under  these  thresholds  to  fund  our  planned  developmentactivity.
 
The
 senior  credit  facility  provides  for  customary  events  of  default,  including,  without  limitation,  (i)  payment  defaults,  (ii)  covenant  defaults,  (iii)  cross-defaults
 to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, (iv) certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, (v) judgment defaults in excess of specifiedamounts,
 (vi) the failure of any loan document by a significant party to be in full force and effect and such circumstance, in the reasonable judgment of the requiredlenders,
 is materially adverse to the lenders, or (vii) the security documents cease to create a valid and perfected first priority lien on any material portion of thecollateral.
 In addition, the senior credit facility provides that a cessation of business due to revocation, suspension or loss of any gaming license affecting a specifiedamount of its revenues or ass
ets, will constitute an event of default. 
All
 of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our material domestic subsidiaries, other than MGM Grand Detroit, LLC (which is a co-borrower
 under our senior credit facility), MGM National Harbor, LLC and Blue Tarp reDevelopment, LLC (the company that will own and operate our proposedcasino
 in Springfield, Massachusetts), and each of their respective subsidiaries. Our international subsidiaries, including MGM China and its subsidiaries, are notguarantors of such
 indebtedness. We and our subsidiaries may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debtsecurities,
 in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise pursuant to authorization of our Board of Directors and in accordancewith the terms of our
 senior credit facilities. 
In
 June 2015, MGM China and MGM Grand Paradise, as co-borrowers, entered into a second amended and restated credit facility which consists of $1.55billion
 of term loans and a $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2015 of $1.6 billion was comprised solely of term loans.The interest rate on th
e facility fluctuates annually based on HIBOR plus a margin that will range between 1.375% and 2.50% based on MGM China’s leverage ratio.The MGM China credit facili
ty is secured by MGM Grand Paradise’s interest in the Cotai land use right, and MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise and their guarantorsubsidiaries have granted a
 security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility. The credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes andfor the development of th
e Cotai project. 
The
 MGM China credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, whichimpose restrictions
 on, among other things, the ability of MGM China and its subsidiaries to make investments, pay dividends and sell assets, and to incur additionalliens. As
 of December 31, 2015, MGM China was required to maintain compliance with a maximum leverage ratio of 4.50 to 1.00 in addition to a minimum interestcoverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00.  MGM China was in 
compliance with the credit facility covenants at December 31, 2015. 
In
 February 2016, the MGM China credit facility was amended to increase the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio. The maximum total leverage ratioincreases
 to 6.00 to 1.00 for September 30, 2016 through June 30, 2017, and then decreases to 5.50 to 1.00 for September 30, 2017, 5.00 to 1.00 for December 31,2017, and 4.50 to 1.00 for March 31, 2018 and there
after.   
In
 January 2016, MGM National Harbor, LLC, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary developing and constructing MGM National Harbor, entered into a$100
 million revolving credit facility and a $425 million delayed draw term loan facility, of which $250 million was funded at closing. The  revolving and term loanfacilities will initially bear interest at a LIBOR rate plus an additional rate ranging from 2.00% to 2.
25% per annum (determined based on a total leverage ratio) . The term loan is subject to
 
45

 scheduled
 amortization payments  on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning the fourth full fiscal quarter following the opening of MGM National Harbor,initially in an amount equal to
 1.25% of the aggregate principal balance and increasing to 1.875% and 2.50% of the aggregate principal balance  on the last day of thetwelfth and sixteenth ful
l fiscal quarters, respectively. The term loan and revolving facilities are scheduled to mature in January 2021. 
The credit agreement is secured by a leasehold mortgage on MGM National Harbor an
d substantially all of the existing and future property of MGM NationalHarbor. Mandatory prepayments wi
ll be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets, casualty events and the incurrence of certainadditional
 indebtedness,  subject  to  certain  exceptions  and  reinvestment  rights.  In  addition,  to  the  extent  MGM  National  Harbor  generates  excess  cash  flow  (asdefined
 in the credit agreement), a percentage of such excess cash flow (ranging from 0% to 50% based on a total leverage ratio) will be required to be used toprepay the term loan facilities c
ommencing with the fiscal year ended 2017.   
The
 credit  agreement  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties,  events  of  default,  affirmative  covenants  and  negative  covenants,  which  imposerestrictions
 on, among other things, the ability of MGM National Harbor, LLC and its restricted subsidiaries to make investments, pay dividends, sell assets, and toincur
 additional  debt  and  additional  liens.  In  addition,  the  credit  agreement  requires  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC  and  its  restricted  subsidiaries  to  maintain  amaximum
 total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a customary “in balance test”(as
 defined in the credit agreement), which looks to the sufficiency of MGM National Harbor, LLC’s available resources to complete the MGM National Harborcasino resort.
 
Off
Balance
Sheet
Arrangements
 
Our
 off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consist primarily of our investments in CityCenter,Grand
 Victoria, Borgata, and T-Mobile Arena.  We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivativetransactions.
  Our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort in a manner that minimizes ourinitial
 investment.  Other than the T-Mobile Arena guarantee described below, we have not historically guaranteed financings obtained by our investees. In addition,there
 are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we hadfull ownership of the resort.
 
In
 conjunction with the Las Vegas Arena Company entering into a senior secured credit facility in September 2014, we and AEG each entered into joint andseveral
 completion guarantees for the project, as well as a repayment guarantee for the term loan B (which is subject to increases and decreases in the event of arebalancing
 of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan A and term loan B facilities).   As of December 31, 2015, term loan A was $120 millionand term loan B was $80 million.

 (5)
The amount for 2016 includes $118 million related to employment agreements, $105 million for entertainment agreements and $77 million of open purchase orders.  Othercommitments
 include various contracted amounts, including information technology, advertising, maintenance and other service agreements. Our largest entertainmentcommitments
 consist of minimum contractual payments to Cirque du Soleil, which performs show s  at several of our resorts.  Our contractual commitments for theseshows
 generally do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability  to exercise certain termination  rights; however, we expect these shows to continue for longerperiods. 
  
While
 we have significant indebtedness, we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations, including principal and interest obligations as well asplanned
 capital expenditures over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits, cash flows from operations, dividendsfrom
 MGM China, and availability under our senior credit facility, the MGM China credit agreement and the MGM National Harbor credit agreement.  We have$1.5
 billion of maturities of long-term debt in 2016.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Other Factors Affecting Liquidity” for further discussion of anticipateduses of cash.
 
Critical
Accounting
Policies
and
Estimates
 
Management’s
 discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements.  Toprepare
 our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimatesand
 assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.  We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly inareas
 we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations,financial
 position or cash flows.  Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about ourcritical account
ing estimates, and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates.  However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree ofuncertainty and therefore actual
 results can differ from our estimates. 
Allowance

Doubtful
Casino
Accounts
Rece
ivable 
Marker play
 represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts.  In addition, MGM China extends credit to certainin-house VIP gaming customers and gaming promoters.  Our
 other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customersat
 those casinos as well. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our other customers who fail to pay theirmarker
 balances timely. These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including themailing of statements and
 delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceableinstruments
 in the United States and Macau. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 37% and 30%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable wasowed
 by  customers  from  the  United  States.  Markers  are  not  legally  enforceable  instruments  in  some  foreign  countries,  but  the  United  States  assets  of  foreigncustomers
 may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 44% and 54%, respectively, of ourcasino
 accounts receivable was owed by customers from the Far East. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when weissue credit to custome
rs who are not residents of the United States. 
We
 maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts.  The provision for doubtful accounts, an operatingexpense,
 increases the allowance for doubtful accounts.  We regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts.  At resorts where marker play is notsignificant, the allowan
ce is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances.  At resorts where marker play is significant, weapply
 standard  reserve  percentages  to  aged  account  balances  under  a  specified  dollar  amount  and  specifically  analyze  the  collectability  of  each  account  with  abalance over the speci
fied dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other known information. 
In
 addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors, including changes incurrency exchange rates and
 economic conditions in the customers’ home countries.  Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the allowanceand the provision can change sign
ificantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur.

 to  MGM  China  at  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  respectively.   The  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  as  a  percentage  of  casino  accounts  receivable  hasincreased in
 the current year due to an increase in specific reserves for high-end gaming customers and an increase in the aging of accounts.  At December 31, 2015,a
 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $2.9million.

Policies 
Property
 and equipment are stated at cost.  For the majority of our property and equipment, cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimatedfair
 values  in  connection  with  the  June  2011  MGM  China  acquisition,  the  April  2005  Mandalay  acquisition  and  the  May  2000  Mirage  Resortsacquisition.
  Maintenance  and  repairs  that  neither  materially  add  to  the  value  of  the  property  nor  appreciably  prolong  its  life  are  charged  to  expense  asincurred.
  Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  When we construct assets, we capitalizedirect
 costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. In addition,interest
 cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project.  Interest is typically capitalized on amountsexpended
 on the project  using the weighted-average  cost of our outstanding borrowings.  Capitalization  of interest  starts when construction  activities  begin andceases when construction is subst
antially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period. 
We
 must  make  estimates  and  assumptions  when  accounting  for  capital  expenditures.   Whether  an expenditure  is  considered  a  maintenance  expense  or  acapital
 asset is a matter of judgment.  When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired,which
 also may be a matter of judgment.  In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated usefullives.  We determine 
the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset.  Wheneverevents or circumstanc
es occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively. 
Impairment
of
Long-lived
Assets,
Goodwill
and
Inde
finite-lived
Intangible
Assets 
We
 evaluate  our  property  and  equipment  and  other  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  based  on  our  classification  as  held  for  sale  or  to  be  held  andused.  Several criteri
a must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell theasset
 at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower ofcarrying
 value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model.  For assetsto
 be held and used, we review  for impairment  whenever  indicators  of impairment  exist.  We then compare  the estimated  future  cash flows of the asset,  on anundiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the as
set.  If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated.  If the undiscounted cashflows
 do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset.  For operating assets, fair value is typically measuredusing
 a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital assetpricing
 model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.  Allrecognized impairm
ent losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. 
There
 are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets.  First, management must determine the usage of theasset. 
 To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized.  Assets must be tested at the lowest levelfor
 which identifiable cash flows exist.  This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets.  Future cashflow estimates are, by t
heir nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. 
 
48

 On
 a  quarterly  basis,  we  review  our  major  long-lived  assets  to  determine  if  events  have  occurred  or  circumstances  exist  that  indicate  a  potential  impairment.
  Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry oreconomic factors,
 significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended us e  of the asset group.  We estimate future cash flows using our internalbudgets
 and probability  weight cash flows in certain  circumstances  to consider  alternative  outcomes  associated  with recoverability  of the  asset  group, includingpotential sale. Histori 
cally, undiscounted cash flows of ou r significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. 
We
 review indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annualimpairment
 test for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily oflicense
 rights, which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks, which are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royaltymethod.  See Note 7 to the accomp
anying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets. 
Goodwill
 represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations.  Goodwill for relevant reportingunits
 is  tested  for  impairment  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  based  on  our  budgeted  future  results  discounted  using  a  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,developed
 using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry, and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, aswell as
 a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group.  If the carrying value of the reporting unitexceeds
 its fair value, an indication of impairment exists and we must proceed to measure an impairment loss, if any. In measuring an impairment loss, the impliedfair
 value of a reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fairvalue
 of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill isless than its carrying va
lue then it must be written down to its implied fair value. 
Due
 to a significant decrease in MGM China’s cash flows as well as a decline in the market capitalization of MGM China relative to its net book value, weperformed
 an interim impairment test of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit in the second quarter of 2015. As of the date we completed our 2015interim
 goodwill impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of our MGM China reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 9%. We therefore concluded thatgoodwill
 related to the MGM China reporting unit was not impaired. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill byreviewing
 each of our reporting units, including our MGM China reporting unit. The step one goodwill analysis of the MGM China reporting unit indicated the fairvalue
 was less than its carrying value by 4%. The decrease in fair value from the interim test valuation date resulted from a further decrease in forecasted cash flowsfrom
 our interim analysis based on current market conditions and a further sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the MGM China reporting unit aswell
 as those of the MGM China reporting unit’s peer group. As a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis, we proceeded to perform a steptwo
 impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. As  such, we determined the current fair values of all assets of the MGM China reporting unit, including itsseparately
 identifiable intangible assets. The current fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by asignificant
 amount, leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill.  Therefore,  we recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historicalcarrying value of goodwill r
elated to the MGM China reporting unit to its implied fair value. 
With
 the  exception  of  our  MGM  China  reporting  unit,  as  discussed  above,  none  of  our  other  reporting  units  incurred  any  goodwill  impairment  chargesin 2015, 2014 or 2013. As of the date we complet
ed our 2015 goodwill impairment analysis, the estimated fair values of our wholly owned domestic resorts reportingunits
 with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values.  As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates aspart
 of these analyses. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units toexceed their fair v
alues in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. 
There
 are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment.  In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective andactual
 results may differ materially from our estimates.  In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairmenttests are highly judgment
al and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions. 
See
 Notes 7 and 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of write downs and impairments of goodwill and long-livedassets.
 
Impairment
of
Investments
in
Unconsolidat
ed
Affiliates 
We
 evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of ourinvestment may have expe
rienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. If such conditions exist, we 
49

 compare
 the estimated fair value of  the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment isother-than-temporary
 based on our assessment of relevant factors, including consideration of our intent and ability to retain o ur  investment. We estimate fair valueusing a discounted cash flow analysis ba
sed on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates, as well asa
 market approach that utilizes business enterpri se  value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group.  See Note 6 and Note 15 to the accompanyingconsolidated financia
l statements for discussion of other-than-temporary impairment charges. 
Income
Taxes
 
We
 recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences witha
 future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not.  Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. As of December 31, 2015, thescheduled
 future reversal of existing U.S. federal taxable temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing U.S. federal deductible temporarydifferences.
  Consequently, we no longer apply a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets other than our foreign tax credit deferred tax assetand a capital loss car
ryforward. 
As
 of December 31, 2015, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $2.9 billion against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.7 billion basedupon
 our assessment of future realization.  The foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue inMacau.
  Because  MGM  China  is  presently  exempt  from  the  Macau  12%  complementary  tax  on  gaming  profits,  we  believe  that  payment  of  the  Macau  SpecialGaming
 Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes. Although MGM China’s current five-year exemption from theMacau
 12% complementary tax on gaming profits ends on December 31, 2016, we believe it will be entitled to receive a third five-year exemption from Macaubased
 upon exemptions granted to its competitors in order to ensure non-discriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires.  For allperiods
 beyond December 31, 2021, we have assumed that MGM China will be paying the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not beable to
 credit the Macau Special Gaming Tax in such years and have factored that assumption into our assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferredtax
 asset.  Furthermore, we do not rely on future U.S. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to our history of recent losses inthe U.S. and therefore only rely on U.S. fed
eral taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period. 
Our
 assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability ofand
 distributions from MGM China, our assumption concerning renewals of the five year exemption from Macau’s 12% complementary tax on gaming profits andassumptions
 concerning future U.S. operating profits.  As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance andchanges
 to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance.  For example, should we in a future period actually receive or beable
 to assume an additional five year exemption, an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax creditdeferred
 tax asset, resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material.  In addition, a change to our forecastsof
 future profitability of and distributions from MGM China could also result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on theprovision for income taxes 
in such period.   
Finally,
 we  do  not  currently  rely  on  future  U.S.  source  operating  income  in  assessing  future  foreign  tax  credit  realization  due  to  our  recent  history  ofcumulative
 losses in the U.S. and therefore only rely on U.S. federal taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10-year foreign tax creditcarryover
 period. However, due to improvements in our U.S. operations we have generated U.S. operating profits for the past four consecutive quarters.  Shouldthese
 profits continue in future periods, we may during the next 12 months begin to utilize projections of future U.S. source operating income in our assessment ofthe
 realizability  of  our  foreign  tax  credit  deferred  tax  asset,  which  could  result  in  a  reduction  in  the  valuation  allowance  and  a  corresponding  reduction  in  theprovision
 for income taxes in such period.  However, the exact timing and amount of reduction in the valuation allowance are subject to change on the basis of thelevel of profitability that 
we are able to actually achieve. 
In
 addition, there is an $18 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $3 millionon a
 federal income tax capital loss carryforward, a valuation allowance of $69 million on certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $1 millionon Hong Kong net operating losses because we be
lieve these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition. 
We
 file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid inforeign jurisdictions are not material.  Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue 
Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities.  Positionstaken
 in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities.  See Note 10 in theaccompanying consolidated 
financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities. 
50

  
We
 assess our tax positions using a two-step process.  A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold, and is measured at thelargest
 amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized.  Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date.  Liabilitieswe
 record  as  a  result  of  this  analysis  are  recorded  separately  from  any  current  or deferred  income  tax accounts,  and  are  classified  as  current  in “Other  accruedliabilities”
 or long-term in “Other long-term liabilities” based on the time until expected payment.  Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any,related to unrecogniz
ed tax benefits in income tax expense. 
During
 the fourth quarter of 2015, we early adopted on a prospective basis FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, “Balance sheet Classificationof Deferred
 Taxes,” (“ASU 2015-17”), which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  ASU 2015-17requires
 that deferred tax liabilities and assets, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. Prior to adopting
 ASU 2015-17, we had a current deferred tax liability of $62 million for the period ending December 31, 2014.  Prior periods are not retrospectivelyadjusted in the accompan
ying financial statements.Stock-based
Compensation
 
We
 account  for  stock  options  and  stock  appreciation  rights  (“SARs”)  measuring  fair  value  using  the  Black-Scholes  model.  For  restricted  share  units(“RSUs”),
 compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.  We account for performance stock units (“PSUs”)measuring
 fair value using the Monte Carlo valuation model. There are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the Black-Scholesmodel
 and Monte Carlo valuation model.  Our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model can significantly affect the fair value ofstock
 options and SARs. The Monte Carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions, including volatility, to determine the fair value of the award. Changesin the
 subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of share-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in theconsolidated financia
l statements.  The extent of the impact will depend, in part, on the extent of awards in any given year. 
Market
Risk
 
In
 addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks.  Market risk is the risk of loss arisingfrom
 adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate riskassociated
 with our variable rate long-term debt.  We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowingsand
 short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow forfixed-rate debt instruments.
 As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may beaffected
 by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures.  We do not hold or issue financialinstruments for trading pu
rposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions. 
As
 of December 31, 2015, long-term variable rate borrowings represented approximately 33% of our total borrowings.  Assuming a 100 basis-point increasein
 LIBOR (in the case of term loan B, over the 1% floor specified in our senior credit facility), our annual interest cost would change by approximately $27 millionbased
 on gross amounts outstanding at December 31, 2015. Assuming a 100 basis-point increase in HIBOR for the MGM China credit facility, our annual interestcost
 would change by approximately $16 million based on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2015. The following table provides additional information aboutour gross long-term debt subje

In addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also expose
d to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainlyrelated
 to  MGM  China  and  to  our  operations  at  MGM  Macau  and  the  development  of  MGM  Cotai.  While  recent  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  have  not  beensignificant,
 potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability inthese exchange rates. W
e cannot assure 
51

 you
 that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the c urrent  peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar will remain at the same level.  Thepossible
 changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. As of December 31, 2015, a 1% increase in theHong Kong dollar 
(the functional currency  of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by $7 million and a1% decrease in the exch
ange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $16 million.

We
 have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2015,based
 on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  —  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  TreadwayCommission.
 The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  theeffectiveness
 of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require thatwe
 plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all  materialrespects.
  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing andevaluating
 the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary inthe circumstances.  W
e believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principalfinancial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors
, management, and other personnel to provide reasonableassurance
 regarding  the  reliability  of financial  reporting  and  the preparation  of financial  statements  for external  purposes in accordance  with generally  acceptedaccounting
 principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of recordsthat,
 in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  thattransactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receiptsand
 expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonableassurance
 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on thefinancial statements.
 
Because
 of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override ofcontrols,
 material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness ofthe internal control
 over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
 our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on thecriteria establ
ished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We
 have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  consolidated  financialstatements
 and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Our report dated February 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinionon those financial stat
ements and financial statement schedule.

We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2015and
 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in theperiod
 ended December 31, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2). Thesefinancial
 statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on thefinancial statements and financial
 statement schedule based on our audits. 
We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require thatwe
 plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,on
 a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used andsignificant
 estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basisfor our opinion.
 
In
 our  opinion,  such  consolidated  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  MGM  Resorts  International  andsubsidiaries
 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2015,
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, whenconsidered in relation to
 the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 
We
 have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal controlover
 financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal 
Control—Integrated

BASIS
OF

PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 
Principles
of
consolidation.
  The consolidated financi al statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company’s investments inunconsolidated
 affiliates which are 50% or less owned are accounted for under the equity method.  The Company does not have significant variable interests invariable interest entities. All
 intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Management’s
use

of
estimates.
  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted inthe
 United States of America.  These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assetsand
 liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during thereporting period.  Actual r
esults could differ from those estimates. 
Fair

value
measurements.
  Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments inunconsolidated
 affiliates, cost method investments, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair valuemeasurements
 also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sellan
 asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy thatincludes:
 Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which areunobservable inputs.
 
 
· The Company uses Level 1 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 9; 
· The Company used Level 3 inputs when assessing th e fair value of its investment in Grand Victoria. See Note 6; and 
· The Company used Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when measuring the impairment of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit, See Note 7. 
Cash
and
cash
equivalents.
  Cash and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date ofacquisition.
  Such investments  are carried  at cost, which approximates  market  value.  Book overdraft  balances  resulting  from the Company’s cash managementprogram are recorded as acco
unts payable, construction payable, or other accrued liabilities, as applicable. 
Cash

deposits
–
original
maturities
longer
than
90
days.
At  December 31, 2014, the Company had $570 million in certificates of deposit with originalmaturities longer th
an 90 days. Scheduled maturities were at or prior to March 31, 2015. The fair value of the certificates of deposit equaled their carrying value. 
Accounts
receivable
and
credit
risk.
  Financial  instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casinoaccounts
 receivable.   The  Company  issues  credit  to  approved  casino  customers  and  gaming  promoters  following  background  checks  and  investigations  ofcreditworthiness.
  At December 31, 2015, 63% of the Company’s casino receivables were due from customers residing in foreign countries.  Business or economicconditions or other 
significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables. 
Accounts receivable
 are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost.  Accounts are written off when management deems the account to beuncollectible.
  Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received.  An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce theCompany’s
 receivables  to  their  net  carrying  amount,  which  approximates  fair  value.   The  allowance  is  estimated  based  on  both  a  specific  review  of  customeraccounts as well as histori
cal collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2015, no significantconcentrations of cred
it risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded. 
 
73

 Inventories.
  Inventories  consist  primarily  of  food  and  beverage,  retail  merchandise  and  operating  supplies,  and  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  ormarket. 
 Cost is determi ned  primarily using the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies.  Cost for retail merchandise is determined usingthe cost method.
 
Property
and
equipment.


Property and equipment are s tated at cost.  A significant amount of the Company’s property and equipment was acquired throughbusiness
 combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.  Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in thedetermination
 of income or loss.  Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had accrued $17 million and $14million
 for property and equipment within accounts payable and $44 million and $24 million related to construction retention accrued in other long-term liabilities,respectively.
 
Property and equipment are g
enerally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis: 
Buildings and improvements
 20 to 40 years Land improvements
 10 to 20 years Furniture and fixtures
 3 to 20 years Equipment
 3 to 20 years  
The
 Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held andused.  Several criteri
a must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell theasset
 at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower ofcarrying value
 or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model.  For assets to beheld
 and used, the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of theasset,
 on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset.  If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated.  If theundiscounted cash
 flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discountedcash flow model.  If an asset 
is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.  All recognized impairment losses, whether for assetsheld for sale or assets to b
e held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.  See Note 15 for information on recorded impairment charges. 
Capitalized

interest.
The  interest  cost  associated  with  major  development  and  construction  projects  is  capitalized  and  included  in  the  cost  of  theproject.
  When  no  debt  is  incurred  specifically  for  a  project,  interest  is  capitalized  on  amounts  expended  on  the  project  using  the  weighted-average  cost  of  theCompany’s outstanding borrowings.  Capital
ization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than abrief period.
 
Investments

in
and
advances
to
unconsolidated
affiliates.
The  Company  has  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted  for  under  the  equitymethod. Under
 the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses, amortization of certain basis differences,as
 well as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of investmentand
 recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and losses as well asgains
 and impairments related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of operating income or loss, as the Company’s investments in suchunconsolidated affili
ates are an extension of the Company’s core business operations. 
The
 Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carryingvalue of its investment may have experienced an “other-than-temporary” decline in value. If such conditio
ns exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value ofthe
 investment  to  its  carrying  value  to  determine  if  an  impairment  is  indicated  and  determines  whether  the  impairment  is  “other-than-temporary”  based  on  itsassessment
 of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using adiscounted cash flow
 analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach thatutilizes
 business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group.  See Note 6 for results of the Company’s review of itsinvestment in certain of its
 unconsolidated affiliates.
Goodwill

and
other
intangible
assets.
  Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  fair  market  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  businesscombinations.
  Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  must  be  reviewed  for  impairment  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certaincircumstances.
 The Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.  An impairment of goodwill related to the MGM Chinareporting unit was recorded 
as a result of the annual impairment review in 2015. No impairments were indicated or recorded in 2014 and 2013.  See Note 7. 
 
74

 Goodwill
 for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted  cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the Company’sreporting
 units  discounted  using  market  discount  rates  and  market  indicators  of  terminal  year  capitalization  rates,  and  a  market  approach  that  utilizes  businessenterprise 
value  multiples  based  on  a  range  of  multiples  from  the  Company’s  peer  group.   If  the  carrying  value  of  the  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value,  anindication
 of impairment exists and the Company must proceed to measure an impairment loss, if any.  To me asure  an impairment loss, the implied fair value of areporting
 unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of thereporting
 unit to its assets and liabi lities  and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill.  If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than itscarrying value
 then it must be written down to its implied fair value. License rights are tested for impairment using a discounted cash  flow approach, and trademarksare tested for impairment
 using the relief-from-royalty method.  If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairmentloss is recognized equal to 
the differe nce.  
Revenue

recognition
and
promotional
allowances.
  Casino  revenue  is  the  aggregate  net  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses,  with  liabilitiesrecognized
 for  funds  deposited  by  customers  before  gaming  play  occurs  (“casino  front  money”)  and  for  chips  in  the  customers’  possession  (“outstanding  chipliability”).
 Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and goods are provided.  Advancedeposits on rooms and advance ti
cket sales are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the customer. 
Gaming
 revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives, including discounts and points earned in point-loyalty programs.  The retail value of hotelrooms,
 food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances.  Theestimated cost of provid
ing promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

 junket operators. These operators introduce high-end gaming players to MGM Macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gamingcredit
 to these players. VIP gaming at MGM Macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase thesenonnegotiable
 chips from MGM Macau and in turn sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow MGM Macau to track the amount of wageringconducted
 by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play volume, or rolling chip turnover, which is the amount of nonnegotiable chipswagered
 and  lost.  In  exchange  for  the  gaming  promoters’  services,  MGM  Macau  compensates  the  gaming  promoters  through  revenue-sharing  arrangements  orrolling
 chip turnover-based commissions. The estimated portion of the gaming promoter commissions that represent amounts passed through to VIP customers isrecorded as a reduction o
f casino revenue, and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense. 
Reimbursed

expenses.
  The  Company  recognizes  costs  reimbursed  pursuant  to  management  services  as  revenue  in  the  period  it  incurs  thecosts.  Reimbursed costs rela
ted primarily to the Company’s management of CityCenter. 
Loyalty
programs.


The Company’s primary  loyalty program is “M life” and is available to patrons at substantially all of the Company’s wholly owned andoperated
 resorts and CityCenter. Members may earn points and/or Express Comps for their gaming play which can be redeemed at restaurants, box offices or the Mlife
 front desk at participating properties.  Points may also be redeemed for free slot play on participating machines. The Company records a liability based on thepoints
 earned multiplied by the redemption value, less an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed, and records a corresponding reduction in casino revenue.Customers
 also earn Express Comps based on their gaming play which can be redeemed for complimentary goods and services, including hotel rooms, food andbeverage,
 and entertainment.  The Company records a liability for the estimated costs of providing goods and services for Express Comps based on the ExpressComps
 earned multiplied by a cost margin, less an estimate for Express Comps not expected to be redeemed and records a corresponding expense in the casinodepartment.
 MGM Macau also has a loyalty program, whereby patrons earn rewards that can be redeemed for complimentary services, including hotel rooms, foodand beverage, and entert
ainment.

Redeemable

noncontrolling
interest.


In  April 2015, MGM National Harbor issued non-voting economic interests in MGM National Harbor (“Interests”)to
 Radio  One,  Inc.  (“Radio  One”),  a  noncontrolling  interest  party,  for  a  purchase  price  of  $5  million.  In  addition,  Radio  One  was  given  the  right  to  make  oneadditional
 capital contribution of up to $35 million prior to July 1, 2016 for the purchase of additional Interests.  In December 2015, MGM National Harbor issuedInterests
 to 42 Gaming N.H., LLC (“42 Gaming”), a noncontrolling interest party, for a purchase price of $1.25 million. In addition, 42 Gaming was given the rightto make one additional c
apital contribution of up to $8.75 million prior to July 1, 2016 for the purchase of additional Interests. 
The
 Interests provide for annual preferred distributions by MGM National Harbor to Radio One and 42 Gaming based on a percentage of its annual netgaming
 revenue (as defined in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions will begin within ninety days after the end of the fiscal year inwhich the
 opening date of MGM National Harbor occurs, and after the end of each subsequent fiscal year. Also, beginning on the third anniversary of the last day ofthe
 calendar quarter in which the opening date of MGM National Harbor occurs (and on each subsequent anniversary thereof) Radio One and 42 Gaming will eachhave
 the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portion of their Interests for a purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula.Radio
 One and 42 Gaming also each have the right to sell back all or a portion of their Interests prior to such date if MGM National Harbor were to guarantee orgrant liens to secure any 
indebtedness of the Company or its affiliates other than the indebtedness of MGM National Harbor. 
The
 Company  has  recorded  the  Interests  as  “Redeemable  noncontrolling  interests”  in  the  mezzanine  section  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  balancesheets
 and  not  stockholders’  equity  because  their  redemption  is  not  exclusively  in  the  Company’s  control.  Interests  are  initially  accounted  for  at  fair  value.Subsequently,
 the Company will recognize changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling intereststo
 equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company willreflect any changes c
aused by such an adjustment in retained earnings or accumulated deficit.

Recently

issued
accounting
standards.
On  February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards UpdateNo.
 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” (“ASU 2016-02”), which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standard Codification 840, Leases. ASU 2016-02 iseffective
 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accountingunder
 which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing aright-of-use (“ROU”)
 asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset andfor
 operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance willhave on its consolidated fin
ancial statements and footnote disclosures. 
In
 August  2015,  the  FASB  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  No.  2015-14,  “Revenue  From  Contracts  With  Customers  (Topic  606):  Deferral  of  theEffective Date,”
 which defers the effective date of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers,” (“ASU 2014-09”) to thefiscal
 year, and interim periods within the year, beginning on or after December 15, 2017. FASB ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model forentities to use in accoun
ting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specificguidance.
 This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. Additionally, the new model willrequire
 revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects toreceive in
 exchange for those goods or services. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financialstatements and footnote d
isclosures. 
In
 July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,” (“ASU 2015-11”), effective forfiscal
 years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2015-11 requires inventory that is measured using first-in,first-out
 (FIFO) or average cost method to be measured “at the lower of cost and net realizable value,” thereby simplifying the current guidance under which anentity
 must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures). ASU No. 2015-11 will not applyto
 inventories that are measured by using either the LIFO method or the retail inventory method. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption ofASU 2015-11 will have on its consolidated fin
ancial statements and footnote disclosures. 
In
 February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, “Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,” (“ASU 2015-02”), which iseffective
 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. ASU 2015-02 amends: the assessment of whether a limitedpartnership
 is a variable interest entity; the effect that fees paid to a decision maker have on the consolidation analysis; how variable interests held by a reportingentity’s
 related parties or de facto agents affect its consolidation conclusion; and for entities other than limited partnerships, clarifies how to determine whether theequity holders as a
 
77

 gr 
oup have power over an entity. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and footnotedisclosures.
 
During
 2015, the Company early adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” (“ASU 2015-03”),
 which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistentwith
 the presentation of a debt discount. The amortization of such costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. In  addition, in accordance with ASU No.2015-15,
 “Presentation  and  Subsequent  Measurement  of  Debt  Issuance  Costs  Associated  with  Line-of-Credit  Arrangements:  Amendments  to  SEC  ParagraphPursuant
 to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting,” (“ASU 2015-15”), which was adopted concurrent with ASU 2015-03, the Company will continueto present
 the debt issuance costs associated with the Company's revolving credit facilities as other assets included within the Company's consolidated balance sheetsand
 continue amortizing those deferred costs over the term of the related facilities. ASU 2015-03 requires the new guidance to be applied on a retrospective basis.Accordingly,
 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company reclassified $118 million and $109 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs in the accompanyingconsolidated balance she
ets. 
During
 the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company early adopted on a prospective basis FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, “Balance SheetClassification
 of Deferred Taxes,” (“ASU 2015-17”).  ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets, along with any related valuation allowance, beclassified
 as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in ASU 2015-17 may be applied on either a prospective or retrospectivebasis. The
 Company had a current deferred tax liability of $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 on a prospectivebasis, and accordingly the pr
ior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted in the accompanying financial statements.

 CityCenter, the remaining Perini subcontractors and relevant insurers to resolve all outstanding project lien claims and CityCenter’scounterclaims
 relating to the Harmon Hotel and Spa. The settlement was subject to execution of a global settlement agreement among the parties described above,which
 was subsequently executed, and CityCenter’s procurement of replacement general liability insurance covering construction of the CityCenter development,which
 was obtained in January 2015. The proceeds pursuant to such global settlement agreement, combined with certain prior Harmon-related insurance settlementproceeds, resulted in a ga
in of $160 million recorded by CityCenter during the first quarter of 2015, of which the Company recorded its 50% share of $80 million. 
CityCenter

October
2013

debt
restructuring
transactions.
 In  October 2013, CityCenter entered into a $1.775 billion senior secured credit facility. The senior securedcredit facility 
consists of a $75 million revolving facility maturing in October 2018, and a $1.7 billion term 
79

 loan
 B facility maturing in October 2020. The term loan B facility was issued at 99% of the principal amount and bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% with a LIBORf 
loor of 1.00%. Concurrent with the closing of the new senior secured credit  facility,  CityCenter issued a notice of full redemption  with respect  to its existing7.625%
 senior secured first lien notes and 10.75%/11.50% senior secured second lien PIK toggle notes  and discharged each of the indentures for its first and secondlien notes
 at a premium in accordance with the terms of such indentures. As a result of the transaction, the Company recorded a charge of $70 million for its share ofCityCenter’s
 non-ope rating  loss on retirement of long-term debt, primarily consisting of premiums associated with the redemption of the existing first and secondlien
 notes as well as the write-off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs. CityCenter permanently repaid $ 38  million and $154 million of its term loan Bfacility in 2015 and 2014, respe
ctively. 
In
 addition, in connection with the October 2013 debt restructuring, sponsor notes with a carrying value of approximately $738 million were converted tomembers’
 equity.  Subsequent to these  transactions,  CityCenter’s  senior  credit  facility  is its only remaining  long-term  debt.  The senior  secured  credit  facility  issecured
 by substantially all the assets of CityCenter, and contains certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage ratios and maximum leverageratio requirements 
(as defined in the CityCenter agreements). 
Grand
Victoria
 
At December 31,
 2015, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its Grand Victoria investment for impairment due to a greater than anticipated decline inoperating
 results due in part to a continued loss of market share to video gaming terminals, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows compared to the priorforecast.
 The Company used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value from a marketparticipant’s
 viewpoint.  Key  assumptions  included  in  the  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  were  estimates  of  future  cash  flows  including  outflows  for  capitalexpenditures,
 a long-term growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.5%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business enterprisevalue multiples
 selected based on the range of multiples in Grand Victoria’s peer group. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined that it was necessary torecord
 an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $17 million at December 31, 2015, based on an estimated fair value of $123 million for the Company’s 50%interest.
 The  Company  intends  to,  and  believes  it  will  be  able  to,  retain  the  investment  in  Grand  Victoria;  however,  due  to  the  extent  of  the  shortfall  and  theCompany’s assessment of the unce
rtainty of fully recovering its investment, the Company has determined that the impairment was other-than-temporary. 
At
 June 30, 2014, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its Grand Victoria investment for impairment due to a greater than anticipated decline inoperating
 results and loss of market share due to the proliferation of video gaming terminals in the Illinois market, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flowscompared
 to the prior forecast. The Company used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fairvalue
 from a market participant’s viewpoint. Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflowsfor
 capital expenditures, a long-term growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.5%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included businessenterprise
 value multiples selected based on the range of multiples in Grand Victoria’s peer group. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined that it wasnecessary
 to record an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $29 million at June 30, 2014, based on an estimated fair value of $140 million for the Company’s50% interest.
 
At
 June 30, 2013, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its Grand Victoria investment for impairment due to a greater than anticipated decline inoperating
 results and loss of market share as a result of the opening of a new river boat casino in the Illinois market, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flowscompared
 to the prior forecast. The Company used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fairvalue
 from a market participant’s viewpoint. Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflowsfor
 capital expenditures, a long-term growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 11%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included businessenterprise
 value multiples selected based on the range of multiples in Grand Victoria’s peer group. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined that it wasnecessary to record an oth
er-than-temporary impairment charge of $37 million based on an estimated fair value of $170 million for the Company’s 50% interest.   
Las
Vegas
Arena
Company
 
In
 September 2014, a wholly owned subsidiary of Las Vegas Arena Company entered into a senior secured credit facility to finance construction of the T-Mobile
 Arena. In connection with this senior credit  facility, MGM Resorts International  and AEG each entered into a repayment guarantee  for the term loan B(which
 is subject to increases and decreases in the event of rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan A and term loan B facilities).As of December 31, 2015, the senior secure
d credit facility consisted of a $120 million term loan A and an $80 million term loan B. The senior secured credit facilitymatures
 in October 2016, with an option to extend the maturity for three years. The senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all the assets of the LasVegas
 Arena  Company,  and  contains  certain  financial  covenants  applicable  upon  opening  of  the  T-Mobile  Arena. I n  accordance  with  the  Las  Vegas  ArenaCompany’s senior secured cred
it facility, the Company and AEG contributed equal amounts 
80

 totaling
 $175 million for construction, all of which has been contributed as of December 31, 2015. See Note 11 f or  discussion of the Company’s joint and severalcompletion and repaymen

Goodwill
 related to wholly owned domestic resorts relates to the acquisition of Mirage Resorts in 2001 and the acquisition of Mandalay Resort Group in2005.   
The Company recognized goodwill resu lting from its acquisition of a controlling interest in MGM China in 2011. 
Due
 to a significant decrease in MGM China’s cash flows as well as a decline in the market capitalization of MGM China relative to its net book value, theCompany
 performed an interim impairment test of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit in the second quarter of 2015.  The results of the Company’sinterim impairm
ent test indicated the fair value of the MGM China reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 9%. 
During
 the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of its reporting units, including itsMGM
 China reporting unit. The step one goodwill analysis of the MGM China reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%.  Thedecrease in fair value from the
 interim test valuation date resulted from a 
83

 further
 decrease in forecasted cash flows from the interim analysis based on current market conditions and a further and sus tained  decline in the enterprise valuemultiples of the MGM China repor
ting unit as well as the multiples of the reporting unit’s peer group. 
As a
 result of the indication of impairment from its step one analysis, the Company performed a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss.As
 such, the Company determined the current fair values of all assets of the MGM China reporting unit, including its separately identifiable intangible assets. Thecurrent
 fair  values  of  each  of  the  separately  identifiable  intangible  assets  exceeded  their  respective  carrying  values  by  a  significant  amount,  leading  to  a  lowerimplied
 fair  value  of  goodwill.  Therefore,  the  Company  recorded  a  $1.5  billion  non-cash  impairment  charge  to  reduce  the  historical  carrying  value  of  goodwillrelated
 to  the  MGM  China  reporting  unit  to  its  implied  fair  value.  The  impairment  charge  is  reflected  in  “Property  transactions,  net”  in  the  accompanyingConsolidated
 Statements  of  Operations  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2015.  The  carrying  value  of  goodwill  related  to  the  MGM  China  reporting  unit  as  ofDecember 31, 2015 following the imp
airment charge was $1.4 billion. 
The
 Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of development rights in Detroit, trademarks and license rights, of which $210 millionconsists of trademarks and 
trade names related to the Mandalay Resort Group acquisition. 
MGM

Grand
Paradise
gaming
subconcession.
  Pursuant to the agreement dated June 19, 2004 between MGM Grand Paradise and Sociedade de Jogos deMacau,
 S.A., a gaming subconcession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of chance and other casino games for a period of15
 years commencing on April 20, 2005. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the original terms ofthe
 agreement;  however,  management  believes  that  the  gaming  subconcession  will  be  extended,  given  that  the  land  concession  agreement  with  the  governmentextends
 significantly beyond the gaming subconcession. In addition, management believes that the fair value of MGM China reflected in the IPO pricing suggeststhat
 market  participants  have  assumed  the  gaming  subconcession  will  be  extended  beyond  its  initial  term.  As  such,  the  Company  was  amortizing  the  gamingsubconcession intangible asset
 on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the land concession through April 6, 2031.  In January 2013, the Company’s Cotai landconcession
 was gazetted by the Macau government at which time the Company determined that the estimated remaining useful life of its gaming subconcessionwould be extended through the init
ial 25-year term of the Cotai land concession, ending in January 2038.   
MGM

Maryland
license.


The Company was  granted a license to operate a casino in Maryland.  The consideration paid to the State of Maryland for the license feeof $22 million is considered 
a finite-lived intangible asset that will be amortized over a period of 15 years beginning upon the opening of the casino resort.   
Massachusetts
license.



The  Company was granted a license to operate a casino in Massachusetts.  The consideration paid to the State of Massachusetts forthe
 license fee of $85 million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that will be amortized over a period of 15 years beginning upon the opening of the casinoresort.

Income
 generated  from  gaming  operations  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  which  is  wholly  owned  by  MGM  China,  is  exempted  from  Macau’s  12%complementary tax
 for the five-year period ending December 31, 2016, pursuant to approval from the Macau government in 2011.  Absent this exemption, “Net lossattributable
 to MGM Resorts International” would have increased by $25 million and $47 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and net loss per share (diluted)would have
 increased by $0.04 and $0.10 for 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The approval granted in 2011 represented the second five-year exemption period grantedto
 MGM Grand Paradise.  The Company measures the net deferred tax liability of MGM Grand Paradise under the assumption that it will receive an additional five-year
 exemption  beyond  2016.   Such  assumption  is  based  upon  the  granting  of  a  third  five-year  exemption  to  competitors  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise.   While  noassurance
 can be given, the Company believes MGM Grand Paradise should also be entitled to a third five-year exemption in order to ensure non-discriminatorytreatment among gaming concessionaires and subconce
ssionaires, a requirement under Macanese law.  The net deferred tax liability of MGM Grand Paradise was re-measured during
 the first quarter of 2013 due to the extension of the amortization period of the Macau gaming subconcession in connection with the effectiveness ofthe
 Cotai land concession.  This resulted in an increase in the net deferred tax liability and a corresponding increase in provision for income taxes of $65 million in2013.
 
Non-gaming
 operations  remain  subject  to  the  Macau  complementary  tax.   MGM  Grand  Paradise  had  at  December  31,  2015  a  complementary  tax  netoperating
 loss carryforward of $571 million resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized against non-gaming income in years 2016 through2018.
 
MGM
 Grand Paradise’s exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits toMGM China.  However, MGM Grand Paradise has entered in
to an agreement with the Macau 
90

 government to
 settle the 12% complementary tax that would otherwise be due by its shareholder, MGM China, on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual
 payment  (“annual  fee  arrangement”)  regardless  of  the  amount  of  distributable  dividends.   Such  annual  fee  arrangement  is  effective  until  December  31,2016.
 MGM China is not subject to the complementary tax on distributions it receives during  the covered period as a result of the annual fee arrangement. Annualpayments
 of $ 2 million  are  required  under  the  annual  fee  arrangement.   The  $ 2 million  annual  payment  for  2015  and  2014  was  accrued  and  a  correspondingprovision for income taxes wa 
s recorded in each year.  
The
 Company repatriated $304 million and $390 million of foreign earnings and profits in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  At December 31, 2015, there areapproximately
 $178  million  of  unrepatriated  foreign  earnings  and  profits,  all  of  which  the  Company  anticipates  will  be  repatriated  without  the  incurrence  ofadditional
 U.S.  income  tax  expense.   Accordingly,  no  deferred  tax  liability  has  been  recorded  for  those  earnings.   Creditable  foreign  taxes  associated  with  therepatriated earnings and profits increased the Company’s forei
gn tax credit carryover by $318 million and $782 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Such foreigntaxes
 consist of the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which the Company believes qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. incometaxes.
  The foreign tax credit carryovers expire as follows: $785 million in 2022; $976 million in 2023; $782 million in 2024; and $318 million in 2025. The foreigntax credit carryove
rs are subject to valuation allowance as described further below. 
The Company has an alternativ
e minimum tax credit carryforward of $23 million that will not expire. 
For
 state income tax purposes, the Company has Illinois and New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards of $82 million and $207 million, respectively,which
 equates to deferred tax assets after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance, of $4 million and $12 million, respectively.  The Illinois net operatingloss
 carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2021 through 2026.  The New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2029 through2035.
 
As
 of  December  31,  2015,  the  scheduled  future  reversal  of  existing  U.S.  federal  taxable  temporary  differences  exceeds  the  scheduled  future  reversal  ofexisting
 U.S. federal deductible temporary differences. Consequently, the Company no longer applies a valuation allowance against its U.S. federal deferred taxassets other than
 the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and a capital loss carryforward. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $2.7 billion against the$2.9
 billion foreign tax credit deferred tax asset at December 31, 2015.  In addition, there is an $18 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided oncertain
 state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $3 million on a federal income tax capital loss carryforward, a valuation allowance of $69 million oncertain Macau deferred tax assets, and a
 valuation allowance of $1 million on Hong Kong net operating losses because we believe these assets do not meet the “morelikely than not” crit
eria for recognition. 
The foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax which is 35% of gross gami
ng revenue in Macau.  Because MGM Grand Paradise ispresently
 exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as atax
 paid  in  lieu  of  an  income  tax  that  is  creditable  against  U.S.  taxes.  Although  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  current  five-year  exemption  from  the  Macau  12%complementary
 tax  on  gaming  profits  ends  on  December  31,  2016,  the  Company  assumes  that  it  will  receive  an  additional  five-year  exemption  beyond  2016consistent
 with the assumption utilized for measurement of the net deferred tax liability of MGM Grand Paradise.  For all periods beyond December 31, 2021, theCompany has
 assumed that MGM Grand Paradise will be paying the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the MacauSpecial Gaming Tax in such years, 
and has factored that assumption into its assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset.   
Furthermore,
 the Company does not currently rely on future U.S. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to its recenthistory
 of cumulative losses in the U.S. and therefore only relies on U.S. federal taxable temporary differences that it expects will reverse during the 10-year foreigntax
 credit carryover period. However, due to improvements in its U.S. operations the Company has generated U.S. operating profits for the past four consecutivequarters.
  Should these profits continue in future periods, the Company may during the next 12 months begin to utilize projections of future U.S. source operatingincome
 in  its  assessment  of  the  realizability  of  its  foreign  tax  credit  deferred  tax  asset,  which  could  result  in  a  reduction  in  the  valuation  allowance  and  acorresponding reduction
 in the provision for income taxes in such period.  However, the exact timing and amount of reduction in the valuation allowance are subjectto change on the basis of the l
evel of profitability that the Company is able to actually achieve.

The
 total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $8 million and $12 million  at December 31, 2015and 2014, respectively.
 
The
 Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.  The Company accrued $4 million ininterest related
 to unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014.  There were no amounts accrued for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,2015. 
 No amounts were accrued for penalties as of either date.  Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes interest benefitrelated to unrecogniz
ed tax benefits as follows: $4 million benefit in 2015, $13 million benefit in 2014 and $12 million benefit in 2013. 
The
 Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the incometaxes
 paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company is no longer subject to examination of its U.S. consolidated federalincome tax returns filed for years
 ended prior to 2010.  During 2015, the Company received final approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation of the results of theIRS
 examination of the 2009 tax year and agreed to all IRS adjustments to the 2010 and 2011 tax years of CityCenter Holdings, LLC, an unconsolidated affiliatetreated
 as a partnership for income tax purposes. The Company received a refund of $16 million of taxes and associated interest in connection with the settlement ofthese
 examinations,  which  are  now  considered  settled  for  financial  accounting  purposes.  During  2014,  the  Company  received  final  approval  from  the  JointCommittee
 on Taxation of the results of the IRS examination of its consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through 2009 tax years; the 2007 through2008
 tax years of CityCenter Holdings, LLC; the 2008 through 2009 tax years of MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, a subsidiary treated as a partnership for income taxpurposes;
 and the 2005 through 2009 tax years  of Marina  District  Development  Holding Company, LLC an unconsolidated  affiliate  treated  as a partnership  forincome
 tax purposes. These examinations are now considered settled for financial reporting purposes.  The Company previously deposited $30 million with the IRSto cover the expected c
ash taxes and interest resulting from the tentatively agreed adjustments for these examinations. 
As
 of  December  31,  2015,  other  than  adjustments  resulting  from  the  federal  income  tax  audits  discussed  above,  the  Company  was  no  longer  subject  toexamination
 of its various state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2011. During 2015, the state of New Jersey completed its examination of MarinaDistrict Development
 Holding Company, LLC for the 2003 through 2009 tax years. All adjustments were agreed to by the members of Marina District DevelopmentHolding
 Company, LLC and the examination is now considered settled for financial accounting purposes.  The Company made a $1 million payment of tax andassociated interest as a res
ult of this settlement.  No other state or local income tax returns are currently under examination. 
The
 Company does not anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 will change materially within the next twelvemonths.

 for operating leases was $74 million, $65 million and $41 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Amounts included short term rentals charged torent expense.  Rental expense 
includes $7 million related to the Cotai land concession for 2015, 2014 and 2013. The Company accounts for the Cotai land concessioncontract
 as  an  operating  lease  for  which  the  required  upfront  payments  are  amortized  over  the  initial  25-year  contract  term.  Rent  recognized  for  the  Cotai  landconcession is included in “Preop
ening and start-up expenses” prior to opening. 
In
 April 2013, the Company entered into a ground lease agreement for an approximate 23 acre parcel of land in connection with the MGM National Harborproject.
 The ground lease has an initial term of 25 years and the right to extend for up to 13 additional six year periods with the first 7 of those additional periodsconsidered to
 be reasonably assured. The Company therefore amortizes the lease on a straight line basis over a 67 year term. The ground lease  is accounted for as anoperating
 lease with rental expense of $19 million and $13 million recorded for  the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Rent  recognized for theground lease is included in "Preop

Cotai

land
concession
contract.
  MGM Grand Paradise’s land concession contract for an approximate 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip in Macau becameeffective
 on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years. The total land premium payable to the Macau government for the land concession contract is $161million
 and is  composed  of a down payment  and eight  additional  semi-annual  payments.  As of December  31, 2015,  MGM China had paid $130  million  of thecontract
 premium, including interest due on the semi-annual installments, and the amount paid is recorded within “Other long-term assets, net.” In  January 2016,MGM
 China  paid  the  sixth  semi-annual  installment  of  $15  million  under  the  land  concession  contract.   Including  interest  on  the  two  remaining  semi-annualinstallments, MGM China has approxi
mately $29 million remaining payable for the land concession contract. Under the terms of the land concession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is required to bu
ild and open MGM Cotai by January 2018. 
CityCenter
completion
guarantee.
  In October 2013, the Company entered into a third amended and restated completion and cost overrun guarantee, which was
 collateralized by substantially all of the assets of Circus Circus Las Vegas, as well as certain land adjacent to that property. During the first quarter of 2015, theCompany
 fulfilled  its  remaining  significant  obligations  under  the  completion  guarantee  in  conjunction  with  the  resolution  of  the  Perini  litigation  and  relatedsettlement
 agreements. In total, the Company funded $888 million under the completion guarantee. In June 2015, the completion guarantee was terminated and thecollateral assets s
ecuring such completion guarantee were released. 
T-Mobile

Arena.
In  conjunction with the Las Vegas Arena Company entering a senior secured credit facility in 2014, the Company and AEG each enteredjoint
 and several completion guarantees for the project, as well as a repayment guarantee for term loan B (which is subject to increases and decreases in the event ofa
 rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan A and term loan B facilities). As of December 31, 2015, term loan A was $120 millionand term loan B was $80 million.  
 
Other
guarantees.
  The Company is party to various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of creditissued
 by financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to $500 million, and the amount ofavailable borrowings under the
 senior credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $26 million in letters ofcredit outstanding.   
MGM China’s  
93

 senior
 credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to $100 million, and the amount of available borrowings under the senior credit facility is reduced by any outstanding let
ters of credit.   At December 31, 2015 MGM China had provided approximately $39 million of guarantees under its credit facility. 
Other
litigation.
  The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business.  Management doesnot believe that the out

The  Company’s  omnibus  incentive  plan,  as  amended  (the  “Omnibus  Plan”),  allows  it  to  grant  stock  options,  stockappreciation
 rights (“SARs”), restricted  stock units (“RSUs”), performance  share  units (“PSUs”) and other  stock-based  awards to eligible  directors,  officers  andemployees
 of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Omnibus Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors.The
 Committee  has  discretion  under  the  Omnibus  Plan  regarding  which  type  of  awards  to  grant,  the  vesting  and  service  requirements,  exercise  price  and  otherconditions, in all cases subj
ect to certain limits, including: 
 
· As amended, the Omnibus Plan allows for th e issuance of up to 45 million shares or share-based awards; and 
· For  stock options and SARs, the exercise price of the award must be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and themaximum term of such an 
award is 10 years. 
SARs
 granted under the Omnibus Plan generally have terms of seven years, and in most cases vest in four equal annual installments. RSUs granted vestratably
 over four years, a portion of which are subject to achievement of a performance target based on operational results compared to budget in order for suchRSUs
 to be eligible to vest. Expense is recognized primarily on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards net of estimated forfeitures. Estimatedforfeitures are updated perio
dically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate. 
PSUs
 granted vest subject to a market condition, in which a percentage of the target award granted vests based on the performance of the Company’s stockprice
 in relation to the target price at the end of a three year performance period.  Specifically, the ending average stock price must equal the target price, which isdefined as 125% of the beginning average stoc
k price, in order for the target award to vest.  No shares are issued unless the ending average stock price is at least 60%of the
 target price, and the maximum payout is capped at 160% of the target award.  If the ending average stock price is at least 60% or more of the target price, thenthe
 amount of units granted in the target award is multiplied by the stock performance multiplier.  The stock performance multiplier equals the ending average stockprice
 divided by the target price.  For this purpose, the target and ending prices are based on the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over the 60calendar
 day periods ending on the grant date and the third anniversary of the grant date.  Expense is recognized on a graded basis over the performance periodbeginning on the 
date of grant. Estimated forfeitures are updated periodically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate.

BENEFIT
PLANS 
Multiemployer

benefit
plans.
  Employees of the Company who are members of various unions are covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained,multiemployer
 health and welfare and defined benefit pension plans.  Of these plans, the Company considers the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders PensionPlan
 (the “Pension Plan”), under the terms of collective bargaining agreements with the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas for and on behalf of CulinaryWorkers
 Union Local No. 226 and Bartenders Union Local No. 165, to be individually significant. The risk of participating in the Pension Plan differs from single-employer plans in the fol
lowing aspects: 
 
a) Assets contributed to the mul tiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; 
b) If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; 
c) If  an entity chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the entity may be required to pay those plans an amount based on theunderfunded status of the plan, 
referred to as a withdrawal liability; 
d) If  the Pension Plan is terminated by withdrawal of all employers and if the value of the nonforfeitable benefits exceeds plan assets and withdrawalliability payments, e
mployers are required by law to make up the insufficient difference. 
Pursuant
 to  its  collective  bargaining  agreements  referenced  above,  the  Company  also  contributes  to  UNITE  HERE  Health  (the  “Health  Fund”),  whichprovides healthcare ben
efits to its active and retired members. The Company’s participation in the Pension Plan is outlined in the table below.

 Casino, LLC, Bellagio, Mandalay Corp., MGM Grand Hotel, LLC and the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas are the most significantbecause more than half o

 During
 2014 an  amendment to the collective bargaining agreements to temporarily divert contributions from the Pension Plan to the Health Fund was ineffect. As a result cont
ributions to the Pension Plan decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 and incre ased in 2015 compared to 2014 as the amendment ended in June of2014.
 Hours worked in 2015 increased approximately 1% compared to 2014. Bellagio, Aria, Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas were listed in the PensionPlan’ 
s  Forms 5500 as providing more than 5% of the total contributions for the plan years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. At the date the financial statementswere issued, Form 5500 was not availabl
e for the plan year ending in 2015. No surcharges were impose d on the Company’s contributions to any o f the plans. 
Self-insurance.
  The Company is self-insured for most health care benefits and workers compensation for its non-union employees. The liability for healthcare
 claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported was $22 million and $20 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The workerscompensation
 liability  for  claims  filed  and  estimates  of  claims  incurred  but  not  reported  was  $43  million  and  $48  million  as  of  December  31,  2015  and  2014,respectively. Both liabilitie

SEGMENT
INFORMATION
 
The
 Company’s management views each of its casino resorts as an operating segment.  Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economiccharacteristics,
 types of customers, types of services and products provided, the regulatory environments in which they operate, and their management and reportingstructure.
  The Company’s principal operating activities occur in two geographic regions: the United States and Macau S.A.R.  The Company has aggregated itsoperations
 into  two  reportable  segments  based  on  the  similar  characteristics  of  the  operating  segments  within  the  regions  in  which  they  operate:  wholly  owneddomestic
 resorts and MGM China. The Company’s operations related to investments in unconsolidated affiliates, MGM Hospitality, and certain other corporate andmanagement
 operations have not been identified as separate reportable segments; therefore, these operations are included in corporate and other in the followingsegment disclosures to re
concile to consolidated results. 
The

 defined  as  Adjusted  EBITDA  before  corporate  expense  and  stock  compensation  expense  related  to  the  Omnibus  Plan,  which  are  not  allocated  to  thereportable
 segments  or  each  operating  segment,  as  applicable.  MGM  China  recognizes  stock  compensation  expense  related  to  the  MGM  China  Plan  which  isincluded
 in  the  calculation  of  Adjusted  EBITDA  for  MGM  China.  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  a  measure  defined  as  earnings  before  interest  and  other  non-operatingincome (expense), taxes, d
epreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net.

 For the purposes of this Section 3.5(b), (1)
 “Base Profit Interest” shall mean, with respect to a Member, the percentage equivalent of a fraction, the numeratorof
 which shall be the aggregate Capital Contributions made to the Company by such Member pursuant to this Agreement, and the denominator of which shall be theaggregate
 Capital Contributions made to the Company by all the Members pursuant to this Agreement, (2) “Individual Adjusted Profit Interest Addition” shall meanthe
 product  of  (i)  0.5  and  (ii)  the  difference  between  (A)  the  Base  Profit  Interest  of  such  Member  immediately  after  the  corresponding  Additional  CapitalContribution
 and  (B)  the  Base  Profit  Interest  of  such  Member  immediately  prior  to  such  Additional  Capital  Contribution,  (3)  “Individual  Base  Profit  InterestAddition”
 shall mean the difference between (A) the Base Profit Interest of such Member immediately after such Additional Capital Contribution and (B) the BaseProfit
 Interest  of  such  Member  immediately  prior  to  such  Additional  Capital  Contribution,  (4)  “Individual  Adjusted  Profit  Interest  Subtraction”  shall  mean  theproduct
 of (i) 0.5 and (ii) the difference between (A) the Base Profit Interest of such Member immediately prior to such Additional Capital Contribution and (B) theBase
 Profit Interest of such Member immediately after such Additional Capital Contribution, and (5) “Individual Base Profit Interest Subtraction” shall mean thedifference
 between (A) the Base Profit Interest of such Member immediately prior to such Additional Capital Contribution and (B) the Base Profit Interest of suchMember immediate
ly after such Additional Capital Contribution.By
 way of illustration, assume that (A) the Base Profit Interest and the Profit Interest of each Member is fifty percent (50%), in each case, immediately priorto
 a Additional Capital Contribution; (B) each of the Parties have made a prior Capital Contribution of $3,000,000,000; (C) the Members approve an AdditionalCapital
 Contribution pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof in the amount of $500,000,000, and (D) IW contributes only $150,000,000 (versus $250,000,000). If MGMcontributes
 the $100,000,000 shortfall by IW in addition to its own $250,000,000 pro 
rata
share  of the Capital Contribution, the resulting Profit Interest of MGMfollowing such contribution would be 52.31%, d
etermined as follows:Base Profit Interest of MGM af
ter the Additional Capital Contribution:[$3,000,000,000 
plus $350,000,000] divided by [$6,500,000,000] = 51.54% Base Profit Interest of MGM prio
r to the Additional Capital Contribution: 50%Individual Adjusted Profit Int
erest Addition of MGM as a result of the Additional Capital Contribution:(51.54%-50%) x 0.5 = 0.77%
Individual Base Profit Inte
rest Addition of MGM as a result of the Additional Capital Contribution:(51.54%-50%) = 1.54%
Profit Interest of MGM aft
er the Additional Capital Contribution:50% + 1.54% + 0.77% = 52.31%.
Accordingly, the resulting Prof
it Interest of MGM would be 52.31%.Assume
 that, following such Additional Capital Contribution, each of the Members approve a second Additional Capital Contribution pursuant toSection
 3.3 in the amount of $100,000,000, and IW fails to contribute any of such second Additional Capital Contribution. If MGM contributes the$50,000,000
 shortfall by IW in addition to its own $50,000,000 pro 
rata
share  of the second Additional Capital Contribution, the resulting ProfitInterest of MGM following such cont
ribution would be 53.41%, determined as follows:Base
 Profit Interest of MGM after the second Additional Capital Contribution: [$3,000,000,000 plus $350,000,000 plus $100,000,000]  divided by[$6,600,000,000] = 52.27%
Base

Income Tax on Residential Units . (a)
 With respect to the first “True Proceeds”, as defined below, received by the Company from closings of the sales or contracts of sale of anyresidential
 units  in  the  Project  Components,  IW’s  maximum  income  tax  liability,  as  determined  by  IW,  for  federal,  state,  and  foreign  income  tax  purposes(collectively
 the “IW Tax Liability”) with respect to any gain allocated by the Company to IW with respect to sales of residential units, in each case, within theProject Components shall be limited
 to $10 million. MGM shall make a Capital Contribution to the Company in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the IW TaxLiability
 over $10 million (the “MGM Additional Contribution”). The Company will distribute the MGM Additional Contribution to IW immediately upon IW’srequest.
 The amount of any MGM Additional Contribution shall be determined by MGM, subject to review by IW, on a quarterly basis with such amount to befunded
 in cash by MGM no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter. “True Proceeds” shall mean the amount equal to $2.673 billion less Actual Pre-Closing Residential Proceeds.
(b)
 With respect to Net Residential Proceeds received by the Company in excess of the first True Proceeds from closings of the sales of anyresidential units in th
e Project Components, each of the Members shall be responsible for its respective tax liability.(c)
 The Capital Accounts of the Members with respect to the MGM Additional Contribution shall be adjusted such that each of MGM andIW’s percentage
 of total capital of the Company immediately before the MGM Additional Contribution equals each such Member’s percentage of total capital of theCompany
 immediately after the MGM Additional Contribution and the distribution of such amount by the Company to IW (assuming for this purpose that suchamount
 is immediately distributed by the Company to IW). For example, if immediately before a MGM Additional Contribution the total capital of the Companywas $5.4
 billion and MGM and IW each shared in 50% of such total capital or $2.7 billion each, upon a $0.1 billion MGM Additional Contribution to the Company,IW’s
 and MGM’s Capital Account balance immediately after the MGM Additional Contribution would be $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Subsequently,the
 distribution of the MGM Additional Contribution in the amount of $0.1 billion to IW will reduce IW’s Capital Account balance to $2.6 billion, and thereforeallow
 IW’s and MGM’s Capital Account balance to be in the proper ratio of 50% each. In no event will this adjustment affect IW’s or MGM’s respective ProfitInterest.

DESCRIPTION
OF
REGULAT
ION
AND
LICENSING 
The gaming industry is highly regu
lated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.  Each of our casinos is subject toextensive regulation unde
r the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located.  These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern theresponsibility, financi
al stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations.  Violations of laws in onejurisdiction could resul
t in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. 
In addition to gaming regul
ations, our businesses are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations of the countries and states in which weoperate.  These laws and regul
ations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters,employment and immigr

aws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business andoperating results.

Nevada
Government
Regulation
 
The ownership and operation of our c
asino gaming facilities in Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgatedthereunder (collec
tively, the “Nevada Act”), and various local regulations.  Our gaming operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the NevadaGaming Commission (the “Nevada Comm
ission”), the Nevada State Gaming Control Board (the “Nevada Board”), and various county and city licensing agencies(the “local authori
ties”).  The Nevada Commission, the Nevada Board, and the local authorities are collectively referred to as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.” 
The laws, regulations, and superviso
ry procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with,among other things:
 
 
·the prevention of unsavory or unsui table persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; 
 
·the establishment and m aintenance of responsible accounting practices; 
 
·the maintenance of effective contr ols over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscalaffairs and the safegu
arding of assets and revenues; 
 
·providing reliable re cord keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities; 
 
·the prevention of cheat ing and fraudulent practices; and 
 
·providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees. 
Any change in the laws, regulations, 
and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities could have an adverse effect on our gaming operations. 
Each of our subsidiaries tha
t currently operate casinos in Nevada (collectively, the “Nevada casino licensees”) is required to be licensed by the Nevada GamingAuthorities.  Each gaming li
cense requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable.  MGM Grand Hotel, LLC, New York-New York Hotel &Casino, LLC, Bellagio, LLC, MGM Resorts Manufacturing Corp., and Ar
ia Resort & Casino, LLC are also licensed as manufacturers and distributors of gamingdevices (collectiv
ely, the “Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees”).  Certain of our subsidiaries have also been licensed or found suitable as shareholders,members, or general pa
rtners, as relevant, of the Nevada casino licensees and of the Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees.  The Nevada casino licensees,Nevada manufacturer and d
istributor licensees, and the foregoing subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Nevada licensed subsidiaries.” 
We, along with Mandalay Resort Group, a
re required to be registered by the Nevada Commission as publicly traded corporations (collectively, the “Nevadaregistered corporat
ions”) and Mirage Resorts, Incorporated is required to be registered as an intermediary company and, as such, each of us is required periodicallyto submit detailed fin
ancial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission and furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may require.  No personmay become a stockholder o
r member of, or 

 receive any percent
age of profits from, the Nevada licensed subsidiaries without first registering with (for equity ownership of 5% or less), or obtaining licenses andapprovals from the Nevada Gam
ing Authorities .   Additionally, the local authorities have taken the position that they have the authority to approve all personsowning or controlling the stock of 
any corporation controlling a gaming licensee .   The Nevada registered corporations, Mirage Resorts, Incorporated and theNevada licensed subsidiari
es have obtained from the Nevada Gaming Authorities the various registrations, approvals, permits, and licenses required in order toengage in gaming activi
ties in Nevada. 
The Nevada Gaming Authorities may 
investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, the Nevada registeredcorporations or any of the Nevad
a licensed subsidiaries to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaminglicensee.  Officers, di
rectors, and certain key employees of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and may berequired to be licensed by 
the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  Officers, directors, and key employees of the Nevada registered corporations who are actively anddirectly involved in the g
aming activities of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada GamingAuthorities.  The Nevada Gaming Authori
ties may deny an application for licensing or a finding of suitability for any cause they deem reasonable.  A finding ofsuitability is compar
able to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation.  Theapplicant for licens
ing or a finding of suitability, or the gaming licensee by which the applicant is employed or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costsof the investigation.  Changes in 
licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities, and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for afinding of suitability or 
licensure, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position. 
If the Nevada Gaming Authoriti
es were to find an officer, director, or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with theNevada registered corpor
ations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries, such Nevada registered corporations or Nevada licensed subsidiaries, as applicable, would haveto sever all relat
ionships with that person.  In addition, the Nevada Commission may require the Nevada registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiariesto terminate the e
mployment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Determinations of suitability or of questions pertaining to licensing are notsubject to judicial r
eview in Nevada. 
The Nevada registered corpo
rations and the Nevada casino licensees are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the NevadaCommission.  Substantially all o
f the Nevada registered corporations’ and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries’ material loans, leases, sales of securities, and similarfinancing transactions 
must be reported to or approved by the Nevada Commission. 
If the Nevada Commission dete
rmined that we or a Nevada licensed subsidiary violated the Nevada Act, it could limit, condition, suspend, or revoke, subject tocompliance with cert
ain statutory and regulatory procedures, our gaming licenses and those of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries.  In addition, the Nevada registeredcorporations and the Nevada l
icensed subsidiaries and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at thediscretion of the Nevada Comm
ission.  Further, a supervisor could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate the gaming establishments and, under certaincircumstances, earn
ings generated during the supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the gaming establishments) could be forfeited to theState of Nevada.  Limitat
ion, conditioning, or suspension of any gaming license or the appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of any gaming licensewould) materially adve
rsely affect our gaming operations. 
Any beneficial holder of our vo
ting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his orher suitability as a ben
eficial holder of the voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise beinconsistent with the decl
ared policies of the State of Nevada.  The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities inconducting any such investigat
ion. 
The Nevada Act requires any person who a
cquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission.  TheNevada Act requires that ben
eficial owners of more than 10% of any class of our voting securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitabilitywithin 30 days after the Chair
man of the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing.  Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor” asdefined in the Nevada Act, which a
cquires more than 10% but not more than 25% of any class of our voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Commission for awaiver of such finding of suitab
ility if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only.  An institutional investor that has obtaineda waiver may, in certa
in circumstances, own up to 29% of the voting securities of a registered company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver. 
An institutional investor wil
l be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes if it acquires and holds the voting securities in the ordinary course ofbusiness as an institutional 
investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of our board of directors, anychange in our corporate ch
arter, bylaws, management, policies, or operations, or any of our gaming affiliates, or any other action that the Nevada Commission findsto be inconsistent with holding our
 
2

 voting securities for inv
estment purposes only .   Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes onlyinclude:
 
 
·voting on all matters vot ed on by stockholders; 
 
·making financial and oth er inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a changein its management, poli
cies, or operations; and 
 
·such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. 
If the beneficial ho
lder of voting securities who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, or trust, it must submit detailed business and financialinformation including a 
list of beneficial owners.  The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation. 
Any person who fails or refuses to apply 
for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or theChairman of the Nevada Board, or who re
fuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with investigation ofits application, may be 
found unsuitable.  The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner.  Anystockholder found unsuitable and who holds, d
irectly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our common stock beyond such period of time as may be prescribedby the Nevada Commission may be guil
ty of a criminal offense.  We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be astockholder or to have any othe
r relationship with us or a Nevada licensed subsidiary, we or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries: 
 
·pays that person any dividend or in terest upon any of our voting securities; 
 
·allows that person to exerc ise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; 
 
·pays remuneration in any fo rm to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or 
 
·fails to pursue all lawfu l efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities including if necessary, the immediate purchaseof the voting securities
 for cash at fair market value. 
The Nevada Commission may, in its dis
cretion, require the holder of any debt security of the Nevada registered corporations to file an application, beinvestigated, and be found suit
able to hold the debt security.  If the Nevada Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant tothe Nevada Act, the registe
red corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it: 
 
·pays to the unsuitable person any d ividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever; 
 
·recognizes any voting right by su ch unsuitable person in connection with such securities; 
 
·pays the unsuitable person re muneration in any form; or 
 
·makes any payment to the unsui table person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation, or similar transaction. 
We are required to m
aintain a current stock ledger in Nevada that may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time.  If any securities are held intrust by an agent or by a nomine
e, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  A failure tomake such disclosure may be g
rounds for finding the record holder unsuitable.  We are also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of thebeneficial owner.  The Nevada Com
mission has the power to require the Nevada registered corporations’ stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that suchsecurities are subje
ct to the Nevada Act.  However, to date, the Nevada Commission has not imposed such a requirement on the Nevada registered corporations. 
The Nevada registered corpo
rations may not make a public offering of any securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securities orthe proceeds therefro
m are intended to be used to construct, acquire, or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for thosepurposes or for similar purpos
es.  An approval, if given, does not 
3

 constitute a finding, re
commendation, or approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada Board as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or theinvestment merits of 
the securities .   Any representation to the contrary is unlawful. 
On July 24, 2014, the Nevada Commission granted th
e Nevada registered corporations prior approval to make public offerings for a period of three years,subject to certain cond
itions. 
Changes in control of the Nevada r
egistered corporations through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, orany act or conduct by a person wher
eby he or she obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission.  Entities seeking to acquirecontrol of a register
ed corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada Commission concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming controlof the registered corpo
ration.  The Nevada Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and other persons having a materialrelationship or involvem
ent with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction. 
The Nevada legislature has d
eclared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities, and corporate defensive tacticsaffecting Nevada gaming lice
nsees and registered corporations that are affiliated with those operations may be injurious to stable and productive corporategaming.  The Nevada Commission has est
ablished a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada’sgaming industry and to furthe
r Nevada’s policy to: 
 
·assure the financial stability  of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates; 
 
·preserve the benefic ial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and 
 
·promote a neutral environme nt for the orderly governance of corporate affairs. 
Approvals are, in certain 
circumstances, required from the Nevada Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above thecurrent market pri
ce and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated.  The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan ofrecapitalizat
ion proposed by a registered corporation’s board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to the registered corporation’s stockholders forthe purpose of acquiring cont
rol of that corporation. 
License fees and taxes, co
mputed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the localauthorities.  Depending upon the pa
rticular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly, or annually and are based upon either: 
 
·a percentage of the gross revenues received; 
 
·the number of gaming devic es operated; or 
 
·the number of table gam es operated. 
The tax on gross revenues rece
ived is generally 6.75%.  A live entertainment tax is also paid on charges for admission to any facility where certain forms of liveentertainment ar
e provided.  The Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees also pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada. 
Because we are involved in gam
ing ventures outside of Nevada, we are required to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund inthe amount of $10,000 to pay the expens
es of investigation by the Nevada Board of our participation in such foreign gaming.  The revolving fund is subject toincrease or decreas
e at the discretion of the Nevada Commission.  Thereafter, we are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by theNevada Act.  We would be subject to dis
ciplinary action by the Nevada Commission if we: 
 
·knowingly violate any laws of the fo reign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation; 
 
·fail to conduct the for eign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations; 
 
4

  
·engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflectsor tends to reflect dis
credit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;   
 
·engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or 
 
·employ, contract with, or asso ciate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada onthe ground of personal unsuitabi
lity, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling. 
The sale of alcoholic bev
erages by the Nevada licensed subsidiaries is subject to licensing, control, and regulation by the applicable local authorities.  Alllicenses are revocab
le and are not transferable.  The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend, or revoke any such license, and any suchdisciplinary action cou
ld (and revocation would) have a material adverse effect upon our operations.
Michigan
Government
Regulation
and
Taxation
 
The Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Ac
t (the “Michigan Act”) subjects the owners and operators of casino gaming facilities to extensive state licensingand regulatory require
ments.  The Michigan Act also authorizes local regulation of casino gaming facilities by the City of Detroit, provided that any such localordinances regulating c
asino gaming are consistent with the Michigan Act and rules promulgated to implement it.  We are subject to the Michigan Act through ourownership interest in MGM Grand Detroi
t, LLC (the “licensed subsidiary”) which operates MGM Grand Detroit.  Our ownership interest in MGM Grand Detroit,LLC is held by our wholly-owned subsidiary MGM Grand Detroi
t, Inc. 
The Michigan Act creates 
the Michigan Gaming Control Board (the “Michigan Board”) and authorizes it to grant casino licenses to not more than threeapplicants who have entered 
into development agreements with the City of Detroit.  The Michigan Board is granted extensive authority to conduct backgroundinvestigations and determi
ne the suitability of casino license applicants, affiliated companies, officers, directors, or managerial employees of applicants and affiliatedcompanies and persons or enti
ties holding a one percent or greater direct or indirect interest in an applicant or affiliated company.  Institutional investors holding lessthan certain specified amount
s of our debt or equity securities are exempted from meeting the suitability requirements of the Michigan Act since we are a publiclytraded corporation, and prov
ided that the securities were purchased for investment purposes only and not for the purpose of influencing or affecting our affairs.  Anyperson who supplies goods or services to th
e licensed subsidiary which are directly related to, used in connection with, or affecting gaming, and any person whosupplies other goods or services 
to the licensed subsidiary on a regular and continuing basis, must obtain a supplier’s license from the Michigan Board.  In addition,any individual employed by the 
licensed subsidiary or by a supplier licensee whose work duties are related to or involved in the gaming operation or are performedin a restricted ar
ea or a gaming area of the licensed subsidiary must obtain an occupational license from the Michigan Board. 
The Michigan Act imposes the burd
en of proof on the applicant for a casino license to establish its suitability to receive and hold the license.  The applicantmust establish its suitab
ility as to integrity, moral character and reputation, business probity, financial ability and experience, responsibility, and other criteriadeemed appropriate by th
e Michigan Board.  A casino license is valid for a period of one year and the Michigan Board may refuse to renew it upon a determinationthat the licensee no long
er meets the requirements for licensure. 
The Michigan Board may, among othe
r things, revoke, suspend or restrict the licensed subsidiary’s casino license.  The licensed subsidiary is also subject tofines or forfeiture o
f assets for violations of gaming or liquor control laws or rules.  In the event that the licensed subsidiary’s license is revoked or suspended formore than 120 days, the Michigan Ac
t provides for the appointment of a conservator who, among other things, is required to preserve the assets to ensure that theyshall continue to be opera
ted in a sound and businesslike manner, or upon order of the Michigan Board, to sell or otherwise transfer the assets to another person orentity who meets the requi
rements of the Michigan Act for licensure, subject to certain approvals and consultations. 
The Michigan Board has adopted adm
inistrative rules to implement the terms of the Michigan Act.  Among other things, the rules impose more detailedsubstantive and procedural 
requirements with respect to casino licensing and operations. 
Included are require
ments regarding such things as licensing investigations and hearings, record keeping and retention, contracting, reports to the MichiganBoard, internal control and 
accounting procedures, security and surveillance, extensions of credit to gaming patrons, conduct of gaming, and transfers of ownershipinterests in licensed 
casinos.  The rules also establish numerous 
5

 Michigan Board procedures reg
arding licensing, disciplinary and other hearings, and similar matters .   The rules have the force of law and are binding on theMichigan Board as well as on appli
cants for or holders of casino licenses. 
Under rules of the Michigan Board, 
a person or company which intends to acquire shares representing more than a 5% equity interest in a publicly tradedcompany which is the holding company o
f a Michigan casino licensee must obtain approval of the acquisition from the Michigan Board.  Subsequent to theacquisition, the person or co
mpany acquiring the shares must be determined by the Michigan Board to be “suitable” and “qualified” to own the shares.  In addition, ifthe acquisition is by a comp
any, “key persons” in the company (generally the officers, directors, managerial employees, and significant owners) must also bedetermined to be “suitable” a
nd “qualified.” “Institutional investors” (as that term is defined in the Michigan Act) may generally obtain a waiver from theserequirements if the 
institutional investor has less than 15% ownership interest in the publicly traded company.  Upon attaining equity ownership of 5% or more, orfiling Schedule 13D or 13G with the SEC, the Michig
an Board must be notified by the investor.  Unless otherwise ordered by the Michigan Board, institutionalinvestors acquiring less th
an 10% equity ownership in the publicly traded company are entitled to an exemption from the approval requirements, but are required tofile an institutiona
l waiver application with the Michigan Board.  Institutional investors acquiring 10% or more equity ownership must apply for an institutionalwaiver, supplying certain in
formation delineated in Rule 504(3).  Pursuant to Rule 504(4), institutional investors acquiring more than 15% equity ownership mustapply to the Michigan Board for 
approval of the acquisition within 45 days after it occurs.  The institutional investor and its key persons may be subject to suitabilityand qualification det
erminations. 
The term “institution
al investor” includes financial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, etc.  The shares held by the institutionalinvestor must be held for inv
estment purposes only.  The following activities are deemed consistent with holding the shares for investment purposes:  voting byproxy furnished by the board of dir
ectors, on all matters voted on by the holders of the voting securities; serving as a member of a committee of creditors or securityholders formed in connect
ion with a debt restructuring; nominating a candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with a debtrestructuring; acc
epting appointment or election as a member of the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring and serving in that capacity until theconclusion of the member
’s term; making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for information purposes andnot to cause a change in its 
management, policies, or operations; and other activities that the board determines to be consistent with the investment intent. 
The Michigan Liquor Control Commission 
licenses, controls and regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages by the licensed subsidiary pursuant to the MichiganLiquor Control Code of 1998.  The Michigan Act a
lso requires that the licensed subsidiary sell in a manner consistent with the Michigan Liquor Control Code. 
The Detroit City Council enact
ed an ordinance entitled “Casino Gaming Authorization and Casino Development Agreement Certification andCompliance.”  The ordinance 
authorizes casino gaming only by operators who are licensed by the Michigan Board and are parties to a development agreement whichhas been approved and certi
fied by the City Council and is currently in effect, or are acting on behalf of such parties.  The development agreement among the City ofDetroit, MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and the Econom
ic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit has been so approved and certified and is currently ineffect.  Under the ordinan
ce, the licensed subsidiary is required to submit to the Mayor of Detroit and to the City Council periodic reports regarding its compliancewith the development agre
ement or, in the event of non-compliance, reasons for non-compliance and an explanation of efforts to comply.  The ordinance requires theMayor of Detroit to monitor 
each casino operator’s compliance with its development agreement, to take appropriate enforcement action in the event of default and tonotify the City Council of defau
lts and enforcement action taken; and, if a development agreement is terminated, it requires the City Council to transmit notice ofsuch action to the Michigan Boa
rd within five business days along with Detroit’s request that the Michigan Board revoke the relevant operator’s casino license.  If adevelopment agreemen
t is terminated, the Michigan Act requires the Michigan Board to revoke the relevant operator’s casino license upon the request of Detroit. 
The administrative rules of
 the Michigan Board prohibit the licensed subsidiary or us from entering into a debt transaction affecting the capitalization orfinancial viabili
ty of MGM Grand Detroit without prior approval from the Michigan Board.  On October 14, 2003, the Michigan Board authorized the licensedsubsidiary to borrow under our cred
it facilities for the purpose of financing the development of its permanent casino and any future expansion of, or maintenancecapital expenditures 
for, the permanent casino, and to secure such borrowings with liens upon substantially all of its assets.  In the same order, the Michigan Boardauthorized MGM Grand Detroit, Inc.  
to pledge its equity interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC to secure such borrowings.  Enforcement of a security interest in suchequity interest is li
mited by the Michigan Act and the rules of the Michigan Board.  Specifically, acquisitions resulting in an interest of more than one percent of anentity, other than a publi
cly traded corporation, holding a casino license are subject to the approval of the Michigan Board, and persons acquiring such interests mustbe found suitable by the Michig
an Board. 
The Michigan Act effect
ively provides for a wagering tax equal to 19% of adjusted gross receipts from gaming operations conducted at a casino.  Proceeds ofthe wagering tax are shar
ed between the State of Michigan and the City of Detroit.  In addition to 
6

 the wagering tax, the Michig
an Act establishes an annual municipal service fee equal to the greater of $4 million or 1.25% of adjusted gross receipts to be paid toDetroit to defray its cos
t of hosting casinos, and an annual assessment, as adjusted annually based upon a consumer price index, in the initial amount ofapproximately $8.3 mill
ion to be paid to Michigan to defray its regulatory enforcement and other casino-related costs .   These payments are in addition to the taxes,fees and assessments custom
arily paid by business entities situated in Detroit .   The licensed subsidiary is also obligated to pay 1% of its adjusted gross receipts toDetroit, to be increased 
to 2% of its adjusted gross receipts in any calendar year in which adjusted gross receipts exceed $400 million.
Mississippi
Government
Regulation
 
We conduct our Mississippi gam
ing operations through two indirect subsidiaries, Beau Rivage Resorts, Inc., which owns and operates Beau Rivage in Biloxi,Mississippi, and MGM Resorts Mississippi, Inc., whi
ch owns and operates the Gold Strike Casino in Tunica County, Mississippi (collectively, the “casinolicensees”).  The ownership and op
eration of casino facilities in Mississippi are subject to extensive state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing andregulatory control of th
e Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi Department of Revenue. 
The Mississippi Gaming Control Act (th
e “Mississippi Act”) legalized casino gaming in Mississippi.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted regulationsin furtherance of the M
ississippi Act.  The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming Commission seek to: 
 
·prevent unsavory or unsuitable p ersons from having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; 
 
·establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures; 
 
·maintain effective control over t he financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and safeguardingof assets and revenues, providing 
reliable record keeping and making periodic reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission; 
 
·prevent cheating and fr audulent practices; 
 
·provide a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and 
 
·ensure that gaming lic ensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents. 
The regulations are subje
ct to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  Changes in Mississippi law or the regulations or theMississippi Gaming Commission’s int
erpretations thereof may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted, and could have amaterial adverse 
effect on us and our Mississippi gaming operations. 
The Mississippi Act provides for l
egalized gaming at the discretion of the 14 counties that either border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River, but only if thevoters in such counties have not vo
ted to prohibit gaming in that county.  As of December 31, 2015, gaming was permissible in nine of the 14 eligible counties in thestate and gaming operat
ions had commenced in Adams, Coahoma, Hancock, Harrison, Tunica, Warren and Washington counties.  Prior to Hurricane Katrina,Mississippi law required tha
t gaming vessels be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the Mississippi River, or in thewaters of the State of Mississ
ippi lying south of the state in eligible counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, changes to the lawbecame effectiv
e which allowed gaming facilities to be constructed on land in the three Gulf Coast counties, provided that no portion of the gaming facilities islocated more than 800 fe
et from the mean high water line of the Mississippi Sound or designated bays on the Sound.  The 800-foot limit does not apply to non-gaming facilities.  Th
e law permits unlimited stakes gaming on permanently moored dockside vessels or in land-based facilities on a 24-hour basis and does notrestrict the perc
entage of space which may be utilized for gaming.  There are no limitations on the number of gaming licenses which may be issued in Mississippi. 
The casino licensees ar
e subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  Gaming licenses require the periodic paymentof fees and taxes and are no
t transferable.  Gaming licenses are issued for a maximum term of three years and must be renewed periodically thereafter.  The currentlicenses of the casino l
icensees are effective through June 22, 2018. 
We are registered by 
the Mississippi Gaming Commission under the Mississippi Act as a publicly traded holding company of the casino licensees.  As aregistered publicly t
raded corporation, we are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and are required to periodicallysubmit detailed finan
cial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and furnish any other information which the Mississippi GamingCommission may require.  If we 
are unable to satisfy 
7

 the registration requ
irements of the Mississippi Act, we and our casino licensees cannot own or operate gaming facilities in Mississippi .   The casino licensees arealso required to periodi
cally submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi Department ofRevenue and to furnish any other in
formation required thereby .   With certain exceptions, no person may become a stockholder of or receive any percentage ofprofits from the casino 
licensees without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Mississippi Gaming Commission. 
Certain of our officers, d
irectors and employees must be found suitable or be licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  We believe that we haveapplied for all necess
ary findings of suitability with respect to these persons, although the Mississippi Gaming Commission, in its discretion, may require additionalpersons to file applica
tions for findings of suitability.  In addition, any person having a material relationship or involvement with us may be required to be foundsuitable, in which case those p
ersons must pay the costs and fees associated with the investigation.  A finding of suitability requires submission of detailed personaland financial inform
ation followed by a thorough investigation.  There can be no assurance that a person who is subject to a finding of suitability will be foundsuitable by the Mississippi Gam
ing Commission.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission may deny an application for a finding of suitability for any cause that itdeems reasonable.  Findings of sui
tability must be periodically renewed. 
Changes in certain licens
ed positions must be reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  In addition to its authority to deny an application for a findingof suitability, the Mississ
ippi Gaming Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a licensed position.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has thepower to require us to suspend or dism
iss officers, directors and other key employees or sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriateapplications or whom
 the authorities find unsuitable to act in their capacities. 
Employees associated with ga
ming must obtain work permits that are subject to immediate suspension.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission will refuse toissue a work permit to a person 
convicted of a felony and it may refuse to issue a work permit to a gaming employee if the employee has committed variousmisdemeanors or knowingly viola
ted the Mississippi Act or for any other reasonable cause. 
At any time, the Mississippi Gam
ing Commission has the power to investigate and require a finding of suitability of any of our record or beneficialstockholders, regardless of 
the percentage of ownership.  Mississippi law requires any person who acquires more than 5% of our voting securities to report theacquisition to the Mississipp
i Gaming Commission, and that person may be required to be found suitable.  Also, any person who becomes a beneficial owner of morethan 10% of our voting securit
ies, as reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, must apply for a finding of suitability by the Mississippi GamingCommission.  An applicant for find
ing of suitability must pay the costs and fees that the Mississippi Gaming Commission incurs in conducting the investigation. 
The Mississippi Gaming Commission has gen
erally exercised its discretion to require a finding of suitability of any beneficial owner of more than 5% of aregistered public or pr
ivate company’s voting securities.  However, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has adopted a regulation that permits certain institutionalinvestors to own beneficial
ly up to 15% and, under certain circumstances, up to 19%, of a registered or licensed company’s voting securities without a finding ofsuitability.  Under the regu
lations, an “institutional investor,” as defined therein, may apply to the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission for awaiver of a finding of suitab
ility if such institutional investor (i) beneficially owns up to 15% (or, in certain circumstances, up to 19%) of the voting securities of aregistered or licens
ed company, and (ii) holds the voting securities for investment purposes only.  An institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold votingsecurities for invest
ment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not forthe purpose of causing, direc
tly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the registered or licensed company, any change inthe registered or li
censed company’s corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered public or private company or any of its gamingaffiliates, or any oth
er action which the Mississippi Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered or licensed company’s voting securitiesfor investment purposes only.
 
Activities that are no
t deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include: 
 
·voting, directly or indir ectly through the delivery of a proxy furnished by the board of directors, on all matters voted upon by the holders of such votingsecurities;
 
 
·serving as a member of any committee of creditors or security holders formed in connection with a debt restructuring; 
 
·nominating any candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring; 
 
·accepting appointment or electi on (or having a representative accept appointment or election) as a member of the board of directors in connection with adebt restructuring and se
rving in that capacity until the conclusion of the member’s term; 
 
8

  
·making financial and oth er inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a changein management, polici
es or operations; and   
 
·such other activities as the Mississippi Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. 
If a stockholder who must be found sui
table is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list ofbeneficial owners.  The Mississ
ippi Gaming Commission may at any time dissolve, suspend, condition, limit or restrict a finding of suitability to own a registeredpublic company’s equity int
erests for any cause it deems reasonable. 
We may be required to dis
close to the Mississippi Gaming Commission upon request the identities of the holders of any of our debt or other securities.  Inaddition, under the Mississippi Ac
t, the Mississippi Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require holders of our debt securities to file applications, investigatethe holders, and require th
e holders to be found suitable to own the debt securities. 
Although the Mississippi Gaming Commission g
enerally does not require the individual holders of obligations such as notes to be investigated and foundsuitable, the Mississippi Gam
ing Commission retains the discretion to do so for any reason, including but not limited to a default, or where the holder of the debtinstrument exercises 
a material influence over the gaming operations of the entity in question.  Any holder of debt securities required to apply for a finding ofsuitability must pay al
l investigative fees and costs of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection with the investigation. 
Any person who fails or refuses to apply 
for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Mississippi GamingCommission may be found unsuitable.  Any pe
rson found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our securities beyond the timethat the Mississippi Gaming Comm
ission prescribes, may be guilty of a misdemeanor.  After receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder, a holderof our debt securities or 
to have any other relationship with us, we will be subject to disciplinary action if we: 
 
·pay the unsuitable person any div idend, interest or other distribution whatsoever; 
 
·recognize the exerc ise, directly or indirectly, of any voting rights conferred through such securities held by the unsuitable person; 
 
·pay the unsuitable person any r emuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in limited and specific circumstances; 
 
·make any payment to the unsui table person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction; or 
 
·fail to pursue all lawful  efforts to require the unsuitable person to divest himself or herself of the securities, including, if necessary, the immediatepurchase of the securities
 for cash at a fair market value. 
The casino licensees must 
maintain in Mississippi a current ledger with respect to the ownership of their equity securities and we must maintain in Mississippi acurrent list of our stockho
lders which must reflect the record ownership of each outstanding share of any equity security issued by us.  The ledger and stockholderlists must be availabl
e for inspection by the Mississippi Gaming Commission at any time.  If any of our securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, therecord holder may be requ
ired to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  A failure to make that disclosure may begrounds for finding the record ho
lder unsuitable.  We must also render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner. 
The Mississippi 
Act requires that the certificates representing securities of a registered publicly traded corporation bear a legend to the general effect that thesecurities are subje
ct to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  On May 28, 2009, the Mississippi Gaming Commissiongranted us a waiver of this l
egend requirement.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to impose additional restrictions on us and the holders of oursecurities at any time.
 
Substantially all loans, l
eases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by the casino licensees must be reported to or approved by the MississippiGaming Commission.  The licensed subsid
iaries may not make a public offering of their securities, but may pledge or mortgage casino facilities with the priorapproval of the Mississippi Gam
ing Commission.  We may not make a public offering of our securities without the prior approval of the Mississippi GamingCommission if any part of the p
roceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the construction, acquisition or operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or to retireor extend obligations incur
red for those purposes.  The approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the accuracy or adequacy of 
9

 the prospectus or the invest
ment merits of the securities subject to the offering .   Effective June 23, 2015 , the Mississippi Gaming Commission gr anted us a waiverof the prior approval requ
irement for our securities offerings for a period of three years, subject to certain conditions .   The waiver may be rescinded for good causewithout prior notice upon the issu
ance of an interlocutory stop order by the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. 
Under the regulations of the M
ississippi Gaming Commission, the casino licensees may not guarantee a security issued by us pursuant to a public offering, orpledge their assets to se
cure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by such a security issued by us, without the prior approval of the MississippiGaming Commission.  Similarly, we m
ay not pledge the stock or other ownership interests of the casino licensees, nor may the pledgee of such ownership interestsforeclose on such a pledge, withou
t the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued byus and agreements not to encu
mber such securities granted by us are ineffective without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  The waiver ofthe prior approval requi
rement for our securities offerings received from the Mississippi Gaming Commission effective June 23, 2015 includes a waiver of the priorapproval requirement 
for such guarantees, pledges and restrictions of the casino licensees, subject to certain conditions. 
We cannot change our contro
l through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover without theprior approval of the Mississ
ippi Gaming Commission.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, andother persons having a mate
rial relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approvalprocess relating to the 
transaction. 
The Mississippi Legislature h
as declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and other corporatedefensive tactics th
at affect corporate gaming licensees in Mississippi and corporations whose stock is publicly traded that are affiliated with those licensees may beinjurious to stable and produc
tive corporate gaming.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverseeffects of these business p
ractices upon Mississippi’s gaming industry and to further Mississippi’s policy to assure the financial stability of corporate gamingoperators and their affiliates,
 preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form, and promote a neutral environment for the orderlygovernance of corporate 
affairs. 
We may be required to obt
ain approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission before we may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities in excessof the current marke
t price of its common stock (commonly called “greenmail”) or before we may consummate a corporate acquisition opposed bymanagement.  The regula
tions also require prior approval by the Mississippi Gaming Commission if we adopt a plan of recapitalization proposed by our Board ofDirectors opposing a tender of
fer made directly to the stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of us. 
Neither we nor the casino li
censees may engage in gaming activities in Mississippi while we, the casino licensees and/or persons found suitable to be associatedwith the gaming license of 
the casino licensees conduct gaming operations outside of Mississippi without approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  TheMississippi Gaming Commission may r
equire that it have access to information concerning our, and our affiliates’, out-of-state gaming operations.  We believe thatwe have applied for all ne
cessary waivers of foreign gaming approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission for the conduct of our active or planned gamingoperations outside of Mississipp
i. 
If the Mississippi Gaming Commiss
ion decides that the casino licensees violated a gaming law or regulation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could limit,condition, suspend or revoke the l
icense of the subsidiary.  In addition, we, the casino licensees and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines foreach separate viola
tion.  A violation under any of our other operating subsidiaries’ gaming licenses may be deemed a violation of the casino licensees’ gaminglicense.
 
Because of a violation, the M
ississippi Gaming Commission could attempt to appoint a supervisor to operate the casino facilities.  Limitation, conditioning orsuspension of the casino licens
ees’ gaming license or our registration as a publicly traded holding company, or the appointment of a supervisor could, and therevocation of any gaming l
icense or registration would, materially adversely affect our Mississippi gaming operations. 
The casino licensees must p
ay license fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming involved, to the State of Mississippi and tothe county or city in which the 
licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations.  Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payableeither monthly, quarte
rly or annually and are based upon a percentage of gross gaming revenues, the number of slot machines operated by the casino, and the numberof table games operat
ed by the casino. 
The license fee payabl
e to the State of Mississippi is based upon “gross revenues,” generally defined as cash receipts less cash payouts to customers aswinnings, and generally equals 8% o
f gross revenue.  These license fees are allowed as a credit against our Mississippi income tax liability for the year paid.  Thegross revenue fee imposed by th
e Mississippi cities and counties in which 
10

 casino operations are lo
cated is in addition to the fees payable to the State of Mississippi and equals approximately 4% of gross revenue. 
The Mississippi Gaming Commission adopt
ed a regulation in 1994 requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment’s planinclude a 500-car parkin
g facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities which will amount to at least 25% of the casinocost.  Infrastructure 
facilities are defined in the regulation to include a hotel with at least 250 rooms, theme park, golf course and other similar facilities.  BeauRivage and Gold Strike Tunica are 
in compliance with this requirement.  On January 21, 1999, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted an amendment to thisregulation which increas
ed the infrastructure requirement to 100% from the existing 25%; however, the regulation grandfathers existing licensees and applies only tonew casino projects and casinos 
that are not operating at the time of acquisition or purchase, and would therefore not apply to Beau Rivage and Gold StrikeTunica.  In any event, Beau Rivage and Gold St
rike Tunica would comply with such requirement.  On February 21, 2013, the Mississippi Gaming Commissionadopted further amendm
ents to this regulation to impose additional requirements on new casino projects.  However, the amended regulation grandfathers anylicensee who has been licens
ed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission prior to December 31, 2013; therefore, the amendments do not apply to Beau Rivage or GoldStrike Tunica.
 
Both the local jurisdict
ion and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Mississippi Department of Revenue license, control and regulate the sale ofalcoholic beverages by th
e casino licensees.  Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in areas designated as special resort areas, which allows casinos located thereinto serve alcoholic beve
rages on a 24-hour basis.  The Alcoholic Beverage Control Division requires that our key officers and managers and the casino licensees’ keyofficers and managers 
and all owners of more than 5% of the casino licensees’ equity submit detailed personal, and in some instances, financial information to theAlcoholic Beverage Control Division 
and be investigated and licensed.  All such licenses are non-transferable.  The Alcohol Beverage Control Division has the fullpower to limit, condition, suspend o
r revoke any license for the service of alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee on probation with or without conditions.  Anydisciplinary action cou
ld, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon the casino’s operations.
Illinois
Government
Regulation
 
Our 50% joint venture ownership int
erest in Grand Victoria Riverboat Casino, located in Elgin, Illinois (“Grand Victoria”) is subject to extensive stateregulation under the Il
linois Riverboat Gambling Act (the “Illinois Act”) and the regulations of the Illinois Gaming Board (the “Illinois Board”). 
In February 1990, the State of Il
linois legalized riverboat gambling.  The Illinois Act authorizes the Illinois Board to issue up to ten riverboat gaming owners’licenses on any water within th
e State of Illinois or any water other than Lake Michigan which constitutes a boundary of the State of Illinois.  The Illinois Actrestricts the loca
tion of certain of the ten owners’ licenses.  Three of the licenses must be located on the Mississippi River.  One license must be at a location on theIllinois River south of Marsha
ll County and another license must be located on the Des Plaines River in Will County.  The remaining licenses are not restricted as tolocation.  Currently, all 
ten owner’s licenses are in operation in Alton, Aurora, East Peoria, East St.  Louis, Elgin, Metropolis, Rock Island, Des Plaines, and twolicenses in Joliet.
 
The Illinois Act strict
ly regulates the facilities, persons, associations and practices related to gaming operations.  It grants the Illinois Board specific powers andduties, and all other powers ne
cessary and proper to fully and effectively execute the Illinois Act for the purpose of administering, regulating and enforcing thesystem of riverboat gam
ing.  The Illinois Board has authority over every person, association, corporation, partnership and trust involved in riverboat gamingoperations in the State of 
Illinois. 
The Illinois Act requires 
the owner of a riverboat gaming operation to hold an owner’s license issued by the Illinois Board.  Each owner’s license permits theholder to own up to two riverboats as pa
rt of its gaming operation; however, gaming participants are limited to 1,200 for any owner’s license.  The number of gamingparticipants will be de
termined by the number of gaming positions available at any given time.  Gaming positions are counted as follows: 
 
·positions for electroni c gaming devices will be determined as 90% of the total number of devices available for play; 
 
·craps tables will be count ed as having ten gaming positions; and 
 
·games utilizing live g aming devices, except for craps, will be counted as having five gaming positions. 
Each owner’s license init
ially runs for a period of three years.  Thereafter, the license must be renewed annually.  The Board may renew an owner’s license forup to four years.  An owner licensee 
is eligible for renewal upon payment of the applicable fee and a determination by the Illinois Board that the licensee continuesto meet all of the r
equirements of the Illinois Act and Illinois Board’s 
11

 rules 
.   The owner’s license for Grand Victoria was issued in October 1994 and was renewed for a four-year period that ends in October 2016 .   An ownershipinterest in an owner’s li
cense may not be transferred or pledged as collateral without the prior approval of the Illinois Board. 
Pursuant to the Illinois Act, th
e Illinois Board established certain rules to follow in deciding whether to approve direct or indirect ownership or control of anowner’s license.  The Illino
is Board must consider the impact of any economic concentration caused by the ownership or control.  No direct or indirect ownership orcontrol may be approved which wil
l result in undue economic concentration of the ownership of a riverboat gambling operation in Illinois.  The Illinois Act specifiesa number of criteri
a for the Illinois Board to consider in determining whether the approval of the issuance, transfer or holding of a license will create undue economicconcentration.  The appli
cation of such criteria could reduce the number of potential purchasers for the Grand Victoria or our 50% joint venture interest therein. 
The Illinois Act does not lim
it the maximum bet or per patron loss.  Minimum and maximum wagers on games are set by the holder of the owner’slicense.  Wagering may no
t be conducted with money or other negotiable currency.  No person under the age of 21 is permitted to wager and wagers only may bereceived from a person p
resent on the riverboat.  With respect to electronic gaming devices, the payout percentage may not be less than 80% or more than 100%. 
Illinois imposes a number o
f taxes on Illinois casinos.  Such taxes are subject to change by the Illinois legislature and have been increased in the past.  TheIllinois legislatur
e also may impose new taxes on Grand Victoria’s activities.  Illinois currently imposes an admission tax of $2.00 per person for an owner licenseethat admitted 1,000,000 persons or 
fewer in the 2004 calendar year, and $3.00 per person for all other owner licensees (including Grand Victoria). 
Additionally, Illinois impos
es a wagering tax on the adjusted gross receipts, as defined in the Illinois Act, of a riverboat operation.  The owner licensee isrequired, on a daily basis, to wi
re the wagering tax payment to the Illinois Board.  Currently, the wagering tax is: 
 
·15.0% of adjusted gross receip ts up to and including $25.0 million; 
 
·22.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $25.0 million but not exceeding $50.0 million; 
 
·27.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $50.0 million but not exceeding $75.0 million; 
 
·32.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $75.0 million but not exceeding $100.0 million; 
 
·37.5% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $100.0 million but not exceeding $150.0 million; 
 
·45.0% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $150.0 million but not exceeding $200.0 million; and 
 
·50.0% of adjusted gross receip ts in excess of $200.0 million. 
A holder of any gaming license 
in Illinois is subject to imposition of fines, suspension or revocation of such license, or other action for any act or failure to actby the licensee or the l
icensee’s agents or employees, that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the people of the State ofIllinois, or that would discr
edit or tend to discredit the Illinois gaming industry or the State of Illinois.  The Illinois Board may revoke or suspend licenses, as theIllinois Board may deter
mine and, in compliance with applicable Illinois law regarding administrative procedures, may suspend an owner’s license, without notice orhearing, upon a determina
tion that the safety or health of patrons or employees is jeopardized by continuing a riverboat’s operation.  The suspension may remain ineffect until the I
llinois Board determines that the cause for suspension has been abated and it may revoke the owner’s license upon a determination that the owner hasnot made satisfactory p
rogress toward abating the hazard. 
If the Illinois Board has suspend
ed, revoked or refused to renew an owner’s license or if a riverboat gambling operation is closing and the owner is voluntarilysurrendering its owner’s li
cense, the Illinois Board may petition the local circuit court in which the riverboat is situated for appointment of a receiver.  The circuitcourt has sole jurisdict
ion over any and all issues pertaining to the appointment of a receiver.  The Illinois Board specifies the specific powers, duties and limitationsof the receiver.

 The Illinois Board requires 
that each “Key Person” of an owner licensee submit a Personal Disclosure or Business Entity Form and be investigated andapproved by the Illinois Board 
.   The Illinois Board determines which positions, individuals or Business Entities are required to be approved by the Board as KeyPersons 
.   Once approved, such Key Person status must be maintained .   Key Persons include: 
 
·any Business Entity and any individual wi th an ownership interest or voting rights of more than 5% in the licensee or applicant and the trustee of any trustholding such ownership interest or vo
ting rights; 
 
·the directors of the licensee  or applicant and its chief executive officer, president and chief operating officer or their functional equivalents; 
 
·a Gaming Operations Manager or any other business entity or individual who has influence and/or control over the conduct of gaming or the RiverboatGaming Operation; and
 
 
·all other individuals or Busin ess Entities that, upon review of the applicant’s or licensees Table of Organization, Ownership and Control the Boarddetermines hold a position o
r a level of ownership, control or influence that is material to the regulatory concerns and obligations of the Illinois Board forthe specified licens
ee or applicant. 
Each owner licensee must prov
ide a means for the economic disassociation of a Key Person in the event such economic disassociation is required by an order ofthe Illinois Board.  Based upon findings 
from an investigation into the character, reputation, experience, associations, business probity and financial integrity of aKey Person, the Illinois Board may en
ter an order upon the licensee or require the economic disassociation of the Key Person. 
Applicants for and holders of an owne
r’s license are required to obtain the Illinois Board’s approval for changes in the following:  (i) Key Persons; (ii) type ofentity; (iii) equity and de
bt capitalization of the entity; (iv) investors and/or debt holders; (v) source of funds; (vi) applicant’s economic development plan;(vii) riverboat capacity or si
gnificant design change; (viii) gaming positions; (ix) anticipated economic impact; or (x) agreements, oral or written, relating to theacquisition or disposition of p
roperty (real or personal) of a value greater than $1 million.  Illinois regulations provide that a holder of an owner’s license may makedistributions to its stockhold
ers only to the extent that such distributions do not impair the financial viability of the owner. 
The Illinois Board requires 
each holder of an owner’s license to obtain the Illinois Board’s approval prior to issuing a guaranty of anyindebtedness.  Accordingly, we and 
our subsidiaries with a dire ct interest in Grand Victoria intend to petition the I llinois Board to allow those subsidiaries to issue subsidiary 
guaranties of any indebtedness that we incu r in the future to the extent such guaranties are required by our lenders.  Although we and those subsidiaries believe the Illinois Boa
rd will continue to approve our petitions and allow such guaranties of our futur e indebtedness, there can be no assurance that the IllinoisBoard will continue to grant th
e necessary approvals. 
The Illinois Board requires 
that each “institutional investor,” as that term is defined by Illinois Board, that, individually or jointly with others, cumulativelyacquires, directly or 
indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation shall,within no less than ten days aft
er acquiring such securities, notify the Illinois Board of such ownership and shall, upon request, provide such additional informationas may be required by the I
llinois Board.  An institutional investor that, individually or jointly with others, cumulatively acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or moreof any class of voting securi
ties of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation shall file an “Institutional Investor Disclosure Form,”provided by the Illinois Board, with
in 45 days after cumulatively acquiring such level of ownership interest, unless such requirement is waived by the IllinoisBoard.  Based upon the current position o
f the Illinois Board, ownership interest in a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation is calculated based on thepublicly-traded paren
t corporation’s ownership in the licensee.  Accordingly, an institutional investor that owns 5% of any class of our voting securities should onlybe considered a 2.5% owner for th
e basis of the regulations of the Illinois Board based on our 50% ownership in Grand Victoria.  Additionally, we must notify theIllinois Board as soon as possible a
fter we become aware that we are involved in an ownership acquisition by an institutional investor. 
The Illinois Board may waive any 
licensing requirement or procedure provided by rule if it determines that the waiver is in the best interests of the public andthe gaming industry.  Also, the Il
linois Board may, from time to time, amend or change its rules. 
On January 1, 2008, Illinois’ statewid
e public smoking ban became effective.  Smoking is now illegal in Illinois’ casinos, bars, restaurants and other publicestablishments.  This may con
tinue to negatively impact the gaming industry in Illinois. 
From time to time, var
ious proposals have been introduced in the Illinois legislature that, if enacted, would affect the taxation, regulation, operation or otheraspects of the gaming indust
ry.  The Illinois legislature regularly considers proposals that would expand 
13

 gaming opportunities in Il
linois .   Some of this legislation, if enacted, could adversely affect the gaming industry .   No assurance can be given whether such orsimilar legislat
ion will be enacted. 
The Illinois legislatu
re continues to discuss the possibility of gaming expansion.  This expansion could include several new casinos (including one in Chicago),increased gaming positions 
in existing casinos, as well as gaming positions at Illinois racetracks.  If gaming expansion occurs, Grand Victoria’s operating resultscould be adversely impac
ted by the increased competition. 
On July 13, 2009, Illinois enacted the Vid
eo Gaming Act, which legalizes the use of up to five video gaming terminals in most bars, restaurants, fraternalorganizations and veter
ans’ organizations holding valid Illinois liquor licenses, as well as at qualifying truck stops.  The Illinois Board adopted a set of Regulationsand continues to release n
ew or emergency Regulations, as necessary, to implement and regulate the Video Gaming Act.  Effective October 9, 2012, video gaming inIllinois became oper
ational.  The video gaming terminals in licensed establishments allow patrons to play games such as video poker, line up and blackjack.   In December 2015, 
over ,200 licensed establishmen ts were operating nearly 22,000 video gaming terminals.  Gr and Victoria’s revenues may be adversely impacted bythe availability of v
ideo gaming terminals in non-casino establishments proximately located to its customer base.

nancial and operating reports to the Macau gaming authorities and furnish any other information that the Macau gaming authoritiesmay require.  No person may acqu
ire any rights over the shares or assets of MGM Grand Paradise without first obtaining the approval of the Macau gamingauthorities.  The transf
er or creation of encumbrances over ownership of shares representing the share capital of MGM Grand Paradise or other rights relating to suchshares, and any act involving th
e granting of voting rights or other stockholders’ rights to persons or entities other than the original owners, would require theapproval of the Macau govern

ent shall not be subject to any liens or encumbrances, except under authorization by the Macau government. 
MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contr
act requires approval of the Macau government for transfers of shares, or of any rights over such shares, in any ofthe direct or indire
ct stockholders in MGM Grand Paradise, including us, provided that such shares or rights are directly or indirectly equivalent to an amount that isequal to or higher than 5% of 
the share capital in MGM Grand Paradise.  Under the subconcession contract, this approval requirement does not apply to securitiesthat are listed and t
radable on a stock market.  Since MGM Grand Paradise’s securities are not listed and tradable on a stock market this approval requirement appliesto transfers of MGM Grand Paradise
’s shares.  In addition, this contract requires that the Macau government be given notice of the creation of any encumbrance orthe grant of voting rights or o
ther stockholders’ rights to persons other than the original owners on shares in any of the direct or indirect stockholders in MGM GrandParadise, including us, provided th
at such shares or rights are indirectly equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5% of the share capital in MGMGrand Paradise.  This notice requ
irement will not apply, however, to securities listed and tradable on a stock exchange. 
MGM Grand Paradise is in no case allowed 
to delegate the management of gaming operations to a management company, and is in no case allowed to enterinto a management cont
ract by which its managing powers are or might be assumed by a third party.  Any act or contract by which MGM Grand Paradise assigns,transfers, alienat

e become aware of any fact that may be material to the appropriate qualification of any shareholder who owns 5% ormore of the share capi
tal, or any director or key employee.  Changes in approved corporate positions must be reported to the Macau gaming authorities.  The Macaugaming authorities have 
jurisdiction to deny an application for a finding of suitability. 
Any person who fails or refuses to apply 
for a finding of suitability after being ordered to do so by the Macau gaming authorities may be found unsuitable.  Anystockholder subject to a sui
tability process who is found unsuitable must transfer their shares to a third party within a term set by the Macau government.  If suchtransfer is not consumma
ted, MGM Grand Paradise must acquire those shares.  If any officer, director or key employee is found unsuitable, MGM Grand Paradisemust sever all rela

14

 person 
.   In case of failure to act in accordance thereof, MGM Grand Paradise would become subject to administrative sanctions and penalties.

ing stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control,to be considered suitable 
as part of the approval process of the transaction. 
The Macau gaming authorit
ies also have the power to supervise gaming operators in order to assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators andtheir affiliates.
 
The subconcession contract r
equires the Macau gaming authorities’ prior approval of any recapitalization plan, any increase of the capital stock by publicsubscription, any issue of pref
erential shares or any creation, issue or transformation of types or series of shares representative of MGM Grand Paradise capital stock,as well as any change in the cons
tituent documents (i.e., articles of association) of MGM Grand Paradise.  The Chief Executive of Macau could also require MGMGrand Paradise to increase 
its share capital if he deemed it necessary. 
MGM Macau was constructed and is oper
ated under MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract.  This subconcession excludes the following gamingactivities:  mutua
l bets, gaming activities provided to the public, interactive gaming and games of chance or other gaming, betting or gambling activities on ships orplanes.  MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession 
is exclusively governed by Macau law.  MGM Grand Paradise is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts ofMacau in case of any potent
ial dispute or conflict relating to our subconcession. 
MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contr
act expires on March 31, 2020.  Unless the subconcession is extended, on that date, all casino operations andrelated equipment in MGM Ma
cau will automatically be transferred to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise and MGM ResortsInternational will c
ease to generate any revenues from these operations.  Beginning on April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession bygiving MGM Grand Paradise at least on
e year prior notice and by paying fair compensation or indemnity. 
The amount of such compensation o
r indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption. 
The Macau government also has 
the right to unilaterally terminate, without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, the subconcession at any time upon theoccurrence of fundamen
tal non-compliance by MGM Grand Paradise with applicable Macau laws or MGM Grand Paradise’s basic obligations under thesubconcession contract.  If 
the default is curable, the Macau gaming authorities are required to give MGM Grand Paradise prior notice to cure the default, though nospecific cure period 
for that purpose is provided. 
The subconcession contract con
tains various general covenants and obligations and other provisions, the compliance with which is subjective.  MGM GrandParadise has the following oblig
ations under the subconcession contract: 
 
· ensure the proper operat ion and conduct of casino games; 
 
· employ people with appropria te qualifications; 
 
· operate and conduct casino g ames of chance in a fair and honest manner without the influence of criminal activities; and 
 
· safeguard and ensure Macau ’s interests in tax revenue from the operation of casinos and other gaming areas. 
The subconcession contract r
equires MGM Grand Paradise Limited to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance which are in place. 
MGM Grand Paradise Limited is also sub
ject to certain reporting requirements to the Macau gaming authorities. 
Under the subconcession, MGM Grand Paradise Li
mited is obligated to pay to the Macau S.A.R.  an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variableportion based on the number and typ
e of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated.  The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 million patacas(approximately $3.9 mil
lion, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2015).  The variable portion is equal to 300,000 patacas per gaming table reserved exclusivelyfor certain kinds of gam
es or players, 150,000 
15

 patacas per gaming tab
le not so reserved and 1,000 patacas per electrical or mechanical gaming machine, including slot machines (approximately $3 8 , 7 00 , $1 9 ,4 
00 and $12 9 , respectively, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2015 ), subject to a minimum o f forty five million patacas (approximately $5. 8  million,based on exchange rates at De

es .   It must also contribute 1.6% and 2.4% (a portion of which must be used for promotion of tourism in Macau) of its gross gamingrevenue to a public foundat
ion designated by the Macau S.A.R . government and to the Macau S.A.R, respectively, as special levy. 
Currently, the gaming tax in M
acau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue.  However, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions forcredit losses.  As a result, i
f MGM Grand Paradise issues markers to its customers in Macau and is unable to collect on the related receivables from them, it has topay taxes on its winnings from thes
e customers even though it was unable to collect the related receivables. 
MGM Grand Paradise has received a 
concession from the Macau government to use a 10.67 acre parcel of land for MGM Macau (the “MGM Macau LandContract”).  The land concess
ion will expire on April 6, 2031 and is renewable. 
The MGM Macau Land Contract requir
es MGM Grand Paradise to pay a premium which was paid in full before the opening of MGM Macau.  In addition,MGM Grand Paradise is also obligated 
to pay rent annually for the term of the MGM Macau Land Contract.  The rent amount may be revised every five years by theMacau government, accord
ing to the provisions of the Macau Land law. 
In addition, MGM Grand Paradise has re
ceived a concession from the Macau government to use an approximately 18 acre site in Cotai Macau and develop asecond resort and casino (th
e “Cotai Land Contract”).   The land concession contrac t became effective on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years.  Thetotal land premium pay
able to the Macau government for the land concession contract is $161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semi-annual payments.  As of December 31, 2015, MGM China h
ad paid $130 million of the contract premium.  In January 2016, MGM China paid the fourth semi-annual payment of $15 mill
ion under the land concession contract.  Including interest on the four remaining semi-annual payments, MGM China has $99 millionremaining payable for 
the land concession contract.  Under the terms of the land concession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is required to complete the developmentof the land by January 2018.
 
MGM Grand Paradise received an ex
emption from Macau’s corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for a periodof five-years start
ing at January 1, 2007.  In October 2011, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of this exemption for an additional five years.  Theexemption runs through Decembe
r 31, 2016.
Maryland
Government
Regulation
 
The Maryland State Lottery Vid
eo Lottery Terminal Law (“Maryland VLT Law”) subjects the owners and operators of video lottery facilities to extensive statelicensing and regulatory 
requirements.  We are subject to the Maryland VLT Law and the regulations promulgated to implement it through our ownership interest inMGM National Harbor, LLC, which is expected to op
erate a video lottery facility in Prince George’s County, Maryland, which facility is currently scheduled forcompletion in the fourth qu
arter of 2016 (the “National Harbor Proje ct”). 
Under the Maryland VLT Law, the Maryland Lo
ttery and Gaming Control Commission (“Maryland Commission”), in conjunction with the Maryland Lotteryand Gaming Control Agency (“Maryland Agen
cy”), maintains authority to regulate the operation of video lottery terminals and tables games within the State ofMaryland, and to issue video lot
tery operation licenses to qualified applicants.  The Maryland Video Lottery Facility Location Commission (“Maryland LocationCommission”) has the authori
ty to award up to six video lottery operation licenses within the State of Maryland and is responsible for evaluating competingproposals and awarding the video lo
ttery operation licenses to applicants based on business and market, economic development and location siting factors.  TheMaryland Location Commission c
annot award a video lottery operation license to an applicant until the Maryland Commission determines that the applicant isqualified.  On October 10, 2013, the Mary
land Commission determined that MGM National Harbor, LLC and all applicable principals were qualified, and onDecember 23, 2013, the Maryland Loc
ation Commission awarded the video lottery operation license in Prince George’s County, Maryland to MGM NationalHarbor, LLC.  MGM National Harbor, LLC was awarded the sixth 
and final video lottery operation license in Maryland. 
Once a video lottery opera
tion license is awarded, the Maryland Commission may issue the license if the, as developed, video lottery facility is consistent in allmaterial respec
ts with that proposed by the applicant to the Maryland Location Commission, meets applicable state and local requirements, for example, zoning, landuse, and transportatio
n approvals or permits, and the applicant continues to meet qualification and other regulatory requirements. 
 
16

 Once the video lottery
 operation license is issued, the initial license term of 15 years will commence .   The initial license fee is based on the number of videolottery terminals p
roposed within the video lottery facility .   As 3,600 video lottery terminals were proposed for the National Harbor Project, our initial license feewas $21 million, and the Maryland Lo
cation Commission determined that the National Harbor Project may have up to 3,600 terminals .   Within 1 year of the end ofthe initial 15–year l
icense term, a video lottery operation licensee may reapply for a license that has a license term of 10 years and a license fee to be established bystatute.
 
Under the Maryland VLT Law, video lotte
ry terminals each must have an average payout percentage of at least 87%.  Video lottery facilities are permitted tooperate 24 hours a day, and patrons 
must be 21 years of age to wager.  While alcohol may be offered in the video lottery facility, it may not be offered free ofcharge.  The Maryland VLT Law and regul
ations also impose various restrictions on check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and other transactions withinthe video lottery facility.
 
The Maryland Commission has extens
ive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants for a video lottery operationlicense, affilia
ted holding or intermediary companies, directors, officers, key management employees, principals, partners, and other persons or entities holding a fivepercent or greater 
interest in the applicant, are qualified under the Maryland VLT Law. 
The Maryland VLT Law provides that inst
itutional investors may be exempt from certain regulatory requirements, and an Institutional Investor WaiverApplication may be submitt
ed for entities holding an interest in an applicant or licensee that are considered institutional investors.  The term “institutional investor”generally includes insur
ance companies, banks and financial institutions, investment companies, trusts and advisors, pension funds, etc.  The MarylandCommission’s decision concern
ing whether to grant a waiver is discretionary, and based on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the institutionalinvestor’s securities, whe
ther the investor is substantially involved in the video lottery operations of the licensee, and the investor’s gaming licensure history in otherjurisdictions.
 
After a video lottery ope
ration license is awarded and/or issued, the Maryland Commission has responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of thelicensee and its offi
cers, directors, and other designated persons.  The Maryland Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or restrict a video lotteryoperation license, and m
ay levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations.  The licensee’s participation in video lottery and table game operations isexpressly deemed a revoc
able privilege under the Maryland VLT Law, conditioned on the proper and continued qualification of the licensee and the licensee meetingreporting requiremen
ts and continuing to provide any assistance and information necessary to the Maryland regulators.  Each licensee has an affirmativeresponsibility to provide an 
annual update of applicable licensing information to the Maryland Commission.  Among other things, the Maryland Commission is alsoresponsible for the coll
ection of application, license and other fees, conducting investigations into the operation of video lottery terminals and table games, andreviewing and ruling on compla
ints, and may conduct unannounced inspections of the video lottery facility premises or the licensee’s records and equipment. 
The regulations promulgat
ed to implement the Maryland VLT Law impose detailed substantive and procedural requirements related to video lottery licensingand ongoing operations.  The regula
tions include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning:  licensing investigations and hearings; marketing controls andstandards; internal con
trol standards related to accounting, finance and statistics, audits, record retention, complimentaries, surveillance, security, cage and customertransactions, promotions, and o
ther gaming related controls; facility design standards; table games surveillance; gaming floor plans; the transportation and testing ofvideo lottery terminals and
 table games equipment; the registration of video lottery terminals and table games; voluntary and mandatory patron exclusion;responsible gaming; and junke
t enterprises and representatives.  Applicants and licensees must also meet requirements concerning minority business participation,provide health insurance
 and retirement benefits for employees, and give preference to hiring employees located within ten miles of the video lottery facility. 
Generally, a video lotte
ry operation license may not be transferred, assigned or pledged as collateral without approval from the MarylandCommission.  Specifically, a 
licensee cannot sell or transfer more than 5% of the legal or beneficial interests in the licensee unless the Maryland Commission isnotified and determines that
 the buyer or transferee meets all applicable qualification and regulatory requirements.  If the licensee fails to meet these requirements,the applicable lic
ense will be automatically revoked ninety days after the transfer or sale.  Entities and individuals are also prohibited from owning an interest inmore than one video lotte
ry facility, and any application to the Maryland Location Commission to apply for an additional license must include a plan for divestingthe applicable inte
rest in the initial license.  Applicants seeking investors in an entity applying for a video lottery operation license must make serious, good-faithefforts to solicit and 
interview a reasonable number of minority investors before a license will be awarded by the Maryland Location Commission, and following theaward, must again make ser
ious, good-faith efforts to interview minority investors in any future attempts to raise venture capital or attract new investors to the entityawarded the license.
 
The Maryland Commission reta
ins the authority to recommend or propose changes to the Maryland VLT Law, and may amend or change regulationsconcerning the Maryland VLT Law, which, i
f enacted, could adversely affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Maryland.

New
Jersey
Government
Regulation
 
Our ownership of 50% of Borgata in Atlant
ic City, New Jersey subjects us to extensive state regulation under the New Jersey Casino Control Act and theregulations promulgated 
thereunder (collectively, the “NJ Act”) and various other statutes and regulations.  The New Jersey Casino Control Commission (“NJCommission”) and the New Jersey Division o
f Gaming Enforcement (“NJ Division” and, together with the NJ Commission, the “NJ Gaming Authorities”) are, tovarying degrees, empowered to 
regulate a wide spectrum of gaming and non-gaming related activities and to approve the form of ownership and financial structureof not only a casino license
e, but also its holding and intermediary companies and entity qualifiers. 
The NJ Commission issues casino licens
es and casino key employee licenses and the NJ Division issues all other types of licenses, including permits to conductintrastate Intern
et gaming and registrations and licenses to persons who provide goods or services to a casino.  The NJ Division also is responsible for investigatingall license applic
ations and for monitoring compliance with and enforcing the requirements of the NJ Act. 
On June 24, 2010, the NJ Commission renewed Borgata’s c
asino license effective July 1, 2010 for a term which became indefinite by operation oflaw.  However, no later than five y
ears after the issuance of a casino license, and approximately every five years thereafter, the casino licensee and its qualifyingentities and individuals 
must submit information to the NJ Gaming Authorities to demonstrate their continuing qualification.  In addition, the NJ Commission mayreopen the license hea
ring at any time, and the NJ Commission must do so at the request of the NJ Division.  In September 2014, we and certain of our subsidiarieswere found qualified as holding 
companies of Borgata, the trust holding our interest in Borgata was dissolved, and all of the trust property assets, including $83million of cash, were tr
ansferred to us. 
Pursuant to the NJ Act and applicabl
e precedent, no entity may hold a casino license unless each officer, director, person who directly or indirectly holds anybeneficial inter
est or ownership of the securities of the licensee, each person who in the opinion of the Director of the NJ Division has the ability to control or elect amajority of the board of d
irectors of the licensee (other than a banking or other licensed lending institution acting in the ordinary course of business) and each of itsholding, intermediary or subs
idiary companies, obtains and maintains qualification approval from the NJ Gaming Authorities. 
Persons holding 5% or more of the equ
ity securities of a holding or intermediary company are presumed to have the ability to control the company or elect oneor more of its directo
rs and will, unless this presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence or the qualification requirement is waived, be required toindividually qualify.  Equity s
ecurities are defined in the NJ Act as any voting stock or any other security having a direct or indirect participation in the profits of theissuer.  Notwithstanding either 
the presumption of control for holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding company or the requirement that a casinolicensee establish and 
maintain the qualification of certain holders of debt securities, the NJ Act provides for a waiver of qualification for passive “institutionalinvestors,” as defined by the NJ Act und
er certain circumstances. 
Casino licensees are also 
required to establish and maintain the qualifications of any financial backer, investor, mortgagee, bondholder, or holder of indentures,notes or other evidences of 
indebtedness, either in effect or proposed which bears any relation to the casino operation or casino hotel premises who holds 25% ormore of such financial 
instruments or other evidences of indebtedness; provided, however, in circumstances of default, persons holding 10% of such financialinstruments or evidences o
f indebtedness shall be required to establish and maintain their qualifications.  Persons who hold less than these thresholds may berequired to establish and 
maintain their qualifications in the discretion of the Director of the NJ Division.  Banks and licensed lending institutions, however, areexempt from any qualif
ication requirements if they are acting in the ordinary course of business. 
The NJ Act imposes certain res
trictions upon the issuance, ownership and transfer of securities of a casino licensee and its holding and intermediary companies anddefines the term “security” to
 include instruments which evidence a direct or indirect beneficial ownership or creditor interest, including stock (common andpreferred) mortgag
es, debentures, security agreements, notes, warrants, options and rights.  If the NJ Commission finds that a holder of such securities is notqualified under the NJ Act, it h
as the right to take any remedial action deemed appropriate including the right to force divestiture by such disqualified holder of suchsecurities.  In the even
t that certain disqualified holders fail to divest themselves of such securities, the NJ Commission has the power to revoke or suspend the casinolicense or licenses r
elated to the company which issued the securities.  It is unlawful for a disqualified holder (i) to exercise, directly or through any trustee ornominee, any right confer
red by such securities or (ii) to receive any dividends or interest upon such securities or any remuneration, in any form, from its affiliatedcasino licensee for services
 rendered or otherwise. 
The NJ Act requires our certi
ficate of incorporation to provide that our securities are held subject to the condition that if a holder is found to be disqualified bythe NJ Commission pursuant to the NJ Act, such hold
er shall dispose of his interest in the company.  Accordingly, our certificate of incorporation provides that aholder of our securities 
must dispose of such securities if the holder is 
18

 found disqualified under the NJ Act 
.   In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we may redeem the stock of any holder found to be disqualified. 
The ability of a lender 
to foreclose on pledged assets, including gaming equipment, is subject to compliance with the NJ Act.  Generally, no person is permittedto hold an ownership interest in o
r manage a casino or own any gaming assets, including gaming devices, without being licensed.  Consequently, any lender whodesires to enforce a se
curity interest must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either be found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtaininterim casino author
ization (“ICA”) prior to obtaining any ownership interest.  Similarly, any prospective purchaser of an ownership interest in a casino or ofgaming assets must file 
the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtain ICA prior to obtainingany ownership interest or gam
ing assets.
Massachusetts
Government
Regulation
 
The Massachusetts Expanded Gaming Act 
(“Massachusetts Act”) subjects the owners and operators of gaming establishments to extensive state licensing andregulatory requirem
ents.  We are subject to the Massachusetts Act and the regulations promulgated to implement it through our ownership interest in Blue TarpreDevelopment, LLC (“Blue Tarp”
), which is expected to operate a gaming establishment in Springfield, Massachusetts, which establishment is currently scheduledfor completion and opening in 2017.  
 
Under the Massachusetts Act, the M
assachusetts Gaming Commission (“Massachusetts Commission”) is responsible for issuing licenses under theMassachusetts Act and assuring th
at licenses are not issued or held by unqualified, disqualified or unsuitable persons.  The Investigations and Enforcement Bureau(“IEB”), which is a Bureau within th
e Massachusetts Commission, is responsible for conducting administrative investigations of applicants and licensees, and forgenerally enforcing th
e Massachusetts Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  In order to enforce the law, the IEB coordinates with the Massachusetts StatePolice, Attorney General and th
e Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission in order to perform its duties.  The Massachusetts Act also establishes a GamingEnforcement Division within th
e Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office responsible for investigating and prosecuting criminal violations of the MassachusettsAct.  The Massachusetts Commission has 
the authority to award up to three Category 1 licenses (table games and slot machines), and one Category 2 license (slotmachines only), within the Commonwe
alth of Massachusetts to qualified applicants.   
On December 23, 2013, the Massachusetts Com
mission determined that Blue Tarp and all applicable principal individuals and entities were qualified, and onNovember 6, 2014, the Massachusetts Comm
ission awarded the sole Category 1 license in Region B of Massachusetts to Blue Tarp, effective November 7, 2014.   
While a Category 1 licens
e has been awarded to Blue Tarp, Blue Tarp may not conduct gaming activities until an operations certificate has been issued by theMassachusetts Commission, which will b
e issued upon compliance with applicable provisions of the Massachusetts Act and regulations promulgated thereunder,receipt of all requ
ired permits and approvals, compliance with the conditions of Blue Tarp’s Category 1 license, and Blue Tarp continuing to meet applicablelicensing, registrat
ion, qualification and other regulatory requirements.  Under the Massachusetts Act, a Category 1 gaming licensee who fails to commenceoperations within one year f
rom the opening date approved by the Massachusetts Commission is subject to the suspension or revocation of its license and, if theCommission determines tha
t the gaming licensee acted in bad faith in its application, be assessed a fine of $50,000,000 or less.  Under Blue Tarp’s Host CommunityAgreement with the City of Springf
ield, Blue Tarp’s failure to commence operations by February 7, 2018 subjects Blue Tarp to potential liquidated damages in theamount of $64,393.28 per calendar d
ay. An amendment to the Host Community Agreement negotiated with the City of Springfield to extend this date is pendingbefore the Springfield City Counc
il.   
The initial license 
term is 15 years, which will commence upon the Massachusetts Commission’s approval of the commencement of the operation of the gamingestablishment.  The init
ial license fee for Category 1 licenses is $85,000,000, as determined by the Massachusetts Commission and authorized by the MassachusettsAct, which amount Blue Tarp has paid.  All Ca
tegory 1 and Category 2 gaming licensees are also subject to additional annual fees under the MassachusettsAct.  Category 1 licensees must g
enerally make on-going annual capital expenditures to their gaming establishments in a minimum aggregate amount equal to 3.5percent of the net gam
ing revenues derived from the establishment. 
Under the Massachusetts Act, gam
ing establishments may be open 24 hours a day, patrons must be 21 years of age to wager.  Gaming beverage licenses may begranted by the Massachusetts Com
mission for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages at the gaming establishment except between the hours of 2 a.m.  and 8a.m..  The Massachusetts Act and r
egulations also describe procedures for, and restrictions on, check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and othertransactions within the ga
ming establishment.  Certain regulations related to these transactions and other casino internal controls are currently in draft form, andsubject to further rev
iew, revision and final approval.   
 
19

 The Massachusetts Commission, in pa
rticular the IEB, has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants forCategory 1 and Category 2 licenses, 
affiliated holding or intermediary companies, subsidiaries, directors, managers, officers, financiers and debt holders, associates,key gaming executives and e
mployees, other gaming related employees, and other persons or entities holding a five percent or greater direct or indirect interest in theapplicant, are quali
fied under the Massachusetts Act (with certain exemptions for institutional investors in the discretion of the Massachusetts Commission) .   
After a Category 1 license 
is awarded, the Massachusetts Commission and IEB have responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the licenseeand its officers, dire
ctors, employees and other designated persons.  The Massachusetts Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or condition a Category1 license, or any other li
cense issued under the Massachusetts Act, and the IEB may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations.  All licenses issued underthe Massachusetts Act are 
expressly deemed a revocable privilege, conditioned on the licensee’s fulfillment of all conditions of licensure, compliance with applicablelaws and regulations, and the l
icensee’s continuing qualification and suitability.  Among other things, the Massachusetts Commission is also responsible for thecollection of applic
ation, license and other fees, conducting investigations of and monitoring applicants and licensees, and reviewing and ruling on complaints, andmay conduct inspections of th
e gaming establishment premises or the licensee’s records and equipment.   
The regulations promulgat
ed to implement the Massachusetts Act impose detailed substantive and procedural requirements related to licensing and on-goingoperations.  The regulations 
include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning: licensing and registration of employees; accounting procedures and internalcontrols; surveillanc
e and security requirements; gaming equipment, devices and systems, and device registration and testing; self-exclusion; on-going reportingrequirements related to constr
uction, approvals and operations; temporary licensure; marketing and affirmative marketing plans; notification requirements related tonew or changes in shareholders, ex
ecutives, and other qualifiers; notification and/or approval of certain material events and transactions; complimentary services; on-going capital expenditur
es; political contributions; credit issuance and customer transactions; auditing and record retention; facility design and gaming floor plans;slot machine possession and tr
ansportation; table game rules and procedures; employee credentials; vendors and junkets; and count room and cage procedures. 
Generally, interests in 
a gaming establishment and Category 1 licenses may not be transferred without notification to and approval of the MassachusettsCommission.  The sale, assignment, 
transfer, pledge or other disposition of any security issued by a corporation which holds a gaming license is conditional and willbe ineffective if d
isapproved by the Massachusetts Commission.  Category 1 licensees may also not change their business governing structure without thenotification and approva
l of the Massachusetts Commission, and may not operate, invest in or own, in whole or in part, another gaming licensee’s license or gamingestablishment.
 
The Massachusetts Commission re
tains the authority to promulgate, amend or repeal regulations concerning the Massachusetts Act, which, if enacted, couldadversely affect th
e gaming industry and our ability to operate in Massachusetts.  Further, certain regulations are currently in draft form, and subject to furtherreview, revision and final 
approval.

NDEPENDENT
AUDITORS’
REPORT 
To the Board of Directors
CityCenter Holdings, LLC
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of CityCenter Holding
s, LLC and its subsidiaries (the “Company”), which comprise theconsolidated
 balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, members’ equity, and cash flows for each ofthe three years in the p

Management’s
Responsibility
for
the
Consolidated
Financial
Stat
ements 
Management
 is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  accounting  principlesgenerally
 accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fairpresentation of consoli
dated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Auditors’
Responsibility
 
Our
 responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  withauditing
 standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether the co
nsolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
An audit
 involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The proceduresselected
 depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due tofraud
 or  error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  Company’s  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  theconsolidated
 financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion onthe
 effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accountingpolicies
 used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidatedfinancial statements.
 
We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion
 
In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CityCenter Holdings,LLC
 and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31, 2015, in accordanc
e with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

measurements.
Fair  value measurements affect the Company’s accounting for and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, residentialreal-estate, res
idential mortgage notes and intangible assets. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in anorderly transaction be
tween market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy consisting of: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted pricesin an active market
; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. 
5

 When assessing fair
 value of its residential real estate, the Company estimates fair value less costs to sell utilizing Level 3 inputs, including a discounted cashflow analysis based on managem
ent’s current expectations of future cash flows. See Note 4 for further discussion. 
The
 Company valued its residential mortgage notes using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 3 inputs, including contractual cash flows anddiscount
 rates based on market indicators. The Company sold its residential mortgage note portfolio in 2013. See “Residential mortgage notes” below for furtherdiscussion.
 
Cash

and
cash
equivalents.
Cash  and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at thedate of acquisition. Such inves
tments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 
Restricted
cash.
As of December 31, 2014, restrict ed cash included $58 million in condo proceeds contractually restricted to use for payment on constructionrelated
 liens, which were subsequently used to fund amounts due to Perini Building Company (“Perini”) pursuant to the settlement agreements, and $85 million ofrestricted
 cash related to insurance proceeds received in connection with certain settlement agreements, discussed in Note 11. Under the terms of the agreementsapplicable
 to CityCenter, such proceeds were being held in a segregated account and were payable by the Company to MGM Resorts. During 2015 such restrictionswere removed in accordan
ce with these agreements.  See Notes 11 and 13 for further discussion. 
Accounts

receivable
and
credit
risk.
The  Company  issues  markers  to  approved  casino  customers  following  investigations  of  creditworthiness.  As  ofDecember
 31,  2015,  approximately  73%  of  the  Company’s  casino  receivables  were  due  from  customers  residing  in  foreign  countries.  Business  or  economicconditions or other 
significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables. 
Trade
 receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off whenmanagement deems the account
 to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An allowance for doubtful accounts ismaintained to
 reduce the Company’s receivables to their estimated realizable amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on a specificreview of
 customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31,2015, no significant concentr
ations of credit risk existed. 
Inventories.
Inventories consist primarily  of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costis determined prima
rily by the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost method. 
Residential
real
estate.
Residential real  estate represents capitalized costs of residential inventory, which consists of completed condominium units availablefor
 sale  less  impairments  previously  recognized.  Costs  include  land,  direct  and  indirect  construction  and  development  costs,  and  capitalized  property  taxes  andinterest. See Note 4 for fur
ther discussion of residential real estate. 
As
 part of an increase in the Company’s construction accrual during 2013, the Company recognized an increased cost of its residential inventory of $20million,
 $14  million  of  which  was  recorded  to  “Property  transactions,  net”  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2013,  representing  additional  costs  associated  withpreviously sold residentia
l units. 
Residential
 operating  expenses  include  cost of real  estate  sold, holding costs, selling  costs,  indirect  selling  costs and valuation  allowances  for residentialmortgage
 notes receivable. Costs associated with residential sales were deferred during construction, except for indirect selling costs and general and administrativeexpense, which were expensed as incu
rred. 
Property
and
equipment.
Property and  equipment are stated at cost including capitalized interest. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipmentare
 included in the determination of income or loss. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its lifeare charged to expense as 
incurred. Property and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis: 
Buildings and improvements
   20 to 40 years   Land improvements
   10 to 20 years   Furniture and fixtures
   3 to 20 years   Equipment
   3 to 20 years    
Project
 costs are stated at cost and recorded as property and equipment (which includes adjustments made upon the initial contribution by MGM Resorts)unless
 determined to be impaired, in which case the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value. Final costs of the initial project were determined in connectionwith
 settlement of Perini litigation in December 2014 as discussed in Note 11. The Company recorded non-operating expense related to the Perini settlement of $8million and $37 million fo
r statutory6

 interest
 on estimated amounts payable in 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the Company accrued $139 million payable to Perini related to thesettlement agreement.
 
In
 December 2015, the Company decided to close the Zarkana show at the Aria Resort & Casino as part of a plan to expand its conference and conventionspace.
 The  Company  expects  the  majority  of  the  assets  related  to  the  Zarkana  theatre  will  be  disposed  in  April  2016  with  construction  of  the  conference  andconvention
 space to begin in May 2016.  As a result, the Company has shortened the useful life of the assets related to the Zarkana theatre and recognized $20million in accelerated depreciation expense associated with such assets in 2015. Accelerate
d depreciation expense of $20 million will be recognized each month untilthe theatre’s disposit
ion in April 2016.     
Impairment

of
long-lived
assets.
The  Company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment as held and used. The Company reviews assets to beheld and used
 for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. It then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to thecarrying
 amount of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed thecarrying amount, then imp
airment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. 
Intangible
assets.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual i
mpairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. See Note 6 for further discussion. 
Debt
issuance
costs
.  The Company capitalizes debt issuance costs, which include legal and other direct costs related to the issuance of debt. The capitalizedcosts
 are amortized straight-line to interest expense over the contractual term of the debt. The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)Accounting
 Standards Update No. 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” (“ASU 2015-03”), in 2015 on a retrospective basis as furtherdiscussed in the “Recently issued
 accounting standards” section. Accordingly, a reclassification has been made to the prior year financial statements to reclassify $13million from Deposits and oth
er assets, net, to Long-term debt, net as of December 31, 2014.
Revenue

recognition
and
promotional
allowances.
Casino  revenue  is  the  aggregate  net  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses,  with  liabilitiesrecognized for
 funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the customers’ possession (“casino outstanding chipliability”).
 Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and goods are provided. Advancedeposits on rooms and advance ti
cket sales are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the customer. 
Gaming
 revenues  are  recognized  net  of  certain  sales  incentives,  including  discounts  and  points  earned  in  point-loyalty  programs.  The  retail  value  ofaccommodations,
 food  and  beverage,  and  other  services  furnished  to  guests  without  charge  is  included  in  gross  revenue  and  then  deducted  as  promotionalallowances. The estimat
ed cost of providing such promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

sales
–
revenue
recognition.
Revenue  for residential sales is deferred until closing occurs, which is when title, possession and other attributes ofownership
 have been transferred to the buyer and the Company is not obligated to perform activities after the sale. Additionally, the buyer’s initial and continuinginvestment must be adequa
te to demonstrate a commitment to pay and the buyer’s receivable cannot be subject to future subordination. 
Leases

where
the
Company
is
a
lessor.
The  majority of the Company’s revenue from leasing activities  relates to Crystals. Minimum rental revenue, ifapplicable to the le
ase, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Revenue from contingent rent is recognized as earned. The Companyprovides
 construction allowances to certain tenants. Construction allowances are recorded as fixed assets if the Company has determined it is the owner of suchimprovements for
 accounting purposes; improvements related specifically to the current tenant are depreciated over the shorter of the asset life or lease term.  Wherethe
 Company has determined it is not the owner of such improvements, the construction allowances are amortized over the life of the related lease as a reduction ofrevenue.

 Loyalty

programs.
Aria  participates in the MGM Resorts’ “M life” loyalty program. Customers may earn points and/or Express Comps for their gamingplay
 which  can  be  redeemed  at  restaurants,  box  offices  or  the  M  life  front  desk  at  participating  properties.  Points  may  also  be  redeemed  for  free  slot  play  onparticipating machines. The Company records a liability based on
 the points earned multiplied by the redemption value, less an estimate for points not expected to beredeemed,
 and records a corresponding reduction in casino revenue. Customers also earn Express Comps based on their gaming play which can be redeemed forcomplimentary
 goods  and  services,  including  hotel  rooms,  food  and  beverage,  and  entertainment.  The  Company  records  a  liability  for  the  estimated  costs  ofproviding
 goods and services for Express Comps based on the Express Comps earned multiplied by a cost margin, less an estimate for Express Comps not expectedto be redeemed and reco
rds a corresponding expense in the casino department. 
Preopening

and
start-up
expenses.
Costs  incurred for one-time activities during the start-up phase of operations are accounted for as preopening and start-up
 costs.  Preopening  and  start-up  costs,  including  organizational  costs,  are  expensed  as  incurred.  No  preopening  expenses  were  incurred  for  the  periods  endedDecember 31, 2015 and 2014. Durin
g 2013, costs classified as preopening and start-up expense represent costs associated with the opening of a new wedding chapel. 
Advertising.
The  Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense is included in preopening and start-upexpenses
 when related to the preopening and start-up period and in general and administrative expense when related to ongoing operations or residential sellingexpenses. Advertising expense was $20 mi
llion for the each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 
Property

transactions,
net.
The  Company classifies transactions related to long-lived assets – such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, andgains and losses on the sale of f
ixed assets – within “Property transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 9 for details.
Residential
mortgage
notes.
Certain  buyers of CityCenter’s residential units participated in the Company’s seller financing program, whereby the Companyprovided
 first  mortgage  financing.  All  mortgage  notes  were  classified  as  held  for  sale  and  reported  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value,  determined  based  onmanagement’s
 assessment of the market terms of the portfolio and its collectability. The evaluation of collectability was based on several factors including pastpayment
 history, duration of the loan, creditworthiness, loan-to-value ratios, underlying collateral, and present economic conditions. The entire residential mortgagenote receivable port
folio was sold in April 2013. 
Income

taxes.
The  Company  is  treated  as  a  partnership  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  Therefore,  federal  income  taxes  are  the  responsibility  of  theMembers. As a result, no provision fo
r income taxes is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Comprehensive
income
(loss).
Net income (loss) equals co mprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented.Dividends.
In  April 2015, the Company adopted an annual distribution policy and declared and paid a special dividend of $400 million. Under the annualdistribution policy, the Company wi
ll distribute up to 35% of excess cash flow, subject to the approval of the Company’s board of directors.Recently

issued
accounting
standards.
On  February 25, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” (“ASU2016-02”),
 which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 840, Leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periodswithin
 those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leasesas
 finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a correspondinglease
 liability. For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognizea
 straight-line total lease expense. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statementsand footnote disclosures.
 
In
 August  2015,  the  FASB  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  No.  2015-14,  “Revenue  From  Contracts  With  Customers  (Topic  606):  Deferral  of  theEffective Date,”
 which defers the effective date of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers,” (“ASU 2014-09”) to thefiscal
 year, and interim periods within the year, beginning on or after December 15, 2017. FASB ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model forentities to use in accoun
ting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specificguidance.
 This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. Additionally, the new model willrequire
 revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects toreceive in
 exchange for those goods or services. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financialstatements and footnote d
isclosures.8

  
In
 July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,” (“ASU 2015-11”), effective forfiscal
 years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2015-11 requires inventory that is measured using first-in,first-out
 (FIFO) or average cost method to be measured “at the lower of cost and net realizable value,” thereby simplifying the current guidance under which anentity
 must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures). ASU No. 2015-11 will not applyto
 inventories that are measured by using either the LIFO method or the retail inventory method. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption ofASU 2015-11 will have on its consolidated fin
ancial statements and footnote disclosures. 
During 2015, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-03, which requ
ires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from thecarrying
 value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. The amortization of such costs will continue to be reported asinterest
 expense. In addition, in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, “Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance CostsAssociated with
 Line-of-Credit Arrangements: Amendments to SEC Paragraph Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting,” (“ASU 2015-15”),which
 was adopted concurrent with ASU 2015-03, the Company will continue to present the debt issuance costs associated with the Company's revolving creditfacilities
 as  other  assets  included  within  the  Company's  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  continue  amortizing  those  deferred  costs  over  the  term  of  the  relatedfacilities.
 ASU  2015-03  requires  the  new  guidance  to  be  applied  on  a  retrospective  basis.  Accordingly,  as  of  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  the  Companyreclassified $11 mil
lion and $13 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
Subsequent
events.
Management has evaluat ed subsequent events through February 26, 2016, the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.

REAL
ESTATE
 
Residential
 real estate was $2 million and $17 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, an additional $7 millionwas recorded
 in property and equipment, net related to a portion of the residential inventory in the rental program. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014and
 2013, the Company transferred $7 million, $43 million, and $16 million, respectively, of net residential real estate assets from property and equipment, netrelated to a portion of 
the units that were previously included in the rental program. 
The Company is required to carry its
 residential inventory at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. When assessing impairment of its residential realestate,
 the  Company  estimates  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  utilizing  Level  3  inputs,  including  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  based  on  management’s  currentexpectations of future
 cash flows. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and are highly sensitive to changes in the market and economic conditions.No impairment charges wer
e recorded against the Company’s residential inventory for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had one unit

 trademarks, domain names, and other intellectual property including the CityCenter, 
Aria,
Vdara
and Crystals
tradenames and Aria.com
 domain. There is no contractual or market-base
d limit to the use of these intangible assets and therefore they have been classified as indefinite-lived. 
The
 Company performs an annual review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter each year. The asset’s fair value iscompared to
 its carrying value, and an impairment charge is recorded for any short-fall. Fair value is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method which discountscash
 flows that would be required to obtain the use of the related intangible asset. Key inputs in the relief-from-royalty analysis include forecasted revenues relatedto the intangible asset, 
market royalty rates, discount rates and terminal year growth rates. 
The
 aircraft time sharing agreement intangible asset relates to an agreement between MGM Resorts and the Company whereby MGM Resorts provides theCompany
 the use of MGM Resorts’ aircraft in its operations. The Company is charged a rate that is based on Federal Aviation Administration regulations, whichprovides for reimbursement
 for specific costs incurred by MGM Resorts without any profit or mark-up. Accordingly, the fair value of this agreement was recognizedas an intangible asset, and 
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years, and will be fully amortized in 2029.

Senior

secured
credit
facility.
At  December 31, 2015, the Company’s senior secured credit facility consisted of a $75 million revolving facility maturing inOctober
 2018, and a $1.5 billion term loan B facility maturing in October 2020. The term loan B facility requires the Company to make amortization payments of0.25%
 of the original principal balance at each quarter end. In June 2014 the Company completed a repricing of the term loan B facility and used available cash topermanently repay $150
 million of the term loan B facility, a portion of which represents the amortization obligation through the remaining term of the facility. 
The loans under the term lo
an B bear interest, in the case of Eurodollar loans, at LIBOR plus 3.25% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and in the case of base rateloans,
 at the base rate plus 2.25%. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate on the term loan B was 4.25%. Loans under the revolving facility bear interest, in thecase of
 Eurodollar loans, at LIBOR plus 3.75% or 4.00%, depending on the Company’s credit ratings, and in the case of base rate loans, 2.75% or 3.00%, dependingon the Company’s ratings. Additional
ly, the Company pays an applicable fee of 0.375% or 0.50%, depending on the Company’s credit ratings, for the unused portionof the revolving facil
ity. The Company had $63 million of available borrowing capacity under its senior secured credit facility at December 31, 2015. 
11

 In
 connection with the closing of the senior secured credit facility in October 2013, the Company redeemed its existing 7.625% senior secured first lien notesand
 10.75% senior secured second lien PIK toggle notes at a premium in accordance with the terms of the indentures governing those notes. As a result of thetransaction,
 the Company recorded a loss on retirement of long-term debt of $140 million, primarily consisting of premiums associated with the redemption of theexisting
 first and second lien notes as well as the write-off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs. In connection with the October 2013 debt restructuring,sponsor
 notes with a carrying value of approximately $738 million were converted to Members’ equity. As a result of these transactions, the senior secured creditfacility is CityCenter
’s only remaining long-term debt. 
The
 senior  secured  credit  facility  is  a  general  senior  obligation  of  the  Company  and  ranks  equally  with  the  Company’s  other  existing  and  future  seniorobligations,
 is  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  on  a  senior  secured  basis  by  the  restricted  subsidiaries  of  the  Company,  and  is  secured  by  a  first-priorityperfected lien on substan
tially all of the Company’s assets and the assets of its subsidiaries. 
The
 senior secured credit facility contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to (i) incur additional indebtedness or liens,(ii)
 pay dividends or make distributions on its equity interests or repurchase its equity interests, (iii) make certain investments, (iv) enter into certain burdensomeagreements
 limiting the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to it, (v) sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies, and(vi)

SEGMENT
INFORMATION
 
The
 Company determines its segments based on the nature of the products and services provided. There are six operating segments: Aria, Vdara, MandarinOriental
 hotel, Crystals, Mandarin Oriental residential and Veer residential. Mandarin Oriental has both a hotel and a residential operating segment. The Companyhas aggregated
 residential operations into one reportable segment (“Residential”) given the similar economic characteristics and business of selling and leasing high-rise
 condominiums. All other operating segments are reported separately. The Company’s operating segments do not include the ongoing activity associated withclosing out its con
struction costs and certain corporate administrative costs. 
The
 Company analyzes the results of its operating segments’ operations based on Adjusted EBITDA, which it defines as earnings before interest and othernon-operating
 income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  preopening  and  start-up  expenses,  and  property  transactions,  net.  The  Company  believesAdjusted
 EBITDA is 1) a widely used measure of operating performance in the hospitality and gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of hospitalityand gaming companies.
 
While
 items  excluded  from  Adjusted  EBITDA  may  be  recurring  in  nature  and  should  not  be  disregarded  in  evaluating  the  Company’s  or  its  segments’earnings
 performance,  it  is  useful  to  exclude  such  items  when  analyzing  current  results  and  trends  compared  to  other  periods  because  these  items  can  varysignificantly
 depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, the Company believesexcluded
 items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, write-downs and impairments includes normalrecurring
 disposals  and  gains  and  losses  on  sales  of  assets  related  to  specific  assets  within  CityCenter,  but  also  includes  impairment  charges  which  may  not  becomparable period over p
eriod.

MITMENTS
AND
CONTINGENCIES 
Construction
litigation.
In March 2010, Perini,  general contractor for CityCenter, filed a lawsuit in the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark County, Stateof
 Nevada, against MGM MIRAGE Design Group (a wholly owned subsidiary of MGM Resorts which was the original party to the Perini construction agreement)and certain direct
 or indirect subsidiaries of the Company. Perini asserted, among other things, that CityCenter was substantially completed, but the defendants failedto pay Perini approximate
ly $490 million allegedly due and owing under the construction agreement for labor, equipment and materials expended on CityCenter. 
In
 April 2010, Perini served an amended complaint in this case which joined as defendants many owners of CityCenter residential condominium units (the“Condo
 Owner  Defendants”),  added  a  count  for  foreclosure  of  Perini's  recorded  master  mechanic’s  lien  against  the  CityCenter  property  in  the  amount  ofapproximately
 $491 million, and asserted the priority of this mechanic’s lien over the interests of the Company, the Condo Owner Defendants and the Company’slenders
 in the CityCenter property.  In November 2012, Perini filed a second amended complaint which, among other things, added claims against the CityCenterdefendants
 of breach of contract (alleging that CityCenter’s Owner Controlled Insurance Program (“OCIP”) failed to provide adequate project insurance for Periniwith
 broad coverages and high limits), and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (alleging improper administration by the Companyof
 the  OCIP  and  Builders  Risk  insurance  programs).  Prior  to  the  Final  Settlement,  as  defined  below,  the  Company  settled  the  claims  of  219  first-tier  Perinisubcontractors
 (including the claims of any lower-tier subcontractors that might have claims through those first-tier subcontractors). As a result of these settlementagreements
 and the prior settlement agreements between Perini and the Company, most but not all of the components of Perini’s non-Harmon-related lien claimagainst
 the Company were resolved. On February 24, 2014, Perini filed a revised lien for $174 million as the amount claimed by Perini and the remaining Harmon-related subcontractors.
 
During
 2013, the Company reached a settlement agreement with certain professional service providers against whom it had asserted claims in this litigationfor
 errors or omissions with respect to the CityCenter project, and relevant insurers.  This settlement was approved by the court and the Company received proceedsof $38 million in 2014 relat
ed to both the Harmon and other components of the CityCenter project. 
In
 2014, the Company reached a settlement with builder’s risk insurers of a claim relating to damage alleged at the Harmon and received proceeds of $55million.
 
In
 December 2014, the Perini matter was  concluded through a global settlement among the Company, MGM Resorts, Perini, the remaining subcontractors,including
 those implicated in the Harmon work (and their affiliates), and relevant insurers, which followed the previously disclosed settlement agreements and anextra-judicial
 program  for  settlement  of  certain  project  subcontractor  claims.  This  global  settlement  concluded  all  outstanding  claims  in  the  case  (the  “FinalSettlement”).
 The effectiveness of the global settlement was made contingent upon the Company’s execution of certain indemnity and release agreements (whichwere
 executed in January 2015) and the Company’s procurement of replacement general liability insurance covering construction of the CityCenter development(which was obtained in January 2015).
 
The Final Settlement, together with
 previous settlement agreements relating to the non-Harmon related lien claims,  resolved all of Perini’s and the remainingsubcontractors’
 lien claims against the Company and MGM Resorts, certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, MGM Resorts International Design (formerly known asMGM
 MIRAGE Design Group), and the Condo Owner Defendants. However, the Company expressly reserved any claims for latent or hidden defects as to anyportion
 of CityCenter’s original construction (other than the Harmon) not known to the Company at the time of the agreement.  The Company and MGM Resortsentered into the Final Set
tlement solely as a compromise and settlement and not in any way as an admission of liability or fault.   
The key terms of the Final Set
tlement included:   
With
 respect to its non-Harmon lien claims, Perini waived a specific portion of its lien claim against the Company, which combined with the prior non-Harmon
 agreement and accrued interest resulted in a total payment to Perini of $153 million, approximately $14 million of which was paid in December 2014. Thetotal
 payment to Perini was funded by MGM Resorts under their completion guarantee and included the application of approximately $58 million of condominiumproceeds that were previous
ly held in escrow by the Company to fund construction lien claims upon final resolution of the Perini litigation. 
The
 Company’s recovery for its Harmon construction defect claims, when added to the Harmon-related proceeds from prior insurance settlements of $85million,
 resulted in gross cash settlement proceeds to the Company of approximately $191 million (of which approximately $18 million was paid by MGM Resortsto CityCenter under the compl
etion guarantee in February 2015). 
15

 In
 conjunction with the Final Settlement, MGM Resorts and an insurer participating in the OCIP resolved their arbitration dispute concerning such insurersclaim
 for payments it made under the OCIP general liability coverage for contractor costs incurred in the Harmon litigation, premium adjustments and certain othercosts and expenses. MGM Resorts settled 
this dispute for $38 million, and funded the majority of such amounts under the completion guarantee in January 2015. 
Harmon.
As  discussed above, a global  settlement was reached in the Perini litigation in December 2014, which finally resolved all outstanding liens, claimsand counterclaims between the Company and
 MGM Resorts on one hand, and Perini, the remaining subcontractors and remaining insurers on the other hand. Amongthe
 matters resolved were the Company’s claims against Perini and other contractors and subcontractors with respect to construction at the Harmon. Pursuant toleave
 of  court  in  2014,  the  Company  commenced  demolition  of  the  building.  The  Company  has  completed  a  partial  demolition  of  the  building  and  is  currentlyevaluating
 options for further demolition and plans for the future use of the remaining structure. The Company believes the remaining demolition of the Harmonstructure if demolish
ed to the ground level would cost approximately $15 million. 
Other
litigation.
The  Company is a party to various legal proceedings that relate to construction and development matters and operational matters incidentalto
 its business. Management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financialstatements.
 The Company maintained an OCIP during the construction and development process. Under the OCIP, certain insurance coverages may cover a portionof the Company’s general li
ability, workers compensation, and other potential liabilities. 
Other
commitments.
The  Company entered into an agreement with a service provider for the initial and ongoing leasing of Crystals. Under the terms of theagreement,
 the Company was required to pay an annual service fee of approximately $2 million in 2011, increasing 3% each year through the initial term of theagreement, which
 expires in 2019. In addition to the service fee, the Company will be required to pay approximately $11 million at the termination of the agreementin
 2019, which is being recorded ratably over the contract term. As of December 31, 2015, the Company recorded $8 million related to such amount within “Otherlong-term obligations” 
in the consolidated balance sheet. Additional fees may be incurred if the service provider exercises its option to renew the agreement in 2019. 
Other
guarantees.
The Company is party to various guar antee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of creditissued by financial insti
tutions. The Company’s available borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $12 mil
lion in letters of credit outstanding. 
Leases

where
the
Company
is
a
lessee.
The  Company is party to various leases for real estate and equipment under operating lease arrangements. TheCompany’s future minim
um obligations under non-cancelable leases are immaterial in each of the next five years, and in total. 
Leases
where
the
Company

The Company enters into operat ing leases related to retail, dining and entertainment venues primarily at Crystals. Asof
 December  31,  2015,  the  Company  has  62  such  leases  in  place.  Tenants  are  primarily  responsible  for  tenant  improvements,  though  the  Company  providesconstruction
 allowances to certain lessees. Leases include base rent, common area maintenance charges and, in some cases, percentage rent based on the sales of thelessee.
 
Expected fixed future m
inimum lease payments for leases in place as of December 31, 2015 are as follows: 
For the year ending December 31,

ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
Residential

leases.
In  October of 2010, the Company began a program to lease a portion of unsold residential condominium units at Veer and MandarinOriental
 with minimum lease terms of one year. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 revenue from the real estate leasing program was $0.1million, $1 million and $3 m

In connection with the restated senior credit facility, MGM Resorts entered into a restated completion guarantee (as restated, the “completion guarantee”) that
supported
 the  remaining  construction  payables  from  the  construction  of  CityCenter.  The  terms  of  the  completion  guarantee  required  the  Company  to  use  $124million
 of  subsequent  net  residential  sale  proceeds  to  fund  construction  costs,  or  to  reimburse  MGM  Resorts  for  construction  costs  previously  expended.  As  ofDecember
 31, 2014, the Company had received net residential proceeds in excess of the $124 million and was holding $58 million in a condo proceeds accountrepresenting
 the remaining proceeds available to fund completion guarantee obligations or be reimbursed to MGM Resorts. The $58 million in condo proceeds wasrecorded
 within  “Restricted  cash”  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet  and  was  subsequently  used  to  fund  amounts  due  to  Perini  pursuant  to  thesettlement
 agreements under the Perini lawsuit. See Note 11 for further discussion of the Perini lawsuit. The completion guarantee was terminated in June 2015 andas of December 31, 2015, MGM Resorts had funded $888 m
