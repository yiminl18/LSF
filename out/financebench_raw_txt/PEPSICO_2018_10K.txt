Our Distribution Network
Our produ cts are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks.
The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.
Direct-Store-Delivery
We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail
stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with
maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store
promotion and merchandising.
Customer W arehouse
Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses. These less costly
systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover .
Distributor Networks
We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater
distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice
and vending business distributes beverages, foods and snacks to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party
foodservice and vending distributors and operators.
Our products are also available on a growing number of e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications as consumer
consumption patterns continue to change and retail increasingly expands online.
Ingredients and Other Supplies
The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice
concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice,
seasonings, sucralose, sugar , vegetable and essential oils, and
4
Table of Contents
wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack
foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also
important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our
products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant
continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and
commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk
through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and
futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and
suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make
investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative
to advanc e sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it globally . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial
statements for additional information on how we manage our exposure to commodity costs.

including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or
have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used
properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing
arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments.
In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness.
We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain  of our products, their packaging, the processes for
their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to
others.
Seasonality
Our busin esses are affected by seasonal variations. For instance, our beverage sales are higher during the warmer months and
certain food and dairy sales are higher in the cooler months. Weekly beverage  and snack sales are generally highest in the third
quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter . However , taken as a whole,
seasonality has not had a material impact on our
5
Table of Contents
consolidated financial results.
Our Customers
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customer s, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent
bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage
products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our
independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for
product quality . We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks
for specified geographic areas.
We rely on and provide financial incen tives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the
consumer . For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives inclu de volume-based rebates, product placement fees,
promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated
annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs , such as consumer incentives, advertising support,
new produ ct support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer  incentives include coupons, pricing discounts and
promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent
bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as
point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs
support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually .
Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the rapid growth of sales through e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and
digital operations among retailers, as well as the growth in hard discounters, and the current economic environment continue to
increase the importance of major customers. In 2018 , sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart), including Sam’ s Club (Sam’ s), represented
approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue. Our top five retail customers represented approximately 33% of our 2018  net
revenue in North America, with Walmart (including Sam’ s) representing approximately 19%. These percentages include
concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.
See “Off-Balance-S heet Arrangements” in “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7.
Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on our independent
bottlers.
Our Competition
Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of
international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and
private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors. In many countries in which our products are sold,
including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor . Other beverage, food and snack
competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company , Conagra Brands, Inc., Kellogg Company , Keurig Dr Pepper
Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company , Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A. and
Red Bull GmbH.
Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and
worldwide. In 2018 , we and The Coca- Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 20%, respectively , of the U.S. liquid
refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured
6
Table of Contents
channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However , The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD)
share advantage in many markets outside the United States.
Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste, price, value, quality ,
product variety, innovation, distribution , advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging, convenience, service and the
ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and
wellness and the continued acceleration  of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this
competitive environ ment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and
reformulations of existing products, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging,
pricing, increased efficiency in production techniques, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark
development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our
products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete ef fectively .
Resear ch and Development
We engage  in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting changing
consumer demands and preferences and accelerating sustainable growth. These activities principally involve: development of new
ingredients, flavors and products; reformulation and improvement in the quality and appeal of existing products; improvement and
modernization of manufacturing processes, including cost reduction; impro vements in product quality , safety and integrity;
development of, and improvements in, dispensing equipment, packaging technology (including investments in recycling-focused
technologies), package design (includin g development of sustainable, bio-based packaging) and portion sizes; efforts focused on
identifying opportun ities to transform, grow and broaden our product portfolio , including by developing products with improved
nutrition profiles that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat, including through the use of sweetener alternatives and flavor
modifiers and innovation in existing sweeteners, further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio (including through our
acquisition of SodaStream) and offering more products with positive nutrition including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy ,
protein and hydration; investments in building our capabilities to support our global e-commerce business; and improvements in
energy efficiency and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment. Our research centers are located around the
world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage nutrition
science, food science, engineering and consumer insights to meet our strategy to continue to develop nutritious and convenient
beverages, foods and snacks.
In 2018 , we continued to refine our beverage, food and snack portfolio to meet changing consumer demands by reducing added
sugars in many of our beverages and sodium and saturated fat in many of our foods and snacks, and by developing a broader
portfolio of product choices, including: continuing to expand our beverage options that contain no high-fructose corn syrup and that
are made with natural flavors; expanding our state-of-the-art food and beverage healthy vending initiative to increase the
availability of convenient and affordable nutrition; further expanding our portfolio of nutritious products by building on our
important nutrition platforms and brand s — Quaker (grains), Tropicana (juices , lemonades, fruit and vegetable drinks), Gatorade
(sports nutrition for athletes), Naked Juice (cold-pressed juices and smoothies), KeV ita (probiotics, tonics and fermented teas), Bare
(baked apple chips and other baked produce) and Health Warrior (nutrition bars); further expanding our whole grain products
globally; and further expanding our portfolio of nutritious products in growing categories, such as dairy , hummus and other
refrigerated dips, and baked grain snack s. In addition, we continued to make investments to reduce our impact on the environment,
including: efforts to conserve raw mate rials and energy, such as by working to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
across our global businesses, by helping to protect and conserve global water supply especially in high-water -risk locations
(including replenishing watersheds that source our operations in high-water -risk locations and
7
Table of Contents
promoting the efficient use of water in our agricultural supply chain), and by incorporating improvements in the sustainability and
resources of our agricultural supply chain into our operations; efforts to reduce waste generated by our operations and disposed of
in landfills; efforts to support increased  packaging recovery , recycling rates and the amount of recycled content in our packaging;
efforts to increase energy efficiency , including the increased use of renewable energy and resources; efforts to support sustainable
agriculture by expanding best practices with our growers and suppliers; and efforts to optimize packaging technology and design to
minimize the amount of plastic in our packaging, and make our packaging increasingly recoverable or recyclable with lower
environmental impact, including continuing to invest in developing compostable and biodegradable packaging.
Regulatory Matters
The conduct of our businesses, includ ing the production, storage, distribution, sale, display , advertising, marketing, labeling,
content, quality , safety , transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and
occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations
administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered
by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made,
manufactured, distri buted or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our
businesses.
The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws
governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various federal, state and local
environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the
Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state
laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity , such as the

Fair Labor Standards Act; customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our
products or ingredie nts used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; and laws
relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions

consumer protection laws such as Propo sition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that
contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of
such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.
We are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws
and regulations governing food safety , international trade and tariffs, occupatio nal health and safety , competition, anti-corruption
and data privacy , including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with
competition laws is of special importan ce to us due to our competitive position  in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-
corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operatio nal compliance programs, as well as in-house and
outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply
to our businesses.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture,
distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the
production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages,
while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly , some measures apply a single tax rate per
liquid ounce while others
8
Table of Contents
apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages
containing a particular substance or ingredient.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or
other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such
products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that
highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances
present in our products. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates or
encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from depo sit return systems designed to incentivize the return
of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and
other single-use plastics. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
We are also subject to national and local  environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business,
including laws related to water consum ption and treatment, wastewater dischar ge and air emissions. In the United States, our
facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liabil ity Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage,
release and disposal of wastes generat ed onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities and our
facilities outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over climate
change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate
the potential effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity
concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with
respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and any
expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and
our subsidiaries are subject to enviro nmental remediation obligations arisin g in the normal course of business, as well as
remediation and related indemnificatio n obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations,
including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification
obligations cannot be predicted with certainty , such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Employees
As of December 29, 2018 , we and our consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 267,000 people worldwide, including
approximately 114,000 people within the United States. In certain countries, our employment levels are subject to seasonal
variations. We or our subsidiaries are party to numerous collective bargainin g agreements. We expect that we will be able to
renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.  We believe that relations with our
employees are generally good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form
10-K, including the Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and the
consolidated financi al statements and related notes. Any of the factors described below could occur or continue to occur and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded
securities. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we
currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future and may also adversely af fect our business, reputation,
financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating results,
financial and busine ss performance, events and trends may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and
business performance, events or trends.
Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to
innovate, market or distribute our products effectively , and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are a global food and beverage company operating in highly competitive categories and markets. To generate revenues and
profits, we rely on continued demand for our products and therefore must understand our customers and consumers and sell
products that appeal to them in the sales  channel in which they prefer to shop or browse for such products. In general, changes in
consumption in our product categories or consumer demographics could result  in reduced demand for our products. Demand for
our products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences,
including increased demand for product s that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with: health and wellness (including
products that have less added sugars, sodium and saturated fat); convenience (including responding to changes in in-home and on-
the-go consumption patterns and methods of distribution of our products to customers and consumers, including through e-
commerce and hard discounters); or the location of origin or source of ingredients and products (including the environmental
impact related to production of our products).
Consumer preferenc es have been evolving, and are expected to continue to evolve, due to a variety of factors, including: changes in
consumer demographics, including the aging of the general population and the emer gence of the millennial and younger
generations who have differing spending, consumption and purchasing habits; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the
nutrition profile of products, including the presence of added sugar , sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products; growing
demand for or ganic or locally sourced ingredients, or consumer concerns or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding the
10
Table of Contents
health effects of ingredients or substan ces present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, artificial flavors and
colors, artificial sweeteners, aspartame, caffeine, furfuryl alcohol, high-fructose  corn syrup, partially hydrolyzed oils, saturated fat,
sodium, sugar , trans fats or other product ingredients, substances or attributes, including genetically engineered ingredients; taxes
or other restrictions, including labeling requirements, imposed on our products; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding
packaging materials, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and their environmental impact; changes in package or
portion size; chang es in social trends that impact travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or
seasonal consumption cycles; the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of purchasing products; negative
publicity (whether or not valid) resulting from regulatory actions, litigation against us or other companies in our industry or
negative or inaccurate posts or comments in the media, including social media, about us, our employees, our products or
advertising campaigns and marketing programs; perception of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract
manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or our respective social media posts, business practices or
other infor mation disseminated by or regarding them or us; product boycotts; or a downturn in economic conditions. Any of these
factors may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase our products and any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such
changes could result  in reduced demand for our products or erode our competitive and financial position and could adversely affect
our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Demand for our products is also depe ndent in part on product quality , product and marketing innovation and production and
distribution, including our ability to: maintain a robust pipeline of new products; improve the quality of existing products; extend
our portfo lio of products in growing markets and categories (through acquisitions, such as SodaStream, and innovation, such as
increasing non-carb onated beverage offerings and other alternatives to, or reformulations of, carbonated beverage offerings);
respond to cultural differences and regional consumer preferences (whether through developing or acquiring new products that are
responsive to such preferences); monitor and adjust our use of ingredients and packaging materials (including to respond to
applicable regulations); develop sweetener alternatives and innovation; increase the recyclability or recoverability of our
packaging; improve the production and distribution of our products; respond to competitive product and pricing pressures and
changes in distribution channels, including in the e-commerce channel; and implement effective advertising campaigns and
marketing programs , including successfully adapting to a rapidly changing media environment through the use of social media and
online advertising campaigns and marketing programs.
Although we devote significant resourc es to the items mentioned above, there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to
develop, launch, maintain or distribute  successful new products or variants of existing products in a timely manner (including
correctly anticipating or effectively reacting to changes in consumer preferences) or to develop and effectively execute advertising
and marke ting campaigns that appeal to customers and consumers. Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive
innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products or effectively market or distribute our products
could reduce demand for our products, result in inventory write-of fs and erode our competitive and financial position and could
adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in laws and regulations relating to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging of our products could continue to
increase our costs, reduce demand for our products or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial
condition or results of operations.
Certain of our food and beverage products are sold in plastic or other packaging designed to be recoverable for recycling but not all
packaging is recovered, whether due to low value, lack of infrastructure or otherwise. In addition, certain of our packaging may
currently not be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable. There is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic and other
packaging waste in the environment,
11
Table of Contents
particularly in the world’ s oceans and waterways. As a result, our branded packaging waste could result in negative publicity
(whether or not valid) or reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
In respons e to these concerns, the United States and many other jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing regulations
or policies designed to increase the susta inability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increase recycling rates or facilitate
the waste management process or restri cting the sale of products in certain packaging. These regulations vary in scope and form
from taxes or fees designed to incentivize behavior to restrictions or bans on certain products and materials. For example, the state
of Califor nia is one of 10 states in the United States that have a bottle deposi t return system in effect, which requires a deposit
charged to consumers to incentivize the return of the beverage container . In addition, 26 markets in the European Union have
established extended producer responsibility policies, which make manufacturers such as us responsible for the costs of recycling
products after consumers have used them. Further , certain jurisdictions are considering imposing other types of regulations or
policies, including packaging taxes, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to the plastic bottle, minimum recycled content
mandates, which would require packag ing to include a certain percentage of post-consumer recycled material in a new package,
and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and other single-use plastics. These laws and regulations, whatever their
scope or form, could  increase the cost of our products, reduce consumer deman d and overall consumption of our products or result
in negative publicity (whether or not valid), which could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
While we continue to devote significan t resources to increase the recyclability  and sustainability of our packaging, the increased
focus on reducing plastic waste may require us to increase capital expenditures, including requiring additional investments to
minimize the amount of plastic across our packaging; increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging; and develop
sustainable, bio-base d packaging as a replacement for fossil fuel-based plastic packaging, including flexible film alternatives for
our snacks packaging. Our failure to minimize our plastics use, increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging or
develop sustainable packaging or consumers’ failure to accept such sustainab le packaging could reduce consumer demand and
overall consumption of our products and erode our competitive and financial position. Further , our reputation could be damaged for
failure to achieve our sustainability goals with respect to our plastics use, including our goal to use 25% recycled content in our
plastic packaging by 2025, or if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to
packaging or disposal of our products.
Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could
adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The condu ct of our business is subjec t to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental
agencies in the United States, as well as government entities and agencies outsid e the United States, including laws and regulations
relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display , advertisin g, marketing, labeling, content, quality , safety ,
transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and
safety practices and protection of person al information. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of
special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. Many of
these laws and regulations have differing or conflicting legal standards across the various markets where our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold and, in certain markets, such as developing and emer ging markets, may be less developed or
certain. For example, products containing genetically engineered ingredients are subject to differing regulations and restrictions in
the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, as is the packaging, disposal and recyclability
of our products. For example, five provinces in Canada, covering most of the Canadian market, have
12
Table of Contents
established extended producer responsibility policies, which make manufacturers such as us responsible for the costs of recycling
products after consumers have used them. In addition, these laws and regulations and related interpretations may change,
sometimes dramatic ally and unexpectedly , as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such
changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising and marketing practices,
including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed; laws and treaties related to international trade, including
laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws and programs aimed at
reducing, restricting  or eliminating ingre dients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products; laws and programs aimed
at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products, including laws imposing
restrictions on the use of government funds or programs to purchase certain of our products; increased regulatory scrutiny of, and
increased litigation involving product claims and concerns (whether or not valid) regarding the effects on health of ingredients or
substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products, including without limita tion those found in energy drinks; state consumer
protection laws; laws regulating the protection of personal information; cyber -security regulations; regulatory initiatives, including
the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other measures impacting the manufacture, distribution or sale
of our products; accounting rules and interpretations; employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for
our products; laws regulating water rights and access to and use of water or utilities; environmental laws, including laws relating to
the regula tion of water treatment and dischar ge of wastewater and air emissi ons and laws relating to the disposal, recovery or
recycling of our products and their packaging. Changes in regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, and dif fering
or competing regulations and standards  across the markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, may
result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, which could adversely affect our business,
reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
The imposition of new laws, regulatio ns or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the
foregoing, including  taxes, labeling, product, production, recovery or recycling requirements, or other limitations on, or pertaining
to, the sale or adve rtisement of certain of our products, ingredients or subst ances contained in, or attributes of, our products,
commodities used in the production of our products or use, disposal, recovery or recyclability of our products and their packaging,
may further alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand
for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If one jurisdiction imposes
or proposes to impo se new requirements or restrictions, other jurisdictions may follow . For example, if one jurisdiction imposes a
tax on sugar-sweetened beverages or foods, or imposes a specific labeling or warning requirement, other jurisdictions may impose
similar or other measures that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products. The foregoing may result in decreased
demand for our products, adverse publi city or increased concerns about the health implications of consumption of ingredients or
substances in our products (whether or not valid).
In addition, studies (whether or not scientifically valid) have been and continue to be underway by third parties purporting to assess
the health implications of consumptio n of certain ingredients or substances  present in certain of our products or packaging
materials, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, caffeine, glyphosate, furfuryl alcohol, added sugars, sodium, saturated fat and plastic. Third
parties have also published documents or studies claiming (whether or not valid ) that taxes can address consumer consumption of
sugar -sweetened beverages and foods high in sugar , sodium or saturated fat. If, as a result of these studies and documents or
otherwise, there is an increase in consumer concerns (whether or not valid) abou t the health implications of consumption of certain
of our products, an increase in the number of jurisdictions that impose taxes  on our products, or an increase in new labeling,
product or productio n requirements or other restrictions on the manufacturing , sale or display of our products, demand for our
products could decline, or we could be subject
13
Table of Contents
to lawsuits  or new regulations that could affect sales of our products, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our employees,
suppliers, or other third parties with whom we do business could take actions, intentional or not, that violate these policies and
procedures or applicable laws or regulations or could fail to maintain required documentation sufficient to evidence our compliance
with applicable laws or regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil
enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgor gement of profits or activity restrictions, any of
which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, regulatory authorities
under whose laws we operate may have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall, seizure of
products or assets or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on the sales of products in our portfolio or could lead to
damage to our reputation.
In addition , we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environm ental remediation obligations arising in the normal
course of business, as well as environmental remediation, product liability , toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in
connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our
subsidiaries. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current
and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries, the potential exists for reme diation, liability and indemnification costs to differ
materially from the costs we have estim ated. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our
estimates or otherwise have an adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The imposition or proposed imposition  of new or increased taxes aimed at our products could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or
attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our produc ts. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply
to all beverages, including non-caloric  beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar).
Similarly , some measures apply a single tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the
amount of added sugar in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient.
For examp le, effective January 2018, the City of Seattle, Washington in the United States enacted a per-ounce surchar ge on all
sugar -sweetened beverages. By contrast, France revised an existing flat tax to become a graduated tax, effective July 2018, in
which the per-ounce  tax rate is tied to the amount of added sugar present in the beverage: the higher the amount of added sugar , the
higher the per-ounce tax rate, while Saudi Arabia enacted, effective June 2017, a flat tax rate of 50%, and Jordan increased,
effective January 2018, its flat tax from 10% to 20%, on the retail price of carbonated soft drinks. These tax measures, whatever
their scope or form,  could increase the cost of our products, reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products,
lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid)
that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition
or results of operations.
Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may reduce
demand for such products and could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or
14
Table of Contents
sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. These types of provisions have
required that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of
certain ingredients or substances presen t in our products. For example, in California in the United States, Proposition 65 requires a
specific warning on or relating to any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to
cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor
level established by the State of California.
In addition, a numb er of jurisdictions, both in and outside the United States, have imposed or are considering imposing labeling
requirements, including color -coded labeling of certain food and beverage products where colors such as red, yellow and green are
used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar , sodium or saturated fat. The imposition or proposed
imposition of additional product labeling or warning requirements could reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to
negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our
products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could suf fer if we are unable to compete ef fectively .
Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of
international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and
private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors. In many countries in which our products are sold,
including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor . Other beverage, food and snack
competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company , Conagra Brands, Inc., Kellogg Company , Keurig Dr Pepper
Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company , Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A. and
Red Bull GmbH.
Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste, price, value, quality ,
product variety, innovation, distribution , advertising, marketing and promotional activity , packaging, convenience, service and the
ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and
wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. If we are unable
to effectively promote our existing products or introduce new products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective,
if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to pricing pressure or
compete effectively  (including in distributing our products effectively and cost efficiently through all existing and emer ging
channels of trade, including through e-commerce and hard discounters), we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category
share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, which may adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity initiatives or operating model could have an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our future success and earnings growth depend, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies,
including implementing shared business service organizational models. Our productivity initiatives help support our growth
initiatives and contribute to our result s of operations. We continue to implement productivity initiatives that we believe will
position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve  a lower cost structure and operate more efficiently
in the highly competitive beverage, food and snack categories and markets. W e are also continuing to implement our initiatives to
15
Table of Contents
improve efficiency , decision making, innovation and brand management across our global organization to enable us to compete
more effectively . Further, in order to continue to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts and operating model, it will be necessary to
make certain investments in our busine ss, which may be limited due to capita l constraints. Some of these measures could yield
unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced employee morale and
productivity , and unexpected additional employee attrition, including the inability to attract or retain key personnel. It is critical that
we have the approp riate personnel in place to continue to lead and execute our plans, including to effectively manage personnel
adjustments and transitions resulting from these initiatives and increased competition for employees with the skills necessary to
implement our plans. If we are unable to successfully implement our producti vity initiatives as planned, fail to implement these
initiatives as timely as we anticipate, do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives or incur higher than expected or
unanticipated costs in implementing these initiatives, fail to identify and implement additional productivity opportunities in the
future, or fail to successfully manage business disruptions or unexpected employee consequences on our workforce, morale or
productivity , we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely af fect our business, financial condition
or results of operations.
Our busin ess, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of political conditions in the
markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold.
Political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufacture d, distributed or sold may be difficult to predict and
may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operatio ns. The results of elections, referendums or other
political conditions  (including government shutdowns) in these markets could impact how existing laws, regulations and
government programs or policies are implemented or create uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations and government programs
or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, climate change regulation, taxes, benefit programs, the
movement of goods, services and people between countries and other matters, and could result in exchange rate fluctuation,
volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products. For example, the
United Kingdom’ s pending withdrawal from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit) could lead to differing laws and
regulations in the United Kingdom and European Union. Any changes in, or the imposition of new laws, regulations or
governmental policy and their related interpretations due to elections, referendums or other political conditions could have an
adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.
Our busin ess, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in
developing and emerging markets.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emer ging markets, including Mexico, Russia, the
Middle East, Brazil, China and India. However , there can be no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing
products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular
developing or emer ging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or
otherwise. The following factors could reduce demand for our products or otherwise impede the growth of our business in
developing and emer ging markets: unstable economic, political or social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest;
increased competition; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets and the related impact on developed countries
who export to these  markets; volatile oil prices and the impact on the local economy in certain of these markets; our inability to
acquire businesses, form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments; our inability to complete
divestitures or refranchisings; impositio n of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other restrictions;
our inability to hire or retain a highly skilled workforce; imposition of new or increased tariffs and other impositions on imported
goods or sanctions against, or other regulations restricting contact with, certain countries in these
16
Table of Contents
markets, or imposit ion of new or increased sanctions against U.S. multination al corporations or tariffs on the products of such
corporations operating in these markets; actions, such as removing our products from shelves, taken by retailers in response to U.S.
trade sanctions, tariffs or other governmental action or policy; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the
assets of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; imposition of taxes
on our products or the ingredients or substances used in our products; governm ent-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our
operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers , distributors, joint venture partners, customers or
other third  parties; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredi ents or substances used in our products; regulations
relating to the repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States; highly inflationary economies,
devaluation or fluctuation, such as the devaluation of the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and the
Mexican peso, or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls
or other currency exchange restrictions,  which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or could
significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and could result in the
deconsolidation of such businesses, such as occurred with respect to our Venezuelan businesses which were deconsolidated at the
end of the third quarter of 2015; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to
compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse
consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. If we are
unable to expand our businesses in developing and emer ging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with
operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our business,
reputation, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely af fected.
Uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
Many of the countri es in which our products are made, manufactured, distribute d and sold have experienced and may, from time to
time, continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns. Our
business or financial results may be adversely impacted by uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the United States and
globally , including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets, including speculative
influences; highly-in flationary economie s, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit in the
marketplace due to legislation or economic conditions; the effects of government initiatives, including demonetization, austerity or
stimulus measures to manage economic conditions and any changes to or cessation of such initiatives; the effects of any default by
or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold or of
countries that may then impact countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; reduced demand for
our products resulting from volatility in general global economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic
reasons or otherwise to regional, local or private label products or other lower -cost products, or to less profitable sales channels; or
a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding
requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will
affect our customers, consumers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties
and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impa ct on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
In addition, some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions, including U.S. and non-U.S. commercial
banks, insurance companies, investment banks and other financial institutions may be
17

exposed to a ratings downgrade, bankruptcy , liquidity events, default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic
conditions, changing regulatory requirem ents or other factors beyond our control. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy , receivership,
default or similar event involving a major financial institution, or changes in the regulatory environment, may limit the ability or
willingness of financial institutions to enter into financial transactions with us, including to provide banking or related cash
management service s, or to extend credit on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all; may leave us with reduced borrowing
capacity or exposed to certain currencie s or price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials, including through our
use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures; or
may result in a decline in the market value of our investments in debt secur ities, which could have an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operations. Similar risks exist with respect to our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract
manufacturers, distributors and joint venture partners and could result in their inability to obtain credit to purchase our products or
to finance the manufacture and distribution of our products resulting in canceled orders and/or product delays, which could also
have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to,
cyberattacks or other cyber incidents or if our information systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract
manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise disrupted.
We depend on infor mation systems and technology , some of which are provid ed by third parties, including public websites and
cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including: to interface with our customers and consumers; to
engage in marketing activities; to enab le and improve the effectiveness of our operations; to order and manage materials from
suppliers; to manage inventory; to manage and operate our facilities; to conduct research and development; to maintain accurate
financial records; to achieve operational efficiencies; to comply with regulatory , financial reporting, legal and tax requirements; to
collect and store sensitive data and confidential information; to communicate electronically among our global operations and with
our employees and the employees of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contrac t manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners
and other third parties; and to communicate with our investors.
Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently , are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more
sophisticated and are being carried out by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored actors,
criminal and terrorist organizations, individuals or groups participating in organized crime and insiders) with a wide range of
expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of computing
resources, financial fraud, operational disruption, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and
leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms
including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, such as impersonation attempts to fraudulently induce employees or
others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data, introduction of viruses or malware, such as
ransomware through phishing emails, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of
computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromises. As with other global companies, we are
regularly subject to cyberattacks, including many of the types of attacks described above. Although we may incur significant costs
in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, no cyberattack or other cyber incident has, to our
knowledge, had a material adverse ef fect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date.
If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology
infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security policies and
18
Table of Contents
the skills and training of our employees, and requiring our third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract
manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify or
appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, or if our or their information systems are damaged, compromised,
destroyed or shut down (whether as a result of natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events,
network outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, technolo gy development defects, user errors, lapses in our
controls or the intentional or negligent  actions of employees, or from deliberate cyberattacks such as malicious or disruptive
software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering, hackers or otherwise), our business could be disrupted and we
could, among other things, be subject to: transaction errors; processing inefficiencies; the loss of, or failure to attract, new
customers and consumers; lost revenues resulting from the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information
technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or the loss of a competitive advantage
due to the unauthorized use, acquisition  or disclosure of, or access to, confiden tial information; the incurrence of costs to restore
data and to safeguar d against future extortion attempts; the loss of, or damage to, intellectual property or trade secrets, including the
loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensit ive data or other assets; alteration, corruption or loss of accounting, financial or other data
on which we rely for financial reporting and other purposes, which could cause  errors or delays in our financial reporting; damage
to our reputation or brands; damage to employee, customer and consumer relations; litigation; regulatory enforcement actions or
fines; unauthorized disclosure of confidential personal information of our employees, customers or consumers; the loss of
information and/or supply chain disruption resulting from the failure of security patches to be developed and installed on a timely
basis; violation of data privacy , security or other laws and regulations; and remediation costs.
Further , our informa tion systems and those of our third-party providers, and the information stored therein could be compromised,
including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods, resultin g in unauthorized parties accessing or extracting
sensitive data or confidential information. Failure to comply with data privacy laws could result in litigation, claims, legal or
regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations.
We continue to devo te significant resources to network security , backup and disaster recovery , enhancing our internal controls, and
other security measures, including training, to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute
security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every such breach or disruption. In addition, due to
the constantly evolving nature of these security threats, the form and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.
Similar risks exist with respect to the cloud-based service providers and other third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of
our inform ation technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan
administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties
and their vendors. The need to coordinate with various third-party vendors may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that
may arise.  As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party vendors may adversely affect our
business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. Moreover , our increased use of mobile
and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may
be complex, unpredictable or beyond our control.
While we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated
with certain aspects of cyber incidents, network failures and data privacy-related concerns, this insurance coverage may not,
depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise
from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.

Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or
shortages of raw materials, energy , water and other supplies.
We and our business partners use various raw materials, energy, water and other  supplies in our business. The principal ingredients
we use in our bever age, food and snack  products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame,
corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour , grapefruit, oats, oranges and other fruits, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose,
sugar , vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. W e also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials
include plastic resins, including PET and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack
foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also
important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our
products.
Some of these raw materials and supplies are sourced from countries experienc ing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable
economic conditions, and some are available from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier or are in short supply when
seasonal demand is at its peak. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with
these suppliers or that our contingency plans, including development of ingredients, materials or supplies to replace ingredients,
materials or supplies sourced from such suppliers, will be effective in preven ting disruptions that may arise from shortages or
discontinuation of any ingredient that is sourced from such suppliers. In addition, increasing focus on climate change, deforestation,
water , animal welfare and human right s concerns and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased
activism focusing on consumer goods companies, governmental intervention and consumer response, and could adversely affect
our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. The raw
materials and energy, including fuel, that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are largely
commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in global
supply and demand , weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters (such as a
hurricane, tornado, earthquake or flood ing), disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry),
agricultural uncertai nty, health epidemics or pandemics, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions,
such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), limited or sole sources of supply , political uncertainties, acts of
terrorism, governme ntal instability or currency exchange rates. For example, in 2018, the United States imposed tariffs on steel and
aluminum as well as on goods imported from China and certain other countrie s, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China
and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade
measures taken by China or other countr ies in response, could result in an increa se in supply chain costs that we may not be able to
offset or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. Shortage of some of these raw materials and other supplies, sustained
interruption in their supply or an increase in their costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations. Many of our ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such
items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing
agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. If commodity price changes result in unexpected or significant
increases in raw materials and energy costs, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively
hedge against commodity price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and
operating results. In addition, certain of the derivatives used to hedge price risk do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and,
therefore, can result in increased volat ility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the spot prices of the
underlying commodities.

Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of available water of acceptable quality and increasing pressure to
conserve water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations; higher
compliance costs; capital expenditures (including additional investments in the development of technologies to enhance water
efficiency and reduce water consumption); higher production costs; the cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or
the faciliti es of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; or damage
to our reputation, any of which could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Business disruptions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our abilit y, and that of our suppliers and other third parties, including our bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint
venture partners and customers, to make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio is critical to our
success. Damage or disruption to our or their operations due to any of the following factors could impair the ability to make,
manufacture, transport, distribute or sell products in our portfolio: adverse weather conditions (including any potential effects of
climate change) or natural disasters, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or flooding; government action; economic or political
uncertainties or instability in countries in which such products are made, manu factured, distributed or sold, which may also affect
our ability  to protect the security of our assets and employees; fire; terrorism ; outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; food
safety warnings or recalls, whether related to products in our portfolio or otherwise; health epidemics or pandemics; supply and
commodity shortages; unplanned delays or unexpected problems associated with repairs or enhancements of facilities in which
such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites; cyber incidents,
including the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants,
warehouses, distribu tion centers or other facilities or those of our suppliers and other third parties who make, manufacture,
transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues;
telecommunications failures; power or water shortages; strikes, labor disputes or lack of availability of qualified personnel, such as
truck drive rs; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and other third parties. Failure to take adequate
steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur , could
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore
operations.
Product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality , safety and integrity could adversely
affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality , safety and integrity , including with
respect to raw mate rials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegation s (whether or not valid) of product quality issues,
mislabeling, misbran ding, spoilage, allergens, adulteration or contamination with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce
demand for such products, and cause production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which could adversely affect our
business, reputation, financial condition  or results of operations. If any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become
unfit for consumptio n or cause injury , illness or death, or if appropriate resou rces are not devoted to product quality and safety
(particularly as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply with changing food safety requirements, we could decide
to, or be required to, recall products in our portfolio and/or we may be subject to liability or government action, which could result
in payment of dama ges or fines, cause certain products in our portfolio to be unavailable for a period of time, result in destruction
of product inventory , or result in advers e publicity (whether or not valid), which could reduce consumer demand and brand equity .
Moreover , even if allegations of product contamination or tampering or suggestions that our products were not fit for consumption
are meritless, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against us or products in our portfolio or processes could adversely
affect our reputation or brands. Our business could
21
Table of Contents
also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality , safety and integrity generally , even if such loss of
confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial
condition or results of operations. In addition, if we do not have adequate insura nce, if we do not have enforceable indemnification
from supp liers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or if indemnification is not
available, the liability relating to such product claims or disruption as a result of recall efforts could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are a leading global beverage, food and snack company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world.
Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely
impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high
ethical, social and environmental practi ces for all of our operations and activi ties, including with respect to human rights, child
labor laws and workplace conditions and safety , or failure to require our suppliers or other third parties to do so; the failure to
achieve our goals of reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fat in certai n of our products and of growing our portfolio of
product choices; the failure to achieve our other sustainability goals, including with respect to plastic packaging, or to be perceived
as appropriately addressing matters of social responsibility; the failure to protect our intellectual property , including in the event our
brands are used without our authorization; health concerns (whether or not valid) about our products or particular ingredients or
substances in, or attributes of, our produ cts, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity; the
imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes, labeling requirements or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the
sale, displ ay or advertising of our produ cts; any failure to comply , or perception of a failure to comply , with our policies and goals,
including those regarding advertising to children and reducing calorie consumption from sugar -sweetened beverages; our research
and development efforts; the recall (voluntary or otherwise) of any products in our portfolio; our environmental impact, including
use of agricultural materials, plastics or other packaging, water , energy use and waste management; any failure to achieve our goals
with respect to reducing our impact on the environment, including the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging, or
perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment; any failure to achieve our goals with
respect to human rights throughout our value chain; the practices of our employ ees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract
manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties (includin g others in our industry) with respect to any of the
foregoing, actual or perceived; consumer perception of our industry; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns,
sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs; consumer perception of our use of social media; consumer perception of
statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents, customers, supp liers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors,
joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry); or our responses or the responses of others in our
industry to any of the foregoing.
In addition , we operate globally , which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations, including, without limitation, anti-
corruption laws, competition laws and tax laws and regulations of the jurisdicti ons in which our products are made, manufactured,
distributed or sold. In the event that we or our employees engage in or are believ ed to have engaged in improper activities, we may
be subject to regulatory proceedings, including enforcement actions, litigation, loss of sales or other consequences, which may
cause us to suffer damage to our reputation in the United States or abroad. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to
maintain an effective system of intern al control or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our
reputation. In addition, water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and demand for water continues to rise. Our
reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to water
use.

Further , the popularity of social media and other consumer -oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of
information dissemination. As a result, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us, our products, policies, practices,
advertising campaigns and marketing programs or sponsorship arrangement s; our use of social media or of posts or other
information dissemi nated by us or our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint
venture partners or other third parties; consumer perception of any of the foregoing, or failure by us to respond effectively to any of
the foregoing, may also generate adverse publicity (whether or not valid) that could damage our reputation.
Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products or employees for any of these or other
reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.
Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or
effectively manage divestitures or refranchisings, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
We regula rly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisiti ons, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and
other strategic transa ctions. Potential issues associated with these activities could include, among other things: our ability to realize
the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or syner gies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time
frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction; and diversion of
management’ s attention from day-to-day operations.
With respect to acquisitions, including our recently completed acquisition of SodaStream, the following factors also pose potential
risks: our ability to successfully combine our businesses with the business of the acquired company , including integrating the
acquired company’ s manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and
information technology systems with our company; our ability to successfully operate in new categories or territories; motivating,
recruiting and retaining executives and key employees (both of the acquired company and our company); conforming standards,
controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, environmental compliance,
health and safety compliance and compliance with other laws and regulations), procedures and policies, business cultures and
compensation struct ures between us and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative
infrastructures and avoiding increased operating expenses; consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing
customers and attracting new customers ; retaining existing distributors; identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming
operations and assets; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with
integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as
contingent liabilities and litigation.
With respect to joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsibility with one or more parties who may or may not
have the same goals , strategies, priorities, resources or values as we do. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of
all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners
may adve rsely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us or otherwise damage our
reputation and brands and adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, acquisitions and joint ventures outside of the United States increas e our exposure to risks associated with operations
outside of the United States, including fluctuations in exchange rates and comp liance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and laws and regulations outside the United States.

Table of Contents
With respe ct to divestitures and refranc hisings, we may not be able to complet e or effectively manage such transactions on terms
commercially favor able to us or at all and may fail to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestiture or
refranchising. Furth er, as divestitures and refranchisings may reduce our direct control over certain aspects of our business, any
failure to maintain good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain may adversely impact our
sales or business performance.
If an acqu isition or joint venture is not successfully completed, integrated into our existing operations or managed effectively , or if
a divestitu re or refranchising is not successfully completed or managed effectiv ely or does not result in the benefits or cost savings
we expect, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely af fected.
A change in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in an
impairment charge, which could materially af fect our results of operations.
We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets , as well as other investments and other long-lived
assets annually , during our third quarter , or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Any changes in our estima tes or underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our reporting units or in
determining the fair value of any such reporting unit, including goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other
investments and other long-lived assets, could adversely affect our results of operations. Factors that could result in an impairment
include, but are not limited to: significant negative economic or industry trends or competitive operating conditions; significant
macroeconomic conditions that may result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value;
and signif icant changes in the nature and timing of decisions regarding assets or markets that do not perform consistent with our
expectations, includ ing factors we use to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. Future impairment charges
could have a significant adverse ef fect on our results of operations in the periods recognized.
Increases in income tax rates, change s in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax
rates or other change s in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and
could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the United States generate a
significant portion of our income. In addition, the United States and many of the other countries in which our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have recently made or are actively
considering changes  to existing tax laws. For example, in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) was signed into
law in the United States. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are
based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) could impact our recorded amounts in future periods. For furth er information regarding the impact and potential
impact of the TCJ Act, see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7. Management’ s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including
changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations. For example, the Organizat ion for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has recommended changes to
numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. These changes, to
the extent adopted,
24
Table of Contents
may incre ase tax uncertainty , result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of
operations and/or cash flow .
We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and
non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. In connection with the OECD’ s BEPS project, companies are
required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of
profits earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate,
or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final
resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historic al provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse
impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
If we are unable to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, it could have a negative
impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our conti nued growth requires us to recruit, hire, retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse
workforce. We compete to recruit and hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Our
employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively
depends on our ability to retain, develo p and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned
turnover or unsuccessful implementatio n of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief
Executive Officer, or to hire and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce could deplete our institutional knowledge base and
erode our competitiv e advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover
or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or
results of operations.
The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer could adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customer s, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent
bottlers, among others. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Wal-Mart, to
compete effectively . Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition
(financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer , or
the loss of any of our key customers could adversely af fect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Disruption in the retail landscape, including rapid growth in hard discounters and the e-commerce channel, could adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our industry has been affected by changes to the retail landscape, includin g the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce
websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services as well as the integration of physical and digital operations
among retailers. We continue to make significant investments in attracting talent to and building our global e-commerce
capabilities. Althoug h we are engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of our products, if we are unable to maintain and
develop successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers  or otherwise adapt to the growing e-commerce
landscape, while simultaneously maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels, we may
be disadvantaged in certain channels and with certain customers and consumers, which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the growth in e-comm erce and hard discounters may result in consumer
price deflation, which may af fect our relationships with key retail
25
Table of Contents
customers. Further , the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure
on us to maintain competitive prices. If these e-commerce and hard discounter retailers were to take significant market share away
from traditional retailers and/or we fail to adapt to the rapidly changing retail and e-commerce landscapes, our ability to maintain
and grow our profita bility , share of sales or volume and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely
affected.
Further , the retail landscape continues to be impacted by the increased consol idation of retail ownership and purchasing power ,
particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers with increased purchasing power , which may
impact our ability to compete in these areas. Such retailers may demand improved efficiency , lower pricing and increased
promotional programs. Further , should larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks, other distribution
channels such as e-commerce, or private label brands, the competitive advanta ges we derive from our go-to-market systems and
brand equity may be eroded. In addition, the growth of hard discounters that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell
and selling predominantly private label brands may reduce our ability to sell our products through such retailers. Failure to
appropriately respon d to any of the foregoing, including failure to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our
customers, could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space and produc t availability at our retailers, adversely affect our
ability to maintain or grow our share of sales or volume, and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade
of our credit ratings.
Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors,
including our cash generating capability , levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial
strength generally , as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-curre nt state of the economy and our industry generally .
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether as a
result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access
capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, and result in a reduction in our liquidity . We expect to
maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to
global credit markets at favorable interest rates. However , any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our
ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically , and therefore require
us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market
could also be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An
increase in our borrowing costs, limita tions on our ability to access the globa l capital and credit markets or a reduction in our
liquidity could adversely af fect our financial condition and results of operations.
If we are not able to successfully implement shared services or utilize informa tion technology systems and networks effectively ,
our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted.
We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to utilize information technology support services and
administrative functions in certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and
certain finance and accounting functions . We may enter into new or additional agreements for shared services in other functions in
the future to achieve cost savings and ef ficiencies as we continue to migrate to shared business service or ganizational models across
our busine ss operati ons. In addition, we utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to
process, transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees,
customers, consumers and other third parties. If any of these third-party service
26
Table of Contents
providers or vendors do not perform effectively , or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance (including compliance with
service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements), we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings, we may
have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service provider s, our reputation could be harmed or we could be
subject to litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. Depending on the function involved, such
errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data
through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, or
damage to our reputation, which could have a negative impact on employee morale. In addition, the management of multiple third-
party service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control.
We continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial
processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business
transformation initia tive, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. If we do not
allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if
we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and
efficiently , and remain in step with the changing needs of our business, which could result in the loss of customers or consumers
and revenue. In addition, the failure to either deliver the applications on time,  or anticipate the necessary readiness and training
needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers or consumers and revenue. In connection with these implementations
and resulti ng business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls,
including our internal control over finan cial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. To date,
this transition has not materially af fected, and we do not expect it to materially af fect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Because our
consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United
States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar , are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the
United States, particularly in Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil , generate a signific ant portion of our net
revenue. In addition , we purchase many of the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous
markets and in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of currency controls or other currency
exchange restrictions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Climate change, water scarcity or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity may
negatively af fect our business and operations or damage our reputation.
There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures,
weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has
a negative effect on agricultural productivity , we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain
commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits and potatoes.
Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or flooding, may disrupt the
productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain and unfavorab ly impact the demand for, or our consumers’ ability
to purchase, our products. The predicted effects of climate change may also exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and
quality of water . As demand for water access continues to increase
27
Table of Contents
around the world, we may be subject to decreased availability of water , deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for
water , which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations.
Concern over clima te change may resul t in new or increased regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to
reduce or mitigate the effects of greenh ouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local
water scarcity concerns. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations or the measures that
we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency and water conservation, we may experience disruptions
in, or significant increases in our costs of, operation and delivery and we may be required to make additional investments in
facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular , increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase
the cost of energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transpor t and distribute our products, thereby substantially
increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products.  As a result, the effects of climate change or water
scarcity could negatively af fect our business and operations.
In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impac t on the environment or perception (whether or not
valid) of our failure  to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes
in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or water scarcity could result in adverse publicity and could
adversely af fect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
There is also increas ed focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers
on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact, water use and
recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including plastic. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do
not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment.
A portion of our workforce is represented by unions. Failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or
strikes or work stoppages, could cause our business to suf fer.
Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by
collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew
these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms or if we are unable to otherwise manage
changes in, or that affect, our workforce, which could impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or result in a loss of
sales, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. The terms and conditions of existing,
renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully
implement future operational changes to enhance our ef ficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy .
If we are not able to adequately protec t our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the intellectual property
rights of others, the value of our products or brands, or our competitive position, could be reduced, which could have an adverse
impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business. These intellectual property rights include ingredient
formulas, trademark s, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets that are important to our business and relate to
a variety of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment
used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark, copyright, patent
and trade secret laws, third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our
28
Table of Contents
intellectual property . If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and trade
secrets, including our ingredient formul as, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our
intellectual property , the value of our products and brands, or our competitive position, could be reduced and there could be an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if, in the course of developing new
products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others,
directly or indirectl y, such finding could have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of
operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products.
Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations could have an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We and our subsidia ries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations,
including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and
ingredients including sugar , sodium and saturated fat, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by
us of intellectual property rights of others, environmental, privacy , employment, tax and insurance matters and matters relating to
our compl iance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate such matters to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes
and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses and establish reserves as appropriate. These matters are inherently uncertain
and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselve s in these matters, or that our assessment of the
materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate
outcome of such matters. In the event that management’ s assessment of actual or potential claims and proceedings proves
inaccurate or litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries or investigations that are material arise in the future, there may be a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Responding to litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries,
and invest igations, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, may also require us to incur significant expense and devote
significant resources , and may generate  adverse publicity that may damage our reputation or brand image, which could have an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Many factors may adversely af fect the price of our publicly traded securities.
Many factors may adversely affect the price of our common stock and publicly traded debt. Such factors, some of which are
beyond our control, may include, but are not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; changes in financial or tax reporting and
changes in accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results; investor perceptions
of our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; actions  by shareholders or others seeking to influence our
business strategies; speculation by the media or investment community regarding our business, strategies and performance or those
of our competitors; developments relating to pending litigation, claims, inquiries or investigations; changes in laws and regulations
applicable to our products or business operations; trading activity in our securiti es or trading activity in derivative instruments with
respect to our secur ities; changes in our credit ratings; the impact of our share repurchase programs or dividend policy; and the
outcome of referend a and elections. In addition, corporate actions, such as those  we may or may not take from time to time as part
of our continuous review of our corpor ate structure and our strategy , including as a result of business, legal, regulatory and tax
considerations, may not have the impact we intend and may adversely affect the price of our securities. The above factors, as well
as the other risks included in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” could adversely af fect the price of our securities.

Item 3. Legal Pr oceedings.
As previously disclosed, in April 2017, Corporación Autónoma Regional de Cundinamarca, a Colombian environmental authority
(the envir onmental authority), initiated an administrative proceeding regardin g our subsidiary , PepsiCo Alimentos Z.F., Ltda.
(PAZ), for allegedly delivering wastewater to a third party without first verifying that the third party had appropriate permits with
respect to the dischar ge of such wastewater . In July 2018, the environmental authority initiated an administrative proceeding to
impose a monetary sanction against PAZ with respect to the alleged permitting violation by the third party , and on August 13, 2018,
PAZ submitted evidence of its defense to these allegations. If the environmental authority determines PAZ is responsible for the
alleged permitting violations by the third party , the environmental authority may seek to impose monetary sanctions of up to $1.3
million, which P AZ would be entitled to appeal.
In additio n, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claim s, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and
investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be
predicted with certainty , management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operation s or cash flows. Sanctions imposed by foreign authorities are levied in local currency and
disclosed using the U.S. dollar equival ent at the time of imposition and are subject to currency fluctuations. See also “Item 1.
Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

OUR BUSINESS
Executive Overview
We are a leading global food and beve rage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Frito-Lay , Gatorade,
Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we
make, market, distri bute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in
more than 200 countries and territories.
At PepsiC o, we are focused on an approach called Winning with Purpose that will help make our company faster , stronger and
better at meeting the needs of our customers, consumers, partners and communities, while caring for our planet and inspiring our
associates.
Our strategies are designed to address key challenges facing our Company , including: shifting consumer preferences and behaviors;
a highly competitive operating environm ent; a rapidly changing retail landscap e, including the growth in e-commerce; continued
macroeconomic and political volatility; and an evolving regulatory landscape.
We intend to focus on the following areas to address and adapt to these challenges:
•Winning in the marketplace and accelerating growth by strengthening and broadening our portfolio, while focusing on
locally meeting the needs of our consumers and customers;
•Continuing to implement our productiv ity initiatives to improve our operation al efficiency and enhance our competitive
advantage while continuing to transform our core capabilities with technolo gy and building and retaining a talented
workforce to drive cost savings; and
•Continuing to lead with purpose by focusing on our impact on the planet and our people, assisting in establishing a more
sustainable food system, minimizing our impact on the environment, protectin g human rights and securing supply while
positioning our Company for sustainable growth.
We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth.

Other Relationships
Certain members of our Board of Direc tors also serve on the boards of certain  vendors and customers. These Board members do
not partici pate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and
customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms  negotiated with other vendors and customers. In
addition, certain of our employees serve  on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo
and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.
Our Business Risks
We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During 2018  and 2017 , certain jurisdictions in which our products are
made, manufactured , distributed or sold operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and
social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, and currency fluctuations. We continue to monitor the
economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any
unfavorable impacts on our future results.
In addition, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are
considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their
packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the
production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverab ility of our packaging. These taxes and regulations
vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only
to beverag es with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of
packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging and encourage waste reduction and
increased recycling rates.
We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we
sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packag ing used varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we
cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitation s on our products or their packaging may take, and
therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations
and limita tions may impact us and our competitors differently . We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations
in the jurisdictions in which our produ cts are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to
potentially mitigate  the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative
measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.
In addition , our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through
e-commerce website s and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and
digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We continue to monitor changes in the retail
landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commer ce capabilities, distribute our products effectively
through all existing and emer ging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we
recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. In 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of
$28 million  in connec tion with the TCJ Act. See further information in “Items Affecting Comparability .” While our accountin g for
the record ed impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently
available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods.

consolidated financial statements.
See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks
and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.
Risk Management Framework
The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To
identify , assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’ s operations, we leverage an
integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:
•PepsiCo’ s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’ s integrated risk management framework. One of the
Board’ s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the
Company’ s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’ s top risks. The Board receives updates
on key risks throughout the year, inclu ding risks related to cybersecurity . In addition, the Board has tasked designated
Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk manageme nt, and the Committees report to the Board
regularly on these matters.
◦The Audit  Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’ s risk
management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’ s oversight of financial, compliance and employee
safety risks facing PepsiCo;
◦The Comp ensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’ s employee compensation policies and practices to
assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;
◦The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’ s
governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and
◦The Public Policy and Sustainability Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’ s
policies, programs and related risks that concern key public policy and sustainability matters.

Market Risks
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal cours e of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the
identification and effective implementat ion of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives.
Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See “Item 1A. Risk
Factors” for further discussion of our market risks, and see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information on our
non-cancelable purchasing commitments.
The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market
fluctuations is discussed below . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and
our hedgin g policies . See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical
plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.
Inflationary , deflationary and recessiona ry conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our
products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.
Commodity Prices
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion  as of December 29, 2018  and $0.9 billion  as of December 30,
2017 . At the end of 2018 , the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the
underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2018  by $100 million .
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our consolidated  net revenue in 2018 , with Mexico, Russia, Canada,
the United Kingdom and Brazil  comprisin g approx imately 20% of our consolidated  net revenue in 2018 . As a result, we are
exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold.
During 2018 , unfavora ble foreig n exchange reduced net revenue growth by one percentage point due to declines in the Russian
ruble, Turkish lira and Brazilian real. Currency declines against the U.S. dolla r which are not offset could adversely impact our
future financial results.
In addition , volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made,
manufactured, distri buted or sold, inclu ding in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey , and
currency fluctuations in certain of these international markets continue to result in challenging operating environments. We also
continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’ s pending withdrawal from the
European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as
well as the economi c, operating and political environment in Russia, and the potential impact for the ESSA segment and our other
businesses.
Our foreig n currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.0 billion  as of December 29, 2018  and $1.6 billion as of
December 30, 2017 . The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net
47
Table of Contents
investment hedges was $0.9 billion  as of December 29, 2018  and $1.5 billion  as of December 30, 2017 . At the end of 2018 , we
estimate that an unfavorable 10% chang e in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2018
by $149 million .
Inter est Rates
Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $10.5 billion  as of December 29, 2018  and $14.2 billion  as of
December 30, 2017 . Assuming year-end 2018  investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest
rates woul d have increased our net interest expense in 2018  by $7 million  due to lower cash and cash equivalents  and short-term
investments levels as compared with our variable rate debt.

OUR FINANCIAL RESUL TS
Results of Operations — Consolidated Review
In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below , “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over -year impact of discrete
pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different
countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over -year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package,
discounts and allowances. Additionally , “acquisitions and divestitures,” except as otherwise noted, reflect all mergers and
acquisitions activity , including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated
subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.
Volume
Our beverage volume in the NAB, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segmen ts reflects sales to authorized bottlers, independent
distributors and retailers, as well as the sale of beverages bearing Company-o wned or licensed trademarks that have been sold
through our authorized independent bottlers. Bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not
necessarily equal during any given period due to seasonality , timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices
and other factors. While our beverage revenues are not entirely based on BCS volume, as there are independent bottlers in the
supply chain, we believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our beverage products at the consumer
level. Sales of products from our unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected in our reported volume. NAB, Latin America, ESSA
and AMENA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea
products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name) , and NAB, either independently or in conjunction
with third  parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In
addition, AMENA licenses the Tropica na brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic
alliance with T ingyi.
Our food and snack volume in the FLNA, QFNA, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments is reported on a system-wide basis,
which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled affiliates  of snacks bearing Company-owned or licensed
trademarks.
Servings
Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common
servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are
converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.
In 2018 , total servings incre ased 1% compared to 2017 . In 2017 , total servings decreased 1% compared to 2016 . Excluding the
impact of the 53rd reporting week in 2016, total servings in 2017 was even with the prior year. Servings growth reflects adjustments
to the prior year results for divestitures and other structural changes.

See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.
2018
Operating profit decreased 2% and operating profit margin declined 0.5 percentage points. The operating profit performance was
driven by certain operating cost increases and a 6-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by
productivity savings of more than $1 billion and net revenue growth.
The impact of refran chising a portion of our beverage business in Jordan in 2017 and a prior -year gain associated with the sale of
our minori ty stake in Britvic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2.5 percentage points. These impacts were offset
by a 2-percentage-p oint positive impact of refranchising a portion of our beve rage business in Thailand and our entire beverage
bottling operations and snack distribu tion operations in CHS in 2018. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting
Comparability”) negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points and decreased operating profit margin by
0.5 percentage points, primarily due to higher mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives included in corporate
unallocated expenses.
2017
Operating profit increased 5% and operating profit margin improved 0.6 percen tage points. Operating profit growth was driven by
productivity savings of more than $1 billion and effective net pricing, partial ly offset by certain operating cost increases, a 7-
percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange.
The impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Jordan and a gain associated with the sale of our minority stake in
Britvic each contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting
Comparability”) also contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth and increased operating profit margin by 0.2
percentage points, primarily reflecting a prior -year impairment charge to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in
KSFB to its estimated fair value.

2018
Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $65 million , reflecting the impact of the $1.4 billion discretionary
pension contribution to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States, as well as the recognition of net
asset gains, partially of fset by higher amortization of net losses.
Net intere st expense increased $312 million reflecting a charge of $253 million in connection with our cash tender and exchange
offers, prim arily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. This increase also reflects higher
interest rates on debt balances, as well as losses on the market value of investm ents used to economically hedge a portion of our
deferred compensation liability . These impacts were partially offset by higher interest income due to higher interest rates on cash
balances.
The reported tax rate decreased 85.6 percentage points, reflecting both other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our
international operations, which reduced the reported tax rate by 45 percentage points, and the prior year provisional net tax expense
related to the TCJ Act, which reduced  the current year reported tax rate by 25 percentage points. Additionally , the favorable
conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of
taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively , reduced the reported tax rate by 7 percentage points.  See Note  5 to our consolidated
financial statements for further information.

Table of Contents
Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 158%  and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 160% .
Items affecting comparability (see “Item s Affecting Comparability”) positively contributed 150 percentage points to net income
attributable to PepsiCo growth and 152 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth.
2017
Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $252 million , primarily reflecting a settlement charge of $242 million
related to the purchase of a group annuity contract in 2016.
Net interest expense decreased $325 million  reflecting  a charge of $233 million in 2016 representing the premium paid in
accordance with the “make-whole” redemption provisions to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and
5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively . This decrease also reflects
higher interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances, as well as gains on the market value of investments
used to economicall y hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability . These impacts were partially offset by higher interest
expense due to higher average debt balances.
The reported tax rate increased 23.5 percentage points primarily as a result of the provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ
Act, which contributed 26 percentage points to the increase, partially offset by the impact of the 2016 impairment charge to reduce
the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in KSFB to its estimated fair value, which had no corresponding tax benefit, as well as
the impact of recogn izing excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as a result of the changes in accounting for certain
aspects of share-ba sed payments to employees in 2017. See Note 2 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for
additional information.
Net income attributable to PepsiCo and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share both decreased 23%. Items affecting
comparability (see “Items Affecting Com parability”) negatively impacted both net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and
net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance by 30 percen tage points, primarily as a result of the provisional
net tax expense related to the TCJ Act.
Non-GAAP Measur es
Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Princi ples (GAAP). We use non-GAAP  financial measures internally to make operating and
strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a
factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K
provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating
results, and provide s additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this
Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business
performance and trends.
We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that
could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performan ce or trends. Examples of items for which we may
make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring programs;
charges or adjustme nts related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts
related to the resolution of tax positions ; tax benefits related to reorganizations  of our operations; gains or losses associated with
mergers, acquisition s, divestitures and other structural changes; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; pension and
retiree medical related items; asset impairments (non-cash); and

remeasurements of net monetary assets.  See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustm ents to our
U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. 
Non-GAAP informa tion should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP . In addition, our non-GAAP financial
measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.
The following non-GAAP financial measures are contained in this Form 10-K:
•cost of sales, gross  profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits
income/expense, interest expense, benef it from/provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interests, each adjusted for

•organic revenue growth;
•free cash flow; and
•return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items af fecting comparability .

Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Shar e – Diluted, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability , and the Corr esponding Constant
Curr ency Gr owth Rates
These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not
qualify for hedge accounting, restructur ing and impairment charges related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans, merger and
integration char ges associated with our acquisition of SodaStream, net tax benefit/expense associated with the enactment of the TCJ
Act, other net tax benefits, charges related to cash tender and exchange offers, a charge related to the transaction with Tingyi, a
charge related to debt redemption, and a pension-related settlement charge (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed
description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability ,
and net income attributable to PepsiCo  per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability , on a constant
currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based
on the rates in effect for the comparable  prior -year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide,
as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide,
as appropriate, those amounts by the prior -year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful
information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing
performance. We are not able to reconci le our full year projected 2019  annual tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability , to
our full year projected 2019  reported annual tax rate because we are unable to predict the 2019  impact of foreign exchange or the
mark-to-market net impact on commod ity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and
commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of this measure.
Organic Revenue Gr owth
We define  organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the
impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. Our 2018 reported results reflect the accounting policy election
taken in conjunction with the adoption of the revenue
53
Table of Contents
recognition guidanc e to exclude from net revenue and cost of sales all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by
governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions not already excluded. Our 2018 organic revenue growth excludes the
impact of approxim ately $75 million of these taxes previously recognized in net revenue. In addition, our fiscal 2016 reported
results included an extra week of results. Our 2017 organic revenue growth excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week from
our 2016 results.
We believe organic revenue provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we
believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year .
See “Net Revenue and Or ganic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review .”
Free Cash Flow
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property , plant and
equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,
we believe  that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe  investors should also consider net capital spending
when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt
repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since
we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.
See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
ROIC and Net ROIC, Excluding Items Affecting Comparability
We define  ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt
obligations and quarterly average comm on shareholders’ equity . Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods
exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly , the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other
companies use to calculate their ROIC.
We believ e this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC,
excluding items affecting comparability , to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it
removes from our operating results the impact of items that are not indicati ve of our ongoing performance and reflects how
management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , as ROIC,
adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting
comparability . We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability , provides useful
information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital
allocation ef ficiency .
See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Mark-to-Market Net Impact
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural
products and metals . Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period
with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and
administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division
results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the
economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in corporate
unallocated expenses.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges
2019 Multi-Y ear Pr oductivity Plan
Our 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to
further simplify , harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying
the right automation for each market; simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In
connection with this program, we expec t to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, of which $138 million is included
in our 2018 results, approximately $800  million is expected to be reflected in our 2019 results and the balance to be reflected in our
2020 through 2023 results. These pre-tax  charges will consist of approximately 70% of severance and other employee-related costs,
15% for asset impai rments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15% for other costs associated with
the implementation of our initiatives. We expect that these pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures of approximately $1.6
billion, of which we expect approximately $450 million to be reflected in our 2019 cash flows and the balance to be reflected in our
2020 through 2023 cash flows. We expect to incur the majority of the pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2019 and 2020
results.

To build on the successful implementation of the 2014 Productivity Plan, we expanded and extended the program through the end

beverage, food and snack businesses. In connection with this program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of
approximately $1.3 billion and $960 million, respectively . This total pre-tax charge is expected to consist of approximately 55% of
severance and other employee-related costs, 15% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related
actions, and 30% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initia tives. To date, we have incurred $1.2 billion of pre-
tax charges and $814 million of cash expenditures. We expect to complete the program and incur the program’ s remaining pre-tax
charges and cash expenditures before the end of 2019.
The total expected program pre-tax char ges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:
 FLNA  QFNA  NAB  Latin America ESSA  AMENA  Corporate
Expected pre-tax charges 14% 3% 30% 15% 20% 6% 12%
See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans.
We regularly evaluate productivity initia tives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to
our consolidated financial statements.
Merger and Integration Charges
In 2018, we incurre d merger and integ ration charges of $75 million ($0.05 per share) related to our acquisition of SodaStream,
including $57 million recorded in the ESSA segment and $18 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses. These charges
include closing costs, advisory fees and employee-related costs .
See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
Net T ax (Benefit)/Expense Related to the TCJ Act
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States . Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed
a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from
35% to 21%, ef fective January 1, 2018. 
In 2017, we recorded a provi sional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ($1.70 per share) associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act.
Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion was a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4
billion on undistribu ted international earnings, included in other liabilities. This mandatory one-time transition tax was partially
offset by a provision al $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the
new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate.
In 2018, we recorded a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) in connection with the TCJ Act.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.

Other Net T ax Benefits
In 2018, we reorganized our internation al operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result,
we recogn ized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion ($3.05 per share). Also in 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits associated
with both the conclu sion of certain international tax audits and our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the
audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS resulted in
non-cash tax benefits of $364 million ($0.26 per share) and $353 million ($0.24 per share), respectively .
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
Charges Related to Cash T ender and Exchange Of fers
In 2018, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253 million  ($191 million after-tax or $0.13 per share) to interest expense in connection
with our cash tender and exchange of fers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
Charge Related to the T ransaction with T ingyi
In 2016, we recorde d a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million ($0.26 per share) in the AMENA segment to reduce
the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in KSFB to its estimated fair valu e. 
See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
Charge Related to Debt Redemption
In 2016, we paid $2.5 billion to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for
the princip al amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively , and terminated certain interest rate swaps. As a result, we
recorded a pre-tax charge of $233 million ($156 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) to interest expense, primarily representing the
premium paid in accordance with the “make-whole” redemption provisions.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
Pension-Related Settlement Charge
In 2016, we recorde d a pre-tax pension settlement charge in corporate unallocat ed expenses of $242 million ($162 million after-tax
or $0.1 1 per share) related to the purchase of a group annuity contract.

2018
Net revenue declined 1.5% and volume declined 0.5%. The net revenue perform ance reflects unfavorable net pricing and mix and
the volume decline. The volume decline  was driven by a double-digit decline in trademark Gamesa and a mid-single-digit decline
in ready-to-eat cereals, partially of fset by mid-single-digit growth in oatmeal.
Operating profit decreased slightly , reflecting certain operating cost increases, the net revenue performance and a 3-percentage-

2018
Net revenue grew 1%, driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume. Volume decreased 1%, driven by a
3% decline in CSD volume, partially offset by a 2% increase in non-carbonate d beverage volume. The non-carbonated beverage
volume increase primarily reflected a high-single-digit increase in our overa ll water portfolio. Additionally , a low-single-digit
increase in Gatorade sports drinks was of fset by a low-single-digit decline in our juice and juice drinks portfolio.
Operating profit decreased 16%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including increased transportation costs, a 7-
percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially
offset by productivit y savings and the net revenue growth. Higher gains on asset sales positively contributed 1.5 percentage points
to operating profit performance. A bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act negatively impacted
operating profit performance by 1.5 percentage points and was partially offset by prior -year costs related to hurricanes which
positively contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit performance.

Our Liquidity and Capital Resour ces
We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities and other
available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet
our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated
share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments and transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations,
proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
However , there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credi t markets will not impair our ability to access these
markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of
our credit facilities. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for further discussion.
As of December 29, 2018 , we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash in our consolidated
subsidiaries of $5.7 billion outside the United States. The restricted cash of approximately $2.0 billion held outside the United
States relates to our acquisition of Soda Stream. Refer to Note 13 to our consoli dated financial statements for further discussion of
restricted cash. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9
billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 29, 2018, our
mandatory transition tax liability is $3.8 billion. Under the provisions of the TCJ Act, this transition tax liability must be paid over
eight years; we currently expect to pay approximately $0.4 billion of this liabili ty in 2019 and the remainder over the period 2020
to 2026.  See “Credit Facilities and Long-T erm Contractual Commitments.” While our accounting for the recorded impact of the
TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, this amount is based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any
additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amount in future periods. The IRS issued additional
guidance in the first quarter of 2019 and we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance.
In connection with the TCJ Act, during 2018 we repatriated $20.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held
in our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. federal income tax liability . The repatriated cash was
used primarily for repayment of commercial paper and to fund discretionary benefit plan contributions, debt repayments, dividend
payments, share repurchases and our acquisition of SodaStream. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks,” “Items
Affecting Comparability ,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies,” as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
As of December 29, 2018 , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidi aries subject to currency
controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.
Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality . Working capital needs are impacted
by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to season al and holiday-related sales patterns, and generally
lowest in the first quarter . On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our
business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency
initiatives, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Operating Activities
During 2018 , net cash provided by operating activities was $9.4 billion , compared to $10.0 billion  in the prior year. The operating
cash flow performan ce primarily reflects the discretionary contributions of $1.5 billion to our pension and retiree medical plans in
the current year , partially of fset by lower net cash tax payments in the current year .
During 2017 , net cash provided by operating activities was $10 billion , compared to $10.7 billion  in 2016. The operating cash flow
performance primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons to 2016. This decrease is mainly due to higher current year
payments to vendors and customers, coupled with higher net cash tax payme nts in 2017, partially offset by lower pension and
retiree medical plan contributions in 2017.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of pension contributions.
Investing Activities
During 2018 , net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 billion , primarily reflecting net maturities and sales of debt
securities with maturities greater than three months of $8.7 billion, partially offset by net capital spending of $3.1 billion and $1.2
billion of cash paid, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream.
During 2017 , net cash used for investing activities was $4.4 billion , prim arily reflecting net capital spendin g of $2.8 billion and net
purchases of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $1.9 billion.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financ ial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities.
We expect 2019  net capital spending to be approximately $4.5 billion .
Financing Activities
During 2018 , net cash used for financing activities was $13.8 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our
shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.9 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $4.0
billion, cash tender and exchange of fers of $1.6 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $1.4 billion.
During 2017 , net cash used for financing activities was $4.2 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our
shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.5 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $1.1
billion, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $3.1 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.5
billion.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.
We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including  our dividend policy and share repurchase activity .
On Februa ry 11, 2015, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $12.0 billion of PepsiCo
common stock which commenced on July 1, 2015 and expired on June 30, 2018 (2015 share repurchase program). The 2015 share
repurchase program had approximately $4.3 billion of authorized repurchase capacity unused at expiration. On February 13, 2018,
we announced the 2018 share repurcha se program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock
which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. On February 15, 2019, we announced a 3% increase in our
annualized dividend to $3.82 per share from $3.71 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2019. We
expect to return a total of approximately $8 billion to shareholders in 2019 through share repurchases of approximately $3 billion
and dividends of approximately $5 billion.

(a)See “Non-GAAP Measures.” In addition, when evaluating free cash flow, we also consider the following items impacting comparability: $1.5 billion, $6 million and $459 million in
discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions and associated net cash tax benefits of $473 million, $1 million and $151 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively; $266
million, $113 million and $125 million of payments related to restructuring charges and associated net cash tax benefits of $45 million, $30 million and $22 million in 2018, 2017
and 2016, respectively; tax payments related to the TCJ Act of $115 million in 2018; certain other items of $47 million in 2018; net cash tax benefit related to debt redemption
charge of $83 million in 2016; and net cash received related to interest rate swaps of $5 million in 2016. We will also consider payments related to the transition tax liability of $3.8
billion as of December 29, 2018, which we currently expect to be paid over the period 2019 to 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act, as an item impacting comparability.
We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to
continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial
paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets
at favorab le interest rates. However , see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our
credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
Any down grade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not
as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increas e our future borrowing costs and impair our ability
to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current
short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have
experienced historic ally, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more  expensive types of debt financing. See “Item 1A.
Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

(a)Based on year-end foreign exchange rates. Reserves for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or
timing of any such settlements. However, under the provisions of the TCJ Act, our transition tax liability of $3.8 billion, of which $3.4 billion is recorded in other liabilities on our
balance sheet, must be paid over eight years. We expect to pay approximately $0.4 billion in 2019, $0.3 billion per year in 2020-2023, $0.6 billion in 2024, $0.7 billion in 2025 and
$0.9 billion in 2026 and these amounts are excluded from the table above.

Long-term contractu al commitments, except for our long-term debt obligati ons and transition tax liability , are generally not
recorded on our balance sheet. Operatin g leases primarily represent building leases. Non-cancelable purchasing commitments are
primarily for oranges, orange juice and certain other commodities. Non-cancelab le marketing commitments are primarily for sports
marketing. Bottler funding to independe nt bottlers is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on
an annual  basis. Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans  are not reflected in our long-term contractual
commitments. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension and retiree
medical obligations.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
We do not have guarantees or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe
could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity .
We coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including sweeteners, aluminum cans
and plastic  bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers
order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly . Consequently , transactions between our
independent bottlers  and suppliers are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party , we could be
liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our independent bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote.

OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
An apprec iation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require
management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly
impact our financia l results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of
underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical plans, our critical
accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting. We applied our critical accounting policies
and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting
policies with our Audit Committee.
71
Table of Contents
Our critical accounting policies are:
•revenue recognition;
•goodwill and other intangible assets;
•income tax expense and accruals; and
•pension and retiree medical plans.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales
of beverag e products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipmen t or delivery of products to our customers, which is
also when  control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that
do not allow for a right of return. Howe ver, our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and
out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly ,
our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record
reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days
internationally , and may allow discounts for early payment.
We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility , the aging of
accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data.
Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to
regulate the quantity of product shipped  or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with
customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we
monitor customer inventory levels.
As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to
customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incen tives, discounts, advertising and other marketing
activities. Sales incentives and discount s are primarily accounted for as a reduc tion of revenue and include payments to customers
for performing activities on our behalf , such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products,
payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided
to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financi al statements for additional information on our revenue recognition and related policies,
including total marketplace spending.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were develop ed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as
incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first
assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any
excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estim ates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a
number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and
future
72
Table of Contents
expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
We believe that a brand has an indefinite  life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent
and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not
met, brand s are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected
life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation  of a number of factors, including market share,
consumer awareness, brand history , future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic
environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.
In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights
to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights,
many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these
franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these
franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these
franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the
remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually ,
using eithe r a qualitative or quantitative  approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter . Where we use the
qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists.
Factors considered include macroecono mic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical
financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more
likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment, estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several
estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates,
perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based
on market  data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive
operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used
in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of
capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These
assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.”
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated
fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
Income T ax Expense and Accruals
Our annua l tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various
jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determi ning our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax
positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain
positions are subject to challenge and that we likely
73
Table of Contents
will not succeed. We adjust these reserv es, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
progress of a tax audit. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.
An estima ted annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item
recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time
as that item. W e consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be among such items.
Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As
a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate).
Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse
over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already
recorded the tax benefit on our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax
liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statement s for which payment has been deferred, or expense
for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States . Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed
a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from
35% to 21%, ef fective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment
of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ($1.70 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion recognized in 2017 is a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of
approximately $4 billion on undistribute d international earnings, included in other liabilities. This provisional mandatory one-time
transition tax was partially of fset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, effective  January 1, 2018. The effect of the remeasurement
was record ed in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act and reflected in our provision for
income taxes.
During 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $28 million  ($0.02 per share) in connection with the TCJ Act. See further
information in “Items Af fecting Comparability .”
While our accountin g for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing
regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned
amounts in future periods.  As a result of the TCJ Act, we currently expect our annual tax rate, excluding items affecting
comparability , in percentage terms, to be in the low twenties in 2019. However , we continue to evaluate the impact of the TCJ Act
on our annual tax rate due to certain provisions, such as the global intangible low-tax income (GIL TI) provision, which may impact
our tax rate in future years.
In 2018 , our annual tax rate was (36.7)%  compared to 48.9%  in 2017 , as discussed in “Other Consolidated Results.” The tax rate
decreased 85.6 percentag e points compared to 2017, reflecting both other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our
international operations, which reduced the reported tax rate by 45 percentage points, and the prior year provisional net tax expense
related to the TCJ Act, which reduced  the current year reported tax rate by 25 percentage points. Additionally , the favorable
conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of
74
Table of Contents
taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively , reduced the reported tax rate by 7 percentage points.  See Note  5 to our consolidated
financial statements.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Plans
Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based
on either years of service or a combinat ion of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for
medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally , our share of retiree
medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the
remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.
In 2016, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the combination
of two plans effective December 31, 2016, and the spinof f of a portion of the combined plan into a pre-existing plan effective
January 1, 2017. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged.  The result of the reorganization was the creation of
Plan A and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment
strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility . Actuarial gains and
losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining servic e life of the active participants, while the actuarial
gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of
these chan ges, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $42 million ($27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for
the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. See Note 7 to our consolidated
financial statements.
In 2016, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance
company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments  for certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary
contributions of $452 million primarily to fund the transfer of the obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge
of $242 million ($162 million after-tax or $0.11 per share). See “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated
financial statements.
Our Assumptions
The determ ination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount
of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical
expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the
year (servi ce cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains
and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our
funded plans.
Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:
•certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover , retirement age and mortality;
•the expected return on assets in our funded plans;
•for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings;
•for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates; and
•for pensio n and retiree medical expense , the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs
and the present value of liabilities.
75
Table of Contents
Certain assumptions  reflect our historica l experience and management’ s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial
assumptions are reviewed annually , except in the case of an interim remeasurem ent due to a significant event such as a curtailment
or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the
measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.
At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality , long-term corporate debt securities with
maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the
discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and
amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.
See Note 7 to our consolidated financia l statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’
investment strategy . Although we review  our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year
do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.
The health  care trend rate used to deter mine our retiree medical plans’ liability and expense is reviewed annually . Our review is
based on our claims  experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care
industry . Our review  of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes
in medical carriers.
Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:  
 2019  2018  2017
Pension      
Service cost discount rate 4.4% 3.7% 4.3%
Interest cost discount rate 3.9% 3.2% 3.5%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.8% 6.9% 7.2%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.2% 3.2% 3.2%
Retiree medical      
Service cost discount rate 4.3% 3.6% 4.0%
Interest cost discount rate 3.8% 3.0% 3.2%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.6% 6.5% 7.5%
Current health care cost trend rate 5.7% 5.8% 5.9%
Based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to increase in 2019  primarily driven by the
recognition of prior experience losses  on return on plan assets, partially offset by the impact of higher discount rates and
discretionary plan contributions.
Sensitivity of Assumptions
A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our
benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrea se in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would
individually increase 2019  pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:
Assumption  Amount
Discount rates used in the calculation of expense  $42
Expected rate of return  $40

Funding
We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in
accordance with applicable tax regula tions that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the
employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally , we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be
currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulat ory funding requirements, we generally fund these
plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these
benefits.
Our pensio n and retiree medical contrib utions are subject to change as a result  of many factors, such as changes in interest rates,
deviations between actual and expected  asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different
opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated
financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 — Basis of Pr esentation and Our Divisions
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts
of PepsiCo , Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the
equity method based on our economic  ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or
financial decisions of these af filiates or our ability to direct their economic resources. W e do not control these other af filiates, as our
ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of
exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our
Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.
Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production
planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and
delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in
determining, among  other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical
accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows  associated with impairment testing for perpetual
brands, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well
as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our
estimates as circums tances change. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ
significantly from these estimates.
Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturda y of each December , resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. Our
fiscal 2016 results included an extra week. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, most of our
international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. Certain operations in our ESSA segment report on a weekly calendar
basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule:
Quarter  United States and Canada  International
First Quarter  12 weeks  January , February
Second Quarter  12 weeks  March, April and May
Third Quarter  12 weeks  June, July and August
Fourth Quarter  16 weeks (17 weeks for 2016)  September , October , November and December
See “Our Divisions” below , and for additional unaudited information on items affecting the comparability of our consolidated
results, see further unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amoun ts. All per share amounts reflect common per share
amounts, assume dilution unless otherw ise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the
prior years’ financial statements to conform to the current year presentation, including the adoption of the recently issued
accounting pronouncements disclosed in Note 2.

Our Divisions
Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a
wide varie ty of convenient beverages,  foods and snacks, serving customers  and consumers in more than 200 countries and
territories with our largest operations in North America, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Division results are based
on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to our divisions and are considered our
reportable segments. For additional unaudited information on our divisions, see “Our Operations” contained in “Item 1. Business.”
The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described  in Note 2, except for the following allocation
methodologies:
•share-based compensation expense;
•pension and retiree medical expense; and
•derivatives.
Share-Based Compensation Expense
Our divisi ons are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions
as an incremental employee compensation cost.
The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows:
 2018 2017 2016
FLNA 13% 13% 14%
QFNA 1% 1% 2%
NAB 18% 18% 22%
Latin America 8% 7% 7%
ESSA 9% 9% 11%
AMENA 8% 9% 10%
Corporate unallocated expenses 43% 43% 34%
The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market
conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual
expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.
Pension and Retir ee Medical Expense
Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between
the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is
reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.
Derivatives
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural
products and metals . Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period
with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and
administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division
results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the
economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility , which remains in corporate
unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative
purposes.

 $ 64,661 $ 63,525 $ 62,799 $ 10,110 $ 10,276 $ 9,804
(a) Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products to our customers, each comprising approximately 50%
of our consolidated net revenue. Internationally , our Latin America segment is predominantly a food and snack business, ESSA ’s beverage business and food and snack
business are each approximately 50% of the segment’ s net revenue and AMENA ’s beverage business and food and snack business are appro ximately 35% and 65%,
respectively , of the segmen t’s net revenue. Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which prim arily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our NAB
and ESSA segments, is approximately 40% of our conso lidated net revenue. Generally , our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower
operating mar gins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. See Note 2 for additional information.
(b) For further unaudited information on certain items that impacted our financial performance, see “Item 6. Selected Financial Data.”
(c) Reflects the retrospective adoption of guidance requi ring the presentation of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost below operating profit. See Note 2
for additional information.
Corporate Unallocated Expenses
Corporate unallocated expenses includ e costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as commodity
derivative gains and losses, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our ongoing business transformation initiatives,
unallocated research and development costs, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, and certain other items.

(b) Corporate assets consist principally of certain cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, derivative instruments, property , plant and equipment and
tax assets. In 2018 , the change in assets was primarily due to a decreas e in short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. Refer to the cash flow statement for

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales
of beverag e products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipmen t or delivery of products to our customers, which is
also when  control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are
accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts.
The transfer of contr ol of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.
However , our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store
shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly , our policy for certain warehouse-
distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for
anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
In additio n, upon adoption of the revenue recognition guidance (see subsequent discussion of “Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements - Adopted”), we exclude from net revenue and cost of sales, all sales,
86
Table of Contents
use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions.
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days
internationally , and may allow discounts for early payment.
We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility , the aging of
accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general and administrative
expenses on our income statement.
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, includ ing Walmart. In 2018 , sales to Walmart (including
Sam’ s) represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers,
which were used in finished goods sold by them to W almart. W e have not experienced credit issues with these customers.
Total Marketplace Spending
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending
includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily
accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers  for performing activities on our behalf, such as
payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote
lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of
advertising and other marketing activities.
A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers  and customer volume rebates, are based on annual
targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. These accruals are based on contract terms and our
historical experience  with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation
and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are
recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also
based on annual tar gets and recognized during the year as incurred.
The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year, and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term
estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers
under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue,
and the remaining balances of $218 million  as of December 29, 2018  and $262 million  as of December 30, 2017  are includ ed in
prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet . For additional unaudited information on our sales
incentives, see “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business.”
For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our
interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted
sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’ s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our
forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes
in estimate s and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginn ing in the interim period that they are identified. In
addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing
activities. Our annual financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology .

Table of Contents
Advertising and other marketing activit ies, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.2 billion  in 2018 ,
$4.1 billion  in 2017  and $4.2 billion  in 2016 , including  advertising expenses of $2.6 billion  in 2018 , $2.4 billion  in 2017  and $2.5
billion  in 2016 . Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:
•media and personal service prepayments;
•promotional materials in inventory; and
•production costs of future media advertising.
Deferred advertising costs of $47 million  and $46 million  as of December 29, 2018  and December 30, 2017 , respectively , are
classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.
Distribution Costs
Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are
reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $10.5 billion  in 2018 , $9.9 billion  in
2017  and $9.7 billion  in 2016 .
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Software Costs
We capita lize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining
computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be
used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or
obtaining computer software, (ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software
projects and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in
property , plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the
estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $204 million  in 2018 ,
$224 million  in 2017  and $214 million  in 2016 . Net capitalized software and development costs were $577 million  and $686
million  as of December 29, 2018  and December 30, 2017 , respectively .
Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as
commitments under  contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments
when a loss is proba ble and estimable. For additional unaudited information on our commitments, see “Our Liquidity and Capital
Resources” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Research and Development
We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation
globally . Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and
development costs were $680 million , $737 million  and $ 760 million  in 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively , and are reported within
selling, general and administrative expenses.
See “Research and Development” in “Item 1. Business” for additional unaudited information about our research and development
activities.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually ,
using eithe r a qualitative or quantitative  approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter . Where we use the
qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists.
Factors considered include macroecono mic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical
financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more
likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
In the quantitative assessment of indefin ite lived-intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair
value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively . Estimated fair value is determined using
discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with
management’ s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions
underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management
judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeco nomic and other factors to estimate future levels of
sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and
goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information
and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assump tions could be adversely impacted by certain of the
risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated
fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
See also Note 4, and for additional unaudited information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see “Our Critical Accounting
Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted
In 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to retrospectively present the service cost component
of net periodic bene fit cost for pension  and retiree medical plans along with other compensation costs in operating profit and
present the other components of net periodic benefit cost separately below operating profit in the income statement. The guidance
also allows only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within inventory or fixed
assets on a prospecti ve basis. We adopte d the provisions of this guidance retrospectively in the first quarter of 2018, using historical
information previou sly disclosed in our pension and retiree medical benefits footnote as the estimation basis. We also updated our
allocation of service costs to our divisions to better approximate actual service cost. The impact from retrospective adoption of this
guidance resulted in an increase to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses of $11 million  and $222 million ,
respectively , for the year ended December 30, 2017 and an increase of $13 million  and a decrease of $32 million , respectively , for
the year ended December 31, 2016. W e recorded a corresponding increase of $233 million  and decrease of $19 million  for the years
ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively , to other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense)
below operating profit.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
(b) Includes restructuring charges of $5 million , including $1 million  in our FLNA segment, $2 million  in our NAB segment and $2 million  in corporate unallocated
expenses. See “Items Af fecting Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The changes described above had no impact on our consolidated net revenue, net income or earnings per share. See Note 7 for
further information on our service cost and other components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance to clarify how restricted cash should be presented in the cash flow statement. We adopted the
provisions of this guidance retrospectively during the first quarter of 2018; the adoption did not have a material impact on our
financial statements and primarily relate d to collateral posted against our derivative asset or liability positions. See Note 9 and Note
13 for further information.
90
Table of Contents
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to account for the income tax effects of intercompany transfers of
assets, other than inventory , when the transfer occurs versus deferring income  tax effects until the transferred asset is sold to an
outside party or otherwise recognized. We adopted the provisions of this guidance during the first quarter of 2018; the adoption did
not have a material impact on our financial statements and we recorded an adjustment of $8 million  to beginning retained earnings.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to measure investments in certain equity securities at fair value and
recognize any changes in fair value in net income. We adopted the provisions of this guidance during the first quarter of 2018; the
adoption did not have an impact on our financial statements. See Note 9 for further information on our investments in equity
securities.
In 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition, with final amendments issued in 2016. The guidance provides for a
five-step model to determine the revenue recognized for the transfer of goods or services to customers that reflects the expected
entitled consideration in exchange for those goods or services. It also provides clarification for principal versus agent
considerations and identifying performance obligations. In addition, the F ASB introduced practical expedients related to disclosures
of remaining performance obligations, as well as other amendments related to guidance on collectibility , non-cash consideration
and the presentation  of sales and other similar taxes. Financial statement disclo sures required under the guidance will enable users
to understand the nature, amount, timing, judgments and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. The
two permitted transition methods under the guidance are the full retrospective approach or a cumulative effect adjustment to the
opening retained earnings in the year of adoption (cumulative effect approach) . We adopted the guidance applied to all contracts
using the cumulative effect approach during the first quarter of 2018; the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.
We utilized a comp rehensive approach to assess the impact of the guidance on our contract portfolio by reviewing our current
accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the new requirements to our
revenue contracts, including evaluation of our performance obligations, principal versus agent considerations and variable
consideration. We completed our contract and business process reviews and implemented changes to our controls and disclosures
under the new guidance.
As a resul t of the implementation of the guidance, which did not have a materia l impact on our accounting policies upon adoption,
in the first quarter of 2018, we recorded an adjustment of $137 million  to beginning retained earnings to reflect marketplace
spending that our customers and independent bottlers expect to be entitled to in line with revenue recognition. In addition, we
excluded from net revenue and cost of sales all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental
authorities on revenue-producing transactions that were not already excluded. The impact of these taxes previously recognized in
net revenue and cost of sales was approximately $75 million  for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017, with no impact on
operating profit.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Y et Adopted
In 2018, the FASB issued guidance related to the TCJ Act for the optional reclassification of the residual tax effects, arising from
the change in corporate tax rate, in accum ulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. The reclassification is the difference
between the amount previously recorded in other comprehensive income at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in
accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the TCJ Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using
the newly enacted rate. If elected, the guidance can be applied retrospectively to each period during which the impact of the TCJ
Act is recognized or in the period of adoption. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2019,
but we are not planning to make the optional reclassification.
91
Table of Contents
In 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance to better portray the
economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance expands the ability to hedge nonfinancial
and financial risk components, reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminates the requirement to separately
measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, as well as eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. Under this
guidance, certain of our derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that did not previously qualify for hedge accounting
treatment will qualify prospectively . We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2019. The
guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures. See Note 9 for further information.
In 2016, the FASB issued guidance on leases, with amendments issued in 2018 . The guidance requires lessees to recognize most
leases on the balanc e sheet but record expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, the
guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The two permitted
transition methods under the guidance are the modified retrospective transi tion approach, which requires application of the
guidance for all comparative periods presented, and the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires prospective
application at the adoption date.
We contin ue to utilize a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and related
disclosures, including the increase in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the impact on our current lease portfolio
from both a lessor and lessee perspective. We are substantially complete with our comprehensive review of our lease portfolio
including significant leases by geography and by asset type that will be impacted by the new guidance, and enhancing our controls.
In addition , we are progressing on the implementation of a new software platform, and corresponding controls, for administering
our leases and facilitating compliance with the new guidance.
As part of our adoption, we will not reassess historical lease classification, will not recognize short-term leases on our balance
sheet, will utilize the portfolio approach to group leases with similar charact eristics and will not separate lease and non-lease
components for our real estate leases. We will adopt the guidance prospectivel y when it becomes effective in the first quarter of
2019. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements, with an expected increase of
approximately 2% to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet, subject to completion of our assessment. See
Note 15 for our minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases.

Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 29, 2018  and
using average 2018  foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:

Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written
down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future

cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the
need for revision. For additional unaudited information on our policies for amortizable brands, see “Our Critical Accounting
Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 29, 2018 , December 30,
2017  and December 31, 2016 . We recognized no material impairmen t charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in each of the
fiscal years ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017  and December 31, 2016 . As of December 29, 2018 , the estimated fair
values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at NAB exceeded their carrying values. However ,
there could be an impairment of the carrying value of NAB’ s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their
contribution to the operating results of NAB’ s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic
conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the
impact of the macroeconomic condition s in Russia and Brazil on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in
these countries and have concluded that there were no material impairments for the year ended December 29, 2018 . However , there
could be an impairm ent of the carrying value of certain brands in these countr ies if there is a deterioration in these conditions, if
future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows, if there are significant
changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, or if macroeconomic conditions
result in a future increase in the weigh ted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. For additional information on our
policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States . Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed
a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from
35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of
$2.5 billion  ($1.70  per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017. See further unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability”
in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion  recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017, was a provisional mandatory
one-time transition tax of approximate ly $4 billion  on undis tributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This
provisional mandatory one-time transition tax was partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion  benefit resulting from the required
remeasurement of our deferred tax asset s and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018.
The effect of the remeasurement was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act, and
reflected in our provision for income taxes.
98
Table of Contents
During 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $28 million  ($0.02  per share) primarily reflecting the impact of the final analysis of
certain foreign exchange gains or losses , substantiation of foreign tax credits, as well as cash and cash equivalents as of November
30, 2018, the tax year-end of our foreig n subsidiaries, partially offset by additional transition tax guidance issued by the United
States Department of Treasury , as well as the TCJ Act impact of both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and the
resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, each discussed below .
As of December 29, 2018, our mandator y transition tax liability is $3.8 billion . Under the provisio ns of the TCJ Act, this transition
tax liabilit y must be paid over eight years; we currently expect to pay approximately $0.4 billion  of this liability in 2019 and the
remainder over the period 2020 to 2026.
The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as GILTI, must be included in
the gross income of their U.S. shareholder . The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for
temporary differenc es expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recogni zing such taxes as a current-period expense when
incurred. During the first quarter of 2018, we elected to treat the tax ef fect of GIL TI as a current-period expense when incurred.
In 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recordi ng of provisional tax expense using a measurement
period, not to excee d one year, when information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ Act is not
available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act
when it became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017. The provisional measu rement period ended in the fourth quarter of 2018.
While our accountin g for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing
regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned
amounts in future periods.

Capital Resources” and “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations. 
International Reorganizations
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we reorganized certain of our international operations, including the intercompany transfer of
certain intangible assets. As a result, we recognized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion  ($3.05  per share). The related deferred tax
asset of $4.4 billion  is expected to be amortized over a period of 15 years beginning in 2019. Additionally , the reorganization
generated significan t net operating loss carryforwards and related deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized, resulting
in the recording of a full valuation allowance.

Reserves
A number  of years may elapse before a particular matter , for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved.
The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related

Table of Contents
During 2018, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $364 million  ($0.26  per share) resulting from the conclusion of certain
international tax audits. Additionally , during 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $353 million  ($0.24  per share) as a
result of our agreem ent with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, including the
associated state impact.
While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter , we believe that our
reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light
of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution
would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution. For further unaudited information on the impact
of the resolution of open tax issues, see “Other Consolidated Results” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
As of December 29, 2018 , the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $1.4 billion . We
accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income  taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $179 million  as
of December 29, 2018 , which reflects a reduction of the prior  year liability of $64 million  of tax benefit that was recognized in
2018 . The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $283 million  as of December 30, 2017 , of which $89
million  of expense was recognized in 2017 .
A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Carryforwards and Allowances
Operating loss carryforwards totaling $24.9 billion  at year-end 2018  are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state
jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating
losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion  in 2019 , $20.5 billion  between 2020  and 2038 and $4.2 billion  may be carried forward
indefinitely . We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Undistributed International Earnings
In connect ion with the enactment of the TCJ Act, during 2018, we repatriated $20.4 billion  of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments held in our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. federal income tax liability . As of
December 29, 2018 , we had approximately $24 billion  of undistr ibuted international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest
$24 billion  of earning s outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while U.S. federal tax expense has been recognized
as a result of the TCJ Act, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or
101
Table of Contents
losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of
unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.
Note 6 — Shar e-Based Compensation
Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with
the interes ts of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs),
PepsiCo equity performance units (PEPunits) and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder -approved PepsiCo,
Inc. Long -Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may
generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock
options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other
senior executives do not have a choice and were granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-
established performance tar gets.
The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and
the vesting of RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits.
As of December 29, 2018 , 66 million  shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the L TIP.
The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense and excess tax benefits recognized:
 2018  2017  2016
Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 256  $ 292  $ 284
Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 20  13  5

Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 45  $ 89(a) $ 91
Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation (b)$ 48  $ 115  $ 110
(a) Reflects tax rates ef fective for the 2017 tax year .
(b) Included in provision for income taxes in the income statement in 2018 and 2017; included in capital in excess of par value in the equity statement in 2016.
As of December 29, 2018 , there was $282 million  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two
years.
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions
The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three  years. Awards to
employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the
date that the employ ee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we
use histori cal data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected
to vest.
We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively . Repricing of awards would require
shareholder approval under the L TIP.
102
Table of Contents
Stock Options
A stock option perm its the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock  at a specified price. We account for our employee
stock options under the fair value metho d of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at
the date of grant. All stock option grant s have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of
grant and generally have a 10-year term.
Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:
2018  2017  2016
Expected life 5 years  5 years  6 years
Risk-free interest rate 2.6% 2.0% 1.4%
Expected volatility 12% 11% 12%
Expected dividend yield 2.7% 2.7% 2.7%
The expec ted life is the period over which our employee groups are expected  to hold their options. It is based on our historical
experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life.
Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historica l period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend
yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and
stock price.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units
Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiC o common stock when the award vests at the end
of the service period . PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of
the service period based on PepsiCo’ s performance against specified financial and/or operational performance metrics. The number
of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance
metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue
dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.
The fair value of RSUs is measured at the market price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant. The fair
103
Table of Contents
value of PSUs is measured at the market price of the Company’ s stock on the date of grant with the exception of awards with
market conditions, for which we use the Monte-Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value. The Monte-Carlo simulation
model uses the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model; however , it also further incorporates into the fair-value
determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Compensation costs related to these awards are
recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided.

PEPunits
PEPunits provide an opportunity to earn shares of PepsiCo common stock with a value that adjusts based upon changes in
PepsiCo’ s absolute stock price as well as PepsiCo’ s Total Shareholder Return relative to the S&P 500 over a three -year
performance period.
The fair value of PEPunits is measured using the Monte-Carlo simulation model.
PEPunits were last granted in 2015 and all 248,000  units outstanding at December 30, 2017, with a weighted average grant date fair
value of $68.94 , were converted to 278,000  shares during fiscal year 2018.
Long-T erm Cash
Certain executive officers and other senior executives were granted long-term  cash awards for which final payout is based on
PepsiCo’ s Total Shareholder Return relative to a specific set of peer companies  and achievement of a specified performance target
over a three-year performance period.
Long-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards under share-based compensation guidance are valued through the end of the
performance period on a mark-to-market basis using the Monte Carlo simulation model until actual performance is determined.

Note 7 — Pension, Retir ee Medical and Savings Plans
Effective January 1, 2017, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans were  reorganized into Plan A and Plan I. Actuarial gains
and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining  service life of the active participants, while the
actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a
result of this change, the pre-tax net periodic
105
Table of Contents
benefit cost decreased by $42 million  ($27 million  after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share)
in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’ s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In 2016, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance
company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments  for certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary
contributions of $452 million  primarily to fund the transfer of the obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge
of $242 million  ($162 million  after-tax or $0.11 per share). See additional unaudite d information in “Items Affecting
Comparability” in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual
return on plan assets and the expected  return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each
measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If
this net accumulated  gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-rela ted value of plan assets or plan liabilities, a portion
of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) for the following year based upon
the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 10 years) and retiree medical (approximately 7 years),
or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 25 years). The cost or benefit of plan changes that
increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical
benefits income/(ex pense) on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A or the
remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I.

Table of Contents
The amou nt we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned
by employees for working during the year .
The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:
•Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
•Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will
be used to settle future benefit obligations.
•Amortization of prior service cost/(cred it) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting
from plan amendments.
•Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets
and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
•Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related
projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due
to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are
irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for project ed benefit obligations. Curtailments are due
to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment
losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailme nt gains are recognized when an event has
occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).
•Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as
restructuring.

Future Benefit Payments
Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 - 2028
Pension $ 1,060 $ 960 $ 875 $ 915 $ 950 $ 5,265
Retiree medical (a)$ 115 $ 105 $ 100 $ 100 $ 95 $ 395
(a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expe cted to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are
expected to be approximately $ 2 million  for each of the years from 2019  through 2023  and approximately $6 million  in total for 2024 through 2028.
These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.

(a) Includes $1.4 billion  contribution in 2018 to fund Plan A in the United States. Includes $ 452 million  in 2016 relati ng to the funding of the group annuity contract purchase
from an unrelated insurance company .
109
Table of Contents
In January 2019, we made discretionary contributions of $150 million  to Plan A in the United States. In addition, in 2019, we
expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $205 million  to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans
and approximately $40 million  for retire e medica l benefits. We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility
associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.
Plan Assets
Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction
with plan liabilities , an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This
strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are
available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Asse ts contributed to our pension plans are no longer
controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. Howe ver, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these
plan assets  as compared to changes in our projected liabilities. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a
well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our
investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and
foreign currency risks. Futures contract s represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified
price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.
For 2019  and 2018 , our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.1%  and 7.2% , respectively . Our target investment
allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:
 2019 2018
Fixed income 47% 47%
U.S. equity 29% 29%
International equity 20% 20%
Real estate 4% 4%
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly
review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.
The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset
class, takin g into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels
of interest  rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions
annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for
fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes
investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over
a five-year period. This has the ef fect of reducing year -to-year volatility .

Savings Plan
Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The plan
is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement, and we make Company matching contributions for certain
employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.
Certain U.S. salaried  employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined  benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an
employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.
In 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , our total Company contributions were $180 million , $176 million  and $164 million , respectively .

In 2018, we entered into a new five-ye ar unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Y ear Credit Agreement) which expires on
June 4, 2023. The Five-Y ear Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion , subject to
customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion .
Additionally , we may , once a year , request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period.
Also in 2018, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on
June 3, 2019. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion , subject to
customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion . We may
request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of
up to one year, which would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The Five-Y ear Credit
Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced our $3.75 billion  five-year credit agreement and our $3.75
billion  364-day credit agreement, both dated as of June 5, 2017. Funds borrowed under the Five-Y ear Credit Agreement and the
364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow , prepay and
reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 29, 2018 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Y ear
Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.
In 2016, we paid $2.5 billion  to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900%  senior notes due 2018 and 5.125%  senior notes due 2019 for
the principal amounts of $1.5 billion  and $750 million , respectively , and terminated certain interest rate swaps. As a result, we
recorded a pre-tax charge of $233 million  ($156 million  after-tax or $0.11 per share) to interest expense, primarily representing the
premium paid in accordance with the

Note 9 — Financial Instruments
Derivatives and Hedging
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, af fecting the cost of our raw materials and ener gy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
In the normal cours e of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of
strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the
identification and effective implementat ion of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives.
Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.
Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain
derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not
qualify and are marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from deriv atives used to manage commodity price, foreign
exchange or interest rate risks are class ified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and
cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. See “Our Business Risks” in Management’ s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our business risks.
We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk
regularly , including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential
nonperformance of the counterparty . Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to
be low. In addition,  we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in
order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.
Commodity Prices
We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased  costs through higher pricing may be limited in the
competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders,
pricing agreements and derivative instru ments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain
raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more
than three  years, to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily
for energy, agricultural products and metals . Ineffectiv eness for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment was
not materi al for all periods presented. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either
cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity . These gains and losses are
114
Table of Contents
subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion  as of December 29, 2018  and $0.9 billion  as of December 30,
2017 .
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our net revenue in 2018 , with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United
Kingdom and Brazil  comprising approximately 20% of our net revenue in 2018 . As a result, we are exposed to foreign  exchange
risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold.
Additionally , we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and
foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases
from local  suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily
forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are
recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset
the ef fects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
Our foreig n currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.0 billion  as of December 29, 2018  and $1.6 billion  as of
December 30, 2017 . The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investmen t hedges was $0.9 billion  as of
December 29, 2018  and $1.5 billion  as of December 30, 2017 . Ineffectiveness for derivatives and non-derivatives that qualify for
hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment, all gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net
impact on earnings.
Inter est Rates
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investm ent opportunities and risks, tax consequences and
overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instrument s including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps,
cross-currency interest rate swaps, T reasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.
These instruments ef fectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness
have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-
currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturit y date of the related debt. Our Treasury locks and
swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.
Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $10.5 billion  as of December 29, 2018  and $14.2 billion  as of
December 30, 2017 . Ineffectiveness for derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment was not material for all
periods presented.
As of December 29, 2018 , approximately 29% of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was
subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 43% as of December 30, 2017 .
Available-for-Sale Securities
Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for -sale. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Our investments in available-for -sale
115
Table of Contents
debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of available-for -sale debt
securities are recognized in accumulate d other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity . Unrealized gains and
losses on our investments in debt securities as of December 29, 2018  and December 30, 2017  were not material. Changes in the fair
value of available-for -sale debt securities impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other -than-temporary
impairment is recognized. We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any debt security is other -than-temporarily
impaired. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a debt
security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any change s thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will
more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a
debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions
related to any particular debt security . We recorded no other -than-temporary impairment charges on our available-for -sale debt
securities for the years ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017  and December 31, 2016 .
In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $95 million  ($85 million  after-tax or $0.06  per share), net of discount and fees, associated
with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic. The gain on the sale of this equity  investment was recorded in our ESSA segment in
selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 2 for additional information on investments in certain equity securities.
KSF Beverage Holding Co., Ltd.
During 2016, we concluded that the decline in estimated fair value of our 5% indirect equity interest in KSFB was other than
temporary based on significant negative economic trends in China and changes in assumptions associated with KSFB’ s future
financial performance arising from the disclosure by KSFB’ s parent company , Tingyi, regarding the operating results of its
beverage business. As a result, we recor ded a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million  ($0.26  per share) in 2016 in the
AMENA segment. This charge was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses on our income statement and reduced
the value of our 5% indir ect equity interest in KSFB to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value was derived using both an
income and market approach, and is considered a non-recurring Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy . The carrying
value of the investm ent in KSFB was $166 million  as of December 29, 2018  and December 30, 2017 . We continue to monitor the
impact of economic and other developments on the remaining value of our investment in KSFB.

Note 14 — Acquisitions and Divestitur es
Acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd.
On December 5, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of SodaStream , a manufacturer and distributor of sparkling water
makers, for $144.00  per share in cash, in a transaction value d at approximately $3.3 billion . The total considera tion transferred was
approximately $3.3 billion  (or $3.2 billion , net of cash and cash equivalents acqui red), including $2.0 billion  of consideration held
by our paying agent in connection with this acquisition and reported as restricted cash as of December 29, 2018.
We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in SodaStream as of the acquisition date include goodwill and other intangible
assets of $3.0 billion  and property, plant and equipment of $0.2 billion , all of which are recorded in our ESSA segment. The
preliminary estimates of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to revisions, which may
result in adjustments to the preliminary values discussed above as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as
soon as possible, but no later than the end of 2019.
Under the guidance on accounting for business combinations, merger and integration costs are not included as components of
consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred. In 2018, we incurred 
merger and integration charges of $75 million  ($0.05  per share), including $57 million  in our ESSA segment and $18 million  in
corporate unallocated expenses. These charges include closing costs, advisory fees and employee-related costs  and were recorded
in selling, general and administrative expenses. See “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and “Items Affecting Comparability” in
Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Refranchising in Thailand
In 2018, we refranch ised our beverage business in Thailand by selling a controlling interest in our Thailand bottling operations to
form a joint venture , where we now have an equity method investment. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $144 million  ($126 million
after-tax or $0.09  per share) in selling, general and administrative expenses in our AMENA segment as a result of this transaction.
Refranchising in Czech Republic, Hungary , and Slovakia
In 2018, we refranc hised our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS (included within our
ESSA segment). We recorded a pre-tax gain of $58 million  ($46 million  after-tax or $0.03  per share) in selling, general and
administrative expenses in our ESSA segment as a result of this transaction.

To Our Shareholders:
At PepsiC o, our actions – the actions of all our associates – are governed by our Global Code of Conduct. This Code is clearly

The mana gement of PepsiCo is respons ible for the objectivity and integrity of our consolidated financial statements. The Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors has engaged independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, to audit our
consolidated financial statements, and they have expressed an unqualified opinion.
We are committed to providing timely , accurate and understandable informatio n to investors. Our commitment encompasses the
following:
Maintaining strong contr ols over financial reporting.  Our syste m of internal control is based  on the control criteria framework
of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission  published in their report titled Internal Contr ol –
Integrated Framework (2013). The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transaction s are executed as authorized
and accura tely recorded; that assets are safeguarded; and that accounting record s are sufficiently reliable to permit the preparation
of financial statements that conform in all material respects with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods. We monitor
these internal controls through self-assessments and an ongoing program of internal audits. Our internal controls are reinforced
through our Global Code of Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity , and within both the letter

Exerting rigor ous oversight of the business.  We continuously review our business results and strategies. This encompasses
financial discipline in our strategic and daily business decisions. Our Executive Committee is actively involved – from
understanding strategies and alternatives to reviewing key initiatives and financial performance. The intent is to ensure we remain
objective in our assessments, constructively challenge our approach to potential business opportunities and issues, and monitor
results and controls.
Engaging strong and effective Corporate Governance from our Board of Directors.  We have an active,  capable and diligen t
Board that meets the required standard s for independence, and we welcome the Board’ s oversight as a representative of our
shareholders. Our Audit Committee is comprised of independent directors with the financial literacy , knowledge and experience to

practices.
Providing investors with financial results that are complete, transpar ent and understandable.  The consolidated financial

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
PepsiCo, Inc.:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash
Flows, and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2018 and the related notes (collectively ,
the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 29, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrat ed Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 29, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Or ganizations of the T readway Commission.
As permitted by SEC guidance, the scope of management’ s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as of December 29, 2018 excluded SodaStream International Ltd. and its subsidiaries (“SodaStream”), which the
Company acquired in December 2018 . SodaStream’ s total assets and net revenue represented approximately 5% and 1%,
respectively , of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of PepsiCo, Inc. as of and for the year ended December 29, 2018.  Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting of PepsiCo, Inc. also excluded  an evaluation of the internal control over financial
reporting of SodaStream.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’ s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’ s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company’ s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audits. We are a public accounti ng firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We condu cted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audits  of the consolidated financial  statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over
128
Table of Contents
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we consider ed necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Contr ol over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over finan cial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and direc tors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that
could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ARTICLE I - HIST ORY AND GENERAL INFORMA TION
The Plan came into operation on and took ef fect from September 1, 1980, and was comprised of the “PepsiCo International
Retirement Plan T rust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules”, and was later amended and restated in its entirety , effective September 2,
1982.
The Plan was further amended and restated in its entirety , effective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became the
“Plan A Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation’ s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo
International Retirement Plan T rust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they
arise) took ef fect.
The Plan was further amended ef fective January 1, 2005, so that no person subject to taxation in the United States of
America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but
instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated Company permanently before becoming subject
to U.S. taxation.
 
Effective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form a single
governing legal document, as set forth herein. The terms of the Plan set forth in this amended and restated governing legal
document are known as the “DB Program” (also known as “PIRP-DB”). This amended and restated governing legal document shall
apply to Members who are in Membership from and after January 1, 2010, as well as any others who claim rights from and after
January 1, 2010 that are derived from current or former Membership, including former Members and the Dependants and Eligible
Spouses of Members and former Members. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the amendment and restatement of
this Plan, the supersession of the prior documents by this Plan, and the prior existence of separate Plan A and Plan B Rules shall
not at any time result in any duplication of benefits (nor shall duplication of benefits result from any other factor or circumstance
related to this Plan or any prior version of this Plan).
Effective January 1, 201 1, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit
selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate (i.e., employees on assignments outside of their
home countries for whom it is judged to be impracticable to have them participate in their home country retirement plans and
employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the DC
Program are set forth in a separate governing legal document. Together , the DC Program and the DB Program set forth the terms of
a single Plan.
The DB Program was previously amended and restated, ef fective January 1, 2016. The DB Program is hereby amended and
restated ef fective January 1, 2019 (the “Restatement Date”).
At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
1
(“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that executive’ s individual employer . With respect to his employer , the
executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor . The Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained
outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United
States.

determines to give credit under the DB Program to the Member . Absent special circumstances, as determined by the V ice

sentence.

any special allowances (whether given in respect of residence, cost of living, education, transfer or otherwise).
If a Member has Salary in accordance with the prior sentence and then ceases to be employed by an Employer (but the
Member remains employed by a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization), compensation while employed by the member of
the PepsiCo Or ganization that otherwise would qualify as Salary hereunder shall be considered Salary for purposes of the
DB Program. In the event a Member ’s Salary is either (i) paid in currency other than United States dollars or (ii) paid in
United States dollars but not tied to the United States salary ranges established by the Corporation, as updated from time to
time, such currency shall be converted to United States dollars according to procedures established by the Global Mobility
Team, or if no so such procedures exist as of the time in question, as reasonably determined by the V ice President.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this definition, the V ice President may exercise his discretion to determine a
Member's Salary based on an alternative definition that is dif ferent than that set forth above.
(y) "Service " means in relation to a Third Country National  (or other employee deemed an Eligible Employee by the
Vice President) only the period during which such Third Country National (or such other employee) was continuously in
employment (including all permissible periods of authorized leave of absence) with any Approved Employer . A permissible
period of authorized leave of absence is a period of absence of not more than 12 months, unless a longer period is
individually authorized in writing by the V ice President. A break in service of less than 12 months shall not be considered to
have broken the continuity of a Member's Service. Other breaks in service (including a break in service of at least 12
months and a break in service before an individual has become a Member) shall break the continuity of an individual’ s
Service, and employment before the break in service will only be counted as Service if it would otherwise qualify under this
subsection and the V ice President approves its being counted (which approval may provide for such pre-break employment
being counted as vesting Service, entitlement Service, or both). Vesting Service means Service that is taken into account
solely in determining vesting, and entitlement Service means Service that is taken into account solely in determining
entitlement for Early Retirement, Normal Retirement and Late Retirement.
For an individual who transfers from employment with an Employer as an ineligible Employee to the status of an
Eligible Employee of an Employer , his pre-transfer period of employment with an Employer may be counted as Service
only with
7
the approval of the V ice President (which approval may provide for such pre-transfer employment being counted as vesting
Service, entitlement Service, or both).
Except as otherwise provided by the V ice President, Service shall not include an individual’ s periods of employment
with any company or undertaking prior to it becoming an Employer or a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization.
No determination of an individual’ s Service shall result in any duplication, and all of the DB Program’ s provisions
shall at all times be interpreted consistently with the terms of this subsection.
(z) “Status Change ” means any change in a Member ’s circumstances (other than a change in circumstances that
constitutes an Approved T ransfer) that will cause the Member to become a U.S. Person.
(aa) "Third Country National " means any individual who is not: (1) a U.S. Person, (2) employed in his home
country , (3) employed in his hire country , except as permitted by the V ice President, nor (4) accruing benefits under a
retirement plan sponsored by his Employer in his home country while abroad. An individual’ s home or hire country as of
any time shall be the country that is designated at that time as the individual’ s home or hire country , respectively , on the
records of the applicable entity (which shall be the Global Mobility T eam, its successor (if any) or such other group within
the PepsiCo Or ganization that is designated for this purpose by the V ice President), or is so designated in accordance with
such rules as the applicable entity shall choose to apply from time to time. The records described in the preceding sentence
are intended to be maintained outside the United States of America.
(bb) " U.S. Person " means: (1) a citizen of the United States of America; (2) a person lawfully admitted for
permanent residence in the United States of America at any time during the calendar year , or who has applied for such
permanent residence (within the meaning of United States Internal Revenue Code section 7701(b)(1)(A)); or (3) any other
person who is a resident alien of the United States of America under United States Internal Revenue Code section 7701(b)
(1)(A) because, for example, the person satisfies the substantial presence test under United States Internal Revenue Code
section 7701(b)(3) or makes an election to be treated as a United States resident under United States Internal Revenue Code
section 7701(b)(4). In addition, a person shall be considered a U.S. Person for purposes of Section 9.14 in any year for
which the person is required by the United States Internal Revenue Code to file an individual income tax return, unless the
Vice President determines that it is clear that the person has no U.S. source earned income from a member of the PepsiCo
Organization for such year .
(cc) "Vice President " means the V ice President, Global Benefits & W ellness of PepsiCo, Inc. but if such position is
vacant or eliminated it shall be the person who is acting to fulfill the majority of the duties of the position (or plurality of the
duties, if no

words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender and words importing the singular number shall

(b) Determining Periods of Y ears:  For the purposes of the DB Program, any period of 365 consecutive days (or of
366 consecutive days, if the period includes 29th February) shall be deemed to constitute a year , but not so that in the
calculation of a number of years any day is counted more than once. Where the amount of a benefit depends upon the
calculation of a number of years or months without expressly requiring that these should be complete years or months, a
proportionate amount ( i.e., a number of days) may be given for any part of a year or month which would not otherwise be
included in the calculation.  Where the this document makes reference to months or parts of a year , or to any other period of
time except a day , week or year the V ice President may authorize the period to be counted in days or complete calendar
months with each calendar month counted as 1/12th of a year .
(c) Compounds of the W ord “Here”:  The words “hereof” and “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the word
“here” shall mean and refer to the entire DB Program, not to any particular provision or section.     
(d) Examples:  Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or
items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passages of the document shall be construed as if the phrase
“without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limitation
on its breadth of application).
(e) Subdivisions of This Document:  This document is divided and subdivided using the following progression:
articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals.
Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower -case letters in
parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower -case
roman numerals in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper -case letters in parentheses. Any reference in a section to a
subsection (with no accompanying section reference) shall be read as a reference to the subsection with the specified
designation contained in that same section. A similar rule shall apply with respect to paragraph references within a
subsection and subparagraph references within a paragraph.

ARTICLE IV - REQUIREMENTS FOR BENEFITS
4.01    Normal Retir ement Pension.
A Member shall be entitled to a Normal Retirement Pension if his employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo

coincident with or immediately following the day the Member terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo
Organization. The Member ’s Pension shall be paid in the normal form of payment applicable to the Member under Section 5.02
unless the Member elects an optional form of payment under Section 5.03. The Member ’s Pension shall be calculated in
accordance with T able A.
4.02    Early Retir ement Pension.
A Member shall be entitled to an Early Retirement Pension if his employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo
Organization terminates on or after age 55 but before his Normal Retirement Age, and after he has completed 10 or more years of
Service. The Member ’s Annuity Starting Date ordinarily shall be his Normal Retirement Date. The Member may , however , by
filing a written election with the V ice President, direct that his Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of any month after the
Member terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization but before the Member's Normal
Retirement Date. The amount of such Pension shall be computed in accordance with T able A as if the Member retired at his
Normal Retirement Date, but on the basis of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary (as defined in T able A) and
Pensionable Service as of his employment termination date; provided, however , that, in the case of a Member electing to receive his
Pension prior to attaining his Normal Retirement Date, the amount of his Pension shall be reduced by 4/12 of 1 percent for each
month by which the day on which the Pension commences precedes the date on which the Member would have attained age 62.
4.03    Special Early Retir ement Pension.
A Member may be entitled to receive a Special Early Retirement Pension if his employment with both his Employer and
the PepsiCo Or ganization terminates on or after age 50 but before age 55 and after completion of not less than 10 years of Service
and only if such Special Early Retirement Pension payments have been authorized by the V ice President. The Annuity Starting
Date of such Special Early Retirement Pension shall be the first day of the month after the V ice President authorizes such Special
Early Retirement Pension. The amount of such Pension shall be computed in accordance with T able A, as if the Member retired at

Pensionable Service as of his employment termination date; provided, however , that the amount of such Member's Pension so
determined shall be reduced by 4/12 of 1 percent for each month by which the day on which the Pension commences precedes the
date on which the Member would have attained age 62.
11
4.04    Deferr ed V ested Pension.
(a) This Section 4.04 applies to a Member who terminates employment with both his Employer and the PepsiCo
Organization before becoming eligible for a Normal Retirement Pension, Early Retirement Pension or Special Early

(b) A Member described in (a) above who has met one of the requirement to be vested in Sections 4.06 and 4.07
shall be entitled to receive a Pension (hereinafter referred to as a “Deferred V ested Pension”). The amount of such Deferred
Vested Pension shall be determined in accordance with T able A; provided, however , that in the case of a Member who
remains in the employment of the PepsiCo Or ganization or any Employer after ceasing to be an Active Member , the amount
of such Member ’s Deferred V ested Pension shall be determined in accordance with T able A by reference to (i) the
Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary at the date the Member terminates employment with both his Employer and the
PepsiCo Or ganization (but only to the extent permitted under Sections 9.13 and 9.14), and (ii) the Member ’s Pensionable

with both his Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization, if later). In the case of a Member electing to receive his Deferred
Vested Pension prior to attaining his Normal Retirement Date, the amount of his Pension shall be reduced in accordance
with the reduction factors applicable to early commencement of a “V ested Pension” under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan, not
the percentage factors which apply to an Early and Special Early Retirement Pension as described in Sections 4.02 and 4.03.
(d) If Member becomes entitled to a Deferred V ested Pension under subsection (a) above and once again becomes an
Eligible Employee, he shall be re-admitted to Active Membership in accordance with the provisions of Article III. His
Service and Pensionable Service from his earlier period as an Active Member shall be aggregated with his subsequent
period of Service and Pensionable Service for purposes of calculating his Pension upon his later retirement or other

A Member who continues employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization or any Employer after his Normal Retirement Age

Subject to Section 9.14 and to T able A (I)(c), a Member shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, his
Pension upon completing 5 years of Service, or if earlier , upon the death or disability of the Member while employed by the
Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization. The determination of whether a Member has become disabled for this purpose shall be made
by the V ice President in accordance with such standards that the V ice President deems to be appropriate as of the time in question.
4.07    Special V esting for Appr oved T ransfers and Status Changes.
(a) Automatic Special V esting for Approved T ransfers.  Notwithstanding Section 4.06 above, in the case of an Active

vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of – (a) the Active Member ’s Approved T ransfer , or (b) the day
the Active Member would become a U.S. Person in connection with the Approved T ransfer .
(b) Special V esting for Status Changes . Also notwithstanding Section 4.06 above, in the case of an Active Member
who will have a Status Change, the Active Member may request that the V ice President apply special vesting to him as of
the last business day before the Active Member ’s Status Change. In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to
be valid and ef fective under the DB Program, the Active Member ’s request and the V ice President’ s approval of the request
must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies.
Subject to the next sentence, the ef fect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b)
above is that the Member will become vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 4.06 if the Member vested under that
Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 4.07, rights under
this Section 4.07 are subject to the overriding requirement that benefits and other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt
from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this Section 4.07 shall not apply to the extent inconsistent with
this requirement.

13
that have been suspended, and any additional benefits accrued by Member after his prior benefit commencement, shall be paid at
his subsequent Annuity Starting Date. The suspension or continuation of a Member ’s prior benefits, any adjustments to the
Member ’s benefits that are payable upon his subsequent Annuity Starting Date, and the election of a time and form of payment for
benefits payable at the subsequent Annuity Starting Date, shall be subject to rules established by the V ice President for this
purpose. Such rules shall be based upon the PepsiCo Salaried Plan’ s rules for benefits accrued after the benefit commencement date
of a participant in that plan, unless the V ice President determines that a modification of those rules is appropriate.

Member ’s Dependant or estate (as applicable) may elect by following the procedures set forth by the V ice President

payment, and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in Sections 5.02 and 5.03. The
benefit shall be divided between the two forms of payment based on the whole number percentages designated by the
Member on a form provided for this purpose. To be ef fective, the two percentages designated by the Member must add to
100 percent.
(1) The amount of the benefit paid in the form of a lump sum is determined by multiplying: (A) the amount
determined under Section 5.03(c) by (B) the percentage that the Member has designated for receipt in the form of a
lump sum.
(2) The amount of the benefit paid in the form of a monthly benefit is determined by multiplying: (A) the
amount of the monthly benefit elected by the Member , determined in accordance with Sections 5.03(a) or (b), by (B)
the percentage that the Member has designated for receipt in the form of a monthly benefit.
(e) Death Prior to Pension Becoming Payable : If a Member who is entitled to an immediate Pension under Article
IV elects an optional form of payment under this Section 5.03, if such election meets all requirements to be ef fective (other
than the Member ’s survival, but including the time for making the election and any necessary Eligible Spouse’ s consent),
and thereafter the Member dies after leaving employment but before such Pension becomes payable, then on the first day of
the month next following his death such optional form of payment shall be deemed to be in ef fect. Such deemed
effectiveness may only apply once and only to the initial election made by a Member (except as permitted by a decision of
the V ice President that is made prior to the Member ’s submission of a subsequent purported election). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of the option under Section 5.03(b), if the Member ’s specified Dependant has died or shall die before
the date on which the first installment of the Member ’s Pension was prospectively payable in accordance with the optional
form of payment elected by the Member , the Member ’s election of such optional form shall not be given ef fect.

such survivor option is more than 10 years younger than the Member .
18
(1) Not More than 20 Y ears Y ounger : In the event the Dependant is more than 10 years younger than the
Member , but not more than 20 years younger , the percentage reduction that otherwise would apply shall be
increased by 5 percentage points.
(2) More than 20 Y ears Y ounger : In the event the Dependant is more than 20 years younger than the
Member , the 5 percentage point increase in the reduction provided in (1) above shall be further increased by an
additional 0.2 percent for each full year over 20.
5.04    Applicability of Certain Options.
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article V , the availability of certain distribution options shall be restricted
in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.04.
(a) Pre-1990 Distributions : The form of payment described in Section 5.03(d) above shall not be available unless the

(b) Deferred V ested Pensions : Deferred V ested Pensions under Section 4.04 shall be eligible for payment only under
the Single Life Annuity , the 50 Percent Survivor Option or the 75 Percent Survivor Option, except as provided in the next
sentence. Effective as of January 1, 2015, Deferred V ested Pensions under Section 4.04 shall also be eligible for the Lump
Sum Payment option, but only to the limited extent that such option is available on an on-going basis with respect to
deferred vested pensions under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan (except that unlike participants in the PepsiCo Salaried Plan,
participants in this Plan with a benefit under the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan shall not be excluded from the Lump
Sum Payment option).
(c) Simplified Actuarial Factors : In the case of a Member who became entitled to a Pension prior to January 1, 1990,
the actuarial equivalencies described in the preceding provisions of this Article V shall be adjusted as provided by the V ice
President from time to time to reflect the value of any subsidized survivor benefit to which the Member is entitled under the
last sentence of Section 5.02(b) (regarding the availability on favorable terms of the survivor benefit described in Section
5.02(b)).
5.05    Cashout of Certain Benefits.
(a) Cashout of Small Benefits . Where the total Pension payable to any person under the DB Program is, in
the opinion of the V ice President, of an amount that is relatively trivial (when considered by itself or in relation to the
potential administrative burden of continuing to keep track of such Pension under the DB Program), he may commute the
whole of such Pension to a lump sum payable following (i) the relevant Member ’s termination of employment from both his
Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization, or (ii) a Member ’s transfer within the PepsiCo Or ganization that results in
19
the Member ceasing to actively accrue all benefits under the DB Program, on a date determined in the discretion of the V ice
President, without the consent of the Member .
(b) Discretionary Cashout After Benefit Commencement . Effective January 1, 2019, the V ice President shall have
the discretion to make a lump-sum payment to any Member whose benefit payments have commenced (in a form other than
a lump-sum), if the present value of the Member ’s remaining stream of payments is less than or equal to $75,000 on the
payment date. The amount of the lump sum payment shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Member ’s remaining stream of
payments, determined utilizing the lump sum equivalent factors specified in Section 5.03(c) calculated as of the a payment
date determined in the discretion of the V ice President.
5.06    Designation of Dependant.
A Member who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall
designate a Dependant who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member shall have the right to change or
revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the ef fective date of his election. If the Member is married at the time he
designates a Dependant, any designation under this section of a Dependant who is not the Member ’s Eligible Spouse shall require
the written consent of the Member ’s Eligible Spouse. A revocation of a Dependant does not require consent by the Member ’s
Eligible Spouse. The designation of any Dependant, and any change or revocation thereof, and any written consent of a Member ’s
Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the V ice President, shall be made in
writing on forms provided by the V ice President, and shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the V ice President. In the case
of the survivor option described in Section 5.03(b)(4), the following shall apply: (i) the Member shall be entitled to name both a
primary Dependant and a contingent Dependant, and (ii) if no Dependant is properly designated, then a Member ’s election of such
option will not be given ef fect.
20

Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension payable to the Member ’s surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner (as

In the event of the death of a Member who is not described in Section 6.01 above, who is vested under Section 4.06 or
Section 4.07 and who has not yet commenced or received the Member ’s Pension, if such Member is survived by an Eligible Spouse
or an Eligible Domestic Partner and is not entitled at the time of death to the protections provided by Section 5.03(e), there shall be
payable a Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension (as applicable), which shall be
calculated based on the Member ’s Salary and Pensionable Service as of the earlier of the Member ’s death or termination of
employment. The benefit shall be calculated as if the Member lived until the earliest date the Member ’s vested benefit could have
started, after having elected to start his benefit at that time in the form of a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity , and died that same day .
Coverage for this Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension shall be paid for with a
reduction to the monthly benefit otherwise payable to the Member . The reduction char ged to the Member ’s benefit shall be
calculated in accordance with the methodology , and based on the same factors, provided for under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan, as in
effect from time to time. The Member may only waive this Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension coverage or Pre-Retirement Domestic
Partner ’s Coverage (as applicable) with the approval of the V ice President.

Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner may elect to receive the Pension in the form of a single lump sum payment in

Partner under this Article VI shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the Member ’s
death, or if later , the date on which the Member would have attained age 55. In the event a Pension payable to a Member ’s
Eligible Spouse commences before the Member would have reached Normal Retirement Age, the benefit will be reduced as
set forth in Section 4.02, 4.03 or 4.04, as applicable based on the Pension to which the Member was entitled, to reflect early
commencement.
6.04    Disposition of Death Benefits.
Any benefit expressed to be subject to disposition in accordance with the provision of this Article VI shall be held by the
Vice President with power to pay or apply the same to or for the benefit of such one or more of the Member ’s Dependants, as the

7.01    Authority to Administer Plan.
(a) Administration by the V ice President:  The Plan shall be administered by the V ice President, who shall have the
authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the V ice President
hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations, determinations and regulations made or issued by the
Vice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned.
(b) Authority to Delegate:  The V ice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other
persons or entities, or designate or employ other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions
under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the V ice President shall, to the extent applicable, refer to such
action by the V ice President’ s delegate or other designated person.
7.02    Facility of Payment.
Whenever , in the opinion of the V ice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment thereof
hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the V ice
President may direct that payments from the Plan be made to such person’ s legal representative for his benefit, or that the payment
be applied for the benefit of such person in such manner as the V ice President considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or
installment thereof in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for the making of
such payment under the provisions of the Plan.
7.03    Claims Pr ocedur e.
The V ice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all
questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits, and his decisions on such matters are final and
conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the V ice President decides in his discretion that the person
claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent
of this discretion is in question, the V ice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this
discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the
abuse of discretion standard). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a
Member or Dependant (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the V ice President, or a party designated by the V ice President,
will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the V ice President, a comprehensible
written notice setting forth:
23
(1) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(2) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(3) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim
and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(4) A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).
If the V ice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may
extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the V ice President will notify the claimant before the end of the
initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President expects
to make the final decision. Upon review , the V ice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including
the opportunity to submit to the V ice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim and the
Vice President’ s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was
submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request
for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the
extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances
requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in
writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with
references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon
request and free of char ge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of
the record before the V ice President at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the
claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section.
7.04    Limitations on Actions.
Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current
Employee, Member , Dependant or any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful
denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of
this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than
earlier of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action; (ii) the
date identified to the Petitioner by the V ice President on which payments shall commence; or (iii) when he has actual
24
or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this
two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action.
Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process described above shall have no ef fect on this
two-year time frame.
7.05    Restriction of V enue.
Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall only
be brought or filed in the state or federal courts of New Y ork, specifically the state or federal court, whichever applies, located
nearest the Corporation’ s headquarters.
7.06    Effect of Specific Refer ences.
Specific references in the Plan to the V ice President’ s discretion shall create no inference that the V ice President’ s discretion
in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.
25

While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely , it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance.
The Corporation hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time
provided, however , that no such amendment or termination shall adversely af fect the amount of benefit to which a Member or his
Dependant is entitled under the Plan on the date of such amendment or termination, unless the Member becomes entitled to an
amount equal to such benefit under another plan or practice adopted by the Corporation. Specific forms of payment are not
protected under the preceding sentence.

employees of the remaining Employers.
26
ARTICLE IX - MISCELLANEOUS
9.01    Unfunded Plan.
The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable when
due out of the Employer ’s general funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this
Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer .
9.02    Costs of the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, char ges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and
management of the Plan shall be the costs, char ges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on the

expense is incurred.
9.03    Temporary Absence of Member .
If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, dischar ge, retirement or quitting ( e.g., sickness, accident,
layof f, vacation), he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is
absent, unless the V ice President determines otherwise. If the Member ’s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-time
member of the armed forces of any country or of any or ganization engaged in national service of any such country , he shall not be
deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he shall
resign permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur .
9.04    Taxes, Etc.
In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the V ice President to be owing in respect of any benefit
payable from the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment or
other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty .
9.05    Nonguarantee of Employment.
Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as a
right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to
dischar ge any of its employees, with or without cause.
27
9.06    No Right to Benefits.
No person, whether or not being a Member , shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by the
terms of the Plan. In the event of a Member ’s termination of employment by an Employer , the resulting cessation of his Active
Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer or any
member of the PepsiCo Or ganization with respect to such termination.
9.07    Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments.
 
All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand char ged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all
sums in respect of losses to a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the
Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer of proof satisfactory to the V ice President that
any such loss ought to be made good by a Member . The relevant amount shall be deductible from the Member ’s benefits and be
payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Or ganization whose receipt shall be a valid dischar ge for the same.
Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not
exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that
specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable, and the person to whom they are payable. Accordingly ,
any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of which are
hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored promptly to the
Plan. In exchange for Member or Dependant status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or claim of right from
the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment grants to the Plan the
following nonexclusive rights –
(1)    A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or
indirectly from the Plan and that is, in whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the
amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such
payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a
person, trust fund or entity).
(2)    The right to of fset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest) other
payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however , reliance on this
right is in the discretion of the V ice President, and the existence of an opportunity to apply it shall not diminish the
Plan’ s rights under paragraph (1) above.
(3)    The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement of
any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of an
28
Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may
correspond to such party’ s present or future residence.
Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the V ice President that are in
furtherance of the Plan’ s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall
maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way ,
including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.
9.08    Termination for Cause; Pr ohibited Misconduct.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the V ice President determines that a Member
has been terminated for cause or engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of the date
his or her employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization terminates, the Member shall forfeit his Pension (whether paid
previously , being paid currently or payable in the future), and his or her Pension shall be adjusted to reflect such forfeiture
and any previously paid Pension payments shall be recovered. As a condition to Membership in this Plan, each Member
agrees to this, and each Member agrees to repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section 9.08.
(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly , by a Member shall constitute Prohibited
Misconduct:
(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility , or acquiring any
ownership interest, which involves the Member ’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that
markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business entity makes
retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(2) The Member , directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member ’s
recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Or ganization employee to leave the
PepsiCo Or ganization’ s employment or to accept any position with any other entity .
(3) The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo
Organization other than as necessary in his or her position with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Such confidential

PepsiCo Or ganization. Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the PepsiCo
Organization’ s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition tar gets; its business operations and
structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes,
29
machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.

interests, including violating the Corporation’ s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of
the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment with the
PepsiCo Or ganization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(5) The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Member from
communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Corporation,
participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for providing information to government
authorities. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any information
appropriately protected by the privilege. Further , pursuant to the Defend T rade Secrets Act, an individual shall not be held
criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i)

for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document
filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by
an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use
the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret
under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order .
For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director , officer,
employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or
suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business entity

Organization during the Member ’s employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
30
9.09    Notices.
Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be suf ficiently given
to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the V ice President. In any case where under the Plan any notice shall
be required to be given to Members, it shall be suf ficient if such notice is delivered to the Member ’s last known address on file in
the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method ( e.g., electronically) that the V ice President
determines is reasonably available to the Member .
9.10    Plan Documentation.
Every Member shall on demand be entitled to a copy of the governing legal document for the DB Program.
9.11    Curr ency of Payment.
Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars, or other "eligible currency ," as approved by the

time.
9.12    Governing Law .
The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New Y ork.
9.13    Exemption fr om ERISA.
The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), as
a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens
of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA, both Active Membership in the Plan and the opportunity to
increase Highest A verage Monthly Earnings after ceasing to be an Active Member , in accordance with Section 4.04(b), shall be
limited to individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United
States, and it is intended that all permanent records and documentation relating to the administration of the Plan shall be kept at a
location that is outside of the United States.
9.14    Exemption fr om Section 409A.
In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section
409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, ef fective for any period to
which Section 409A applies. It is the
31
intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit from the Plan vest, increase or in any
way be enhanced (collectively , a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their compensation or service while a U.S. Person.
Accordingly , no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is determined,
following the close of such year , that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year . Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, in the calendar year a Member ’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the V ice President may authorize a
Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the V ice President determines satisfactorily that
the Member will not be a U.S. Person for such year . In other cases, the Member ’s benefit will commence under this Plan without
any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate adjustments will be made to the
Member ’s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year of
commencement. This Section 9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that
benefits and any other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A , and the V ice President shall have
such unrestricted authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this requirement.

TABLE A - CALCULA TION OF PENSIONS
This section sets forth the formulas for calculating the Pension payable to a Member under Article IV or the Death Benefit
payable to a Member ’s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable, under Article VI. Any benefits accrued under
the DB Program by a Member while a part-time employee, following such Member ’s designation by the V ice President as an
Eligible Employee pursuant to the last sentence of the definition of Eligible Employee in Section 2.01, shall be prorated as
determined by the V ice President to reflect the approximate ratio of the Member ’s level of services during such part-time status to
the level required for full-time status at the Member ’s work location.
(I)    Member ’s Pension
(a)    The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date for Members who
became members of the Plan before January 1, 1976 shall be the larger of the Pension calculated under this paragraph (a) or under
paragraph (b) below . The Pension under this paragraph (a) shall be the greater  of (1) or (2) below:
(1)    1.5 percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the
number of years of Pensionable Service; or
(2)    3 percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary , multiplied by the number of years of his
Pensionable Service but not exceeding 15 years.
(b)    The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date (i) for Members who
became members of the Plan on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) for persons (other than those in (i)) who became Members on or
after September 1, 1980, and (iii) for persons (other than in (i) or (ii)) who became Members after November 12, 1998, shall be the
Pension calculated under this paragraph (b). The pension calculated under this paragraph (b) shall be the aggregate of:
(1)    For up to the first 10 years of Pensionable Service, the product of (i) 3 percent of the Member ’s Highest
Average Monthly Salary , multiplied by (ii) the number of years of Pensionable Service, but not exceeding 10 such years;
plus
(2)    For any years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10, the product of (i) 1 percent of the Member ’s Highest
Average Monthly Salary , multiplied by (ii) the number of years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10.
(c)    At the discretion of the V ice President, the Pension calculated as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be
reduced by some or all of the following:
34
(1)    All state pension and social security benefits receivable by the Member attributable to Service other than those
derived from unmatched and unreimbursed voluntary contributions made by the Member;
(2)    The annuity equivalent of a like portion of all capital sum benefits receivable by the Member on or by reason
of his retirement either from a state source or from the Employer in consequence of a requirement of local legislation,
including, but not limited to, termination indemnities;
(3)    Any benefits payable to the Member (or in respect of him) from other retirement benefit plans (or cash
allowance received in lieu of Employer contributions to a retirement benefit plan) of the Employers in respect of any period
of employment which qualifies as Pensionable Service both under the DB Program and under such other retirement benefit
plans of the Employers;
(4)    Any other payment made by the Employer at the time of termination of the Member that arises from any
severance agreement made between the Employer and Member , for whatsoever reason;
(5)    The value (as determined in accordance with methodology approved by the V ice President) of any benefits
paid to the Member prior to his retirement from any plan in respect of any period of employment which qualifies as
Pensionable Service both under the DB Program and under such other retirement benefit plans of the Employers;
(6)    Any deductions, reductions or forfeiture of a Member's benefits resulting from a Member's misdemeanor ,
misconduct or dischar ge for cause pursuant to Section 9.08 hereof.
No such deduction shall be made in respect of any such benefits as are derived from unmatched and unreimbursed voluntary
contributions made by the Member . The value of all such deductions shall be subject to adjustment to reflect the form and timing of
payment. All deductions set out in this paragraph (c) shall be calculated as of the Member ’s termination date and in accordance
with methodology approved by the V ice President from time to time.
(d)    If the Pension payable to or on behalf of a Member is reduced under paragraph (c) above, an alternative calculation of
the Pension for such Member shall apply unless the V ice President determines that the alternative calculation would be unnecessary
or impractical or would not serve the purposes of the DB Program. Under this alternative calculation, only the Member ’s
Pensionable Service under this DB Program, which does not include any employment that is taken into account in determining
benefits under paragraph (c)(1) - (5), shall be considered, and the reductions under paragraph (c)(1) - (5) shall be disregarded
(however , the reduction under paragraph (c)(6) shall be taken into account). If this alternative calculation applies, the Pension
payable under this alternative calculation shall be compared to the Pension payable under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, and
whichever provides the greater Pension amount will be payable to or on behalf of the Member , subject to the remaining provisions
of this
35
paragraph (d). The alternative calculation set forth in this paragraph (d) is intended to provide a calculation methodology that
replicates the ef fect of the “extended wearaway” calculation methodology , as it is in ef fect from time to time under the PepsiCo
Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this paragraph (d), any benefit increase provided as a result of this paragraph
(d) will be limited so that in the judgment of the V ice President it is not in excess of what should be available given the intent
described in the preceding sentence.
(e)    For purposes of this T able A, "Highest A verage Monthly Salary" means one twelfth of the yearly average of the
Member ’s Salary over any 5 consecutive calendar years of Service in which such Salary was highest (or over such lesser period as
the Member has been in Service). For purposes of determining a Member's Highest A verage Monthly Salary , the following shall
apply:
(1)    A calendar year with no Salary shall be disregarded, and the calendar years preceding and following such
calendar year (or years) shall be considered consecutive.
(2)    If in a calendar year there is an unpaid authorised leave of absence, or other absence from paid service, that
results in less than a complete year of Salary , such calendar year shall be disregarded and the next preceding or succeeding
year or years shall be taken into account if it results in a higher average.
(f)    In determining the amount of a Deferred V ested Pension for the purposes of Section 4.04, the Pension shall be equal to
the greatest of the amounts determined under subsection (1), (2) or (3) below:
(1)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would have
earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Age (subject to a maximum of 35 years) and
Highest A verage Monthly Salary as of September 30, 2003, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member ’s
actual years of Pensionable Service prior to October 1, 2003 (subject to a maximum of 35 years) and the denominator of
which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal
Retirement Age.
(2)    The aggregate of:
(i)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member
would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and Highest A verage
Monthly Salary as of September 30, 2003, reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member ’s actual
years of Pensionable Service prior to October 1, 2003 and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable
Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date; and
36
(ii)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member
would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date and the Highest A verage
Monthly Salary at the date the Member ceases to be in Service,  reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Member ’s actual years of Pensionable Service after September 30, 2003 and the denominator of which is the years
of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date.
(3)    The Pension calculated as provided in (b) above, but based on the Pensionable Service the Member would have
earned had he remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date  and the Highest A verage Monthly Salary at
the date the Member ceases to be in Service,  reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Member ’s actual years of
Pensionable Service and the denominator of which is the years of Pensionable Service he would have earned had he
remained an Active Member until his Normal Retirement Date.
For Members who became Members of the Plan before January 1, 1976, the Deferred V ested Pension shall be the
larger of 1½ percent of the Member ’s Highest A verage Monthly Salary multiplied by the Member ’s number of years of
Pensionable Service at termination or the amount determined by the V ice President based on actuarial information provided
to the V ice President.
All deductions set out in (c) above that are applicable to a Member entitled to a Deferred V ested Pension shall be calculated
as of the time such Member ceases to be in Service and in accordance with methodology approved by the V ice President.
(II)    Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension
If a Member covered by Section 6.01 dies after  the date he would have been entitled to retire early under Section 4.02, the
Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension, as applicable, shall be 50 percent of the Pension
to which the Member would have been entitled if he had retired on the day preceding his death (having elected a 50 Percent
Survivor Annuity calculated in accordance with Section 5.02(b)) and reduced in accordance with Section 4.02 if the Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner commences the Pre-Retirement Souse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s
Pension, as applicable, prior to the date the Member would have attained age 62.
If a Member covered by Section 6.01 dies befor e the date he would have been entitled to retire early under Section 4.02, the
Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension, as applicable, shall be 50 percent of the Pension
to which the Member would have been entitled if he had attained the right to receive a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity calculated in
accordance with Section 5.02(b)), payable as of the first of the month following the later of death or the date the Member would
have attained age 55, and reduced in accordance with Section 4.04(c) if the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner
commences the Pre-
37
Retirement Souse’ s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s Pension, as applicable, prior to the date the Member would have
attained age 65.

ARTICLE I – HIST ORY AND GENERAL INFORMA TION
PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Corporation”) first established the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan ef fective as of September 1,
1980. The Plan at that time was comprised of the “PepsiCo International Retirement Plan T rust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules.”
The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety , effective September 2, 1982.
The Plan was again amended and restated ef fective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became the “Plan A Rules”
(applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation’ s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo International Retirement
Plan T rust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they arise) took ef fect.
The Plan was further amended ef fective January 1, 2005, to provide that no person subject to taxation in the United States
of America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but
instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated Company permanently before becoming subject
to U.S. taxation.
 
Effective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form one Plan
document. The amendment and restatement referred to in the prior sentence remains in ef fect, and it sets forth the terms of the “DB
Program.”
Effective January 1, 201 1, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit
selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate ( i.e., employees on assignments outside of their
home countries for whom it is judged to be impractical to have them participate in their home country retirement plans, and
employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the DC
Program are set forth in this document, which is the governing legal document for the DC Program. Together , the DC Program and
the DB Program set forth the terms of a single Plan. The DC Program is also sometimes referred to in employee communications as
the PepsiCo International Pension Plan or “PIPP .”
The DC Program was previously amended and restated, ef fective as of January 1, 2016. As part of that amendment and
restatement, the Corporation modified the DC Program to also benefit selected employees: (i) who are localized to a country
outside of their home country , (ii) were participating in a defined benefit or defined contribution retirement program sponsored
immediately prior to their localization and (iii) for whom no company-provided retirement program is available.
The DC Program is hereby amended and restated ef fective as of January 1, 2019.
At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
1
(“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that executive’ s individual employer . With respect to his employer , the
executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor . The Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained
outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United
States.

the United States Internal Revenue Service for the month of September immediately preceding the first day of the Plan Y ear
to which an Interest Credit relates. The V ice President shall have the discretion to change from time to time the basis for

(v) “Salary ” means (i) home notional base salary in the case of an Eligible Employee who is not paid on a United

authorize the Eligible Employee’ s Salary to be increased to reflect an amount of notional bonus that is paid to such Eligible

made by the V ice President and shall be conclusive and binding on all Eligible Employees .
(w) “Service ” means the period during which an Eligible Employee was continuously in employment (including all

an individual has become a Member) shall break the continuity of an individual’ s Service, and employment before the break
in service will only be counted as Service if it would otherwise qualify under this subsection and the V ice President

Employee to the status of an Eligible Employee of an Approved Employer , his pre-transfer period of employment with an
Employer may be counted as Service only with the approval of the V ice President. Similarly , for an individual who transfers
from employment with an Approved Employer as an Eligible Employee to other employment with an Employer , his post-

7701(b)(4). In addition, a person shall be considered a U.S. Person for purposes of Section 9.14 in any year for which the

Organization for such year .
(z) “Valuation date ” means each business day , as determined by the V ice President, as of which Members’ PIRP-DC

the last day of each Plan Y ear. In addition, to the extent provided in Section 4.02, the DC Program shall have a special
Valuation Date prior to the end of a Plan Y ear for Active Members who have an Approved T ransfer (and for certain Active
Members who have a Status Change) as described in Section 4.02. In accordance with procedures that may be adopted by
the V ice President, any current V aluation Date may be changed (but in such case adjustments shall apply in the operation of
the DC Program as necessary to prevent duplicate or disproportionate benefits, as determined by the V ice President).  Values
are determined as of the close of a V aluation Date or , if such date is not a business day , as of the close of the preceding

(aa) “Vice President ” means the V ice President, Global Benefits & W ellness of PepsiCo, Inc., but if such position is

8
(b) Determining Periods of Y ears:  For the purposes of the DC Program, any period of 365 consecutive days (or of
366 consecutive days, if the period includes 29th February) shall be deemed to constitute a year , but not so that in the
calculation of a number of years any day is counted more than once. Where the amount of a benefit depends upon the
calculation of a number of years or months without expressly requiring that these should be complete years or months, a
proportionate amount ( i.e., a number of days) may be given for any part of a year or month which would not otherwise be
included in the calculation.  Where this document makes reference to months or parts of a year , or to any other period of
time except a day , week or year the V ice President may authorize the period to be counted in days or complete calendar
months with each calendar month counted as 1/12th of a year .
(c) Compounds of the W ord “Here”:  The words “hereof” and “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the word
“here” shall mean and refer to the entire DC Program, not to any particular provision or section.     
(d) Examples:  Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item or
items, or there is a passage having a similar ef fect, such passages of the document shall be construed as if the phrase
“without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limitation
on its breadth of application).
(e) Subdivisions of this Document:  This document is divided and subdivided using the following progression:
articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals.
Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower -case letters in
parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower -case
roman numerals in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper -case letters in parentheses. Any reference in a section to a
subsection (with no accompanying section reference) shall be read as a reference to the subsection with the specified
designation contained in that same section. A similar rule shall apply with respect to paragraph references within a
subsection and subparagraph references within a paragraph.
9
ARTICLE III – MEMBERSHIP
3.01    Eligibility for Membership.
Every person who the V ice President determines is an Eligible Employee shall be eligible for Membership.
3.02    Admission to Membership.
Every person who the V ice President determines is an Eligible Employee, and who is not during the relevant time a U.S.
Person, shall, following the approval of his Membership by the V ice President, be admitted to Membership ef fective as of his Entry
Date. For this purpose, the relevant time includes a suf ficient period before the Eligible Employee’ s Proposed Entry Date as is
necessary to avoid PIRP-DC Accounts being considered deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the United States
Internal Revenue Code. No Eligible Employee or any other person shall be admitted to Membership without the approval of the
Vice President.
3.03    Active and Inactive Membership.
A Member shall be an Active Member during the period that he is – (a) employed as an Eligible Employee, (b) not a U.S.
Person, and (c) currently approved for status as an Active Member by the V ice President. A Member shall be an Inactive Member
during any period that he does not currently meet all of the requirements to be an Active Member .
10
ARTICLE IV – CONTRIBUTIONS
4.01    Contributions.
To the extent provided in subsections (a) and (b) below , the Employer shall allocate Pay Credits and Interest Credits to a
Member ’s PIRP-DC Account, each determined by the V ice President as follows –
(a) Pay Credit . To receive a Pay Credit for a Plan Y ear, an individual must be an Active Member during such year .
The amount of an Active Member ’s Pay Credit for a Plan Y ear shall be determined by multiplying the Active Member ’s
annualized Salary in ef fect as of that year ’s Valuation Date by the Active Member ’s applicable percentage, which shall be
one of the following: 5%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 18%. The V ice President shall specify the Active Member ’s applicable
percentage as of the Active Member ’s Entry Date. For each subsequent Plan Y ear that the individual is an Active Member ,
the V ice President may specify a new applicable percentage that shall apply to the Active Member for such Plan Y ear.
(b) Interest Credit . To receive an Interest Credit for a Plan Y ear, an individual must be either an Active Member or
Inactive Member during such year , and the individual must have had a balance in his PIRP-DC Account as of the prior Plan
Year’s Valuation Date. The amount of a Member ’s Interest Credit shall be determined by the V ice President by multiplying
the Interest Rate for the period since the last V aluation Date by the balance of the Member ’s PIRP-DC Account as of such
last V aluation Date.
A Member ’s Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined by the V ice President as soon as administratively practicable after
each V aluation Date. If a Member has less than one full year of Active Membership since such last V aluation Date ( e.g., as may
apply in the Member ’s first and last year of Membership), the Member ’s Pay Credit as otherwise determined under subsection (a)
above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member ’s fractional year of Active Membership. If a Member has less than
one full year of Membership since such last V aluation Date, any Interest Credit as otherwise available and determined under
subsection (b) above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member ’s fractional year of Membership ( e.g., as may apply
in the Member ’s last year of Membership). A fractional year shall be computed by dividing the Member ’s days of Membership or
Active Membership (as applicable) during the Plan Y ear by the total number of days in such Plan Y ear. A period of paid leave of
absence during a Plan Y ear shall be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member ’s Pay Credit
for the Plan Y ear in accordance with the prior sentence. However , a period of unpaid leave of absence during a Plan Y ear shall not
be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member ’s Pay Credit for the Plan Y ear in accordance
with the prior sentence (and as a result, the Pay Credit for the Plan Y ear containing the unpaid leave shall be prorated, or there shall
be no Pay Credit, all as necessary to limit Pay Credits to the Member ’s period of Active Membership during the Plan Y ear). In the
event a prorated Pay Credit and Interest Credit relate to the Member ’s final year of Membership, the Pay
11
Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined as of the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date (with proration based upon the
Member ’s fractional final year of Membership). The calculation of the Pay Credit and Interest Credit by the V ice President shall be
conclusive and binding on all Members (and their Dependants).
4.02    Offsets.
Notwithstanding Section 4.01, the Corporation may reduce the amount of any payment or benefit that is or would become
payable to or on behalf of a Member by the amount of any obligation of the Member to the Corporation or by the amount of –
(a) Any material benefits accrued by the Member under a retirement plan sponsored by the Corporation or by any
country , state, province or other political subdivision or locality , to the extent the V ice President determines that the benefit
amount under such retirement plan is for Service or Salary that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits under the DC
Program, and
(b) Any termination indemnity or other payment to the Member by the Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization related to
the Member ’s termination of employment, to the extent the V ice President determines that the payment is reasonably related
to Service that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits under the DC Program.
Consistent with the foregoing, appropriate reductions may be made in the Pay Credits and Interest Credits that otherwise would be
provided to the Member under Sections 4.01 and 4.02, the balance in the Member ’s PIRP-DC Account under Article V , or the
Member ’s distributions under Article VI. The determination of whether a benefit is material and all other aspects of the application
of this Section 4.02 is solely in the independent discretion of the V ice President.
12
ARTICLE V – MEMBER ACCOUNTS
5.01    Accounting for Members’ Inter ests.
Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be credited to a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account as of the V aluation Date to which such
credits relate (or , in the case of Pay Credits and Interest Credits that relate to the Member ’s final year of Membership, as of the
Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date) or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter . A Member ’s PIRP-DC Account is a
bookkeeping device to track the notional value of the Member ’s Pay Credits and Interest Credits (and his Employer ’s liability for
such credits). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any PIRP-DC Account, and no PIRP-DC Account shall
be funded, insured or otherwise secured.
5.02    Vesting.
Subject to Sections 4.02 and 9.14, a Member shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, his PIRP-DC
Account upon completing 3 years of Service, or if earlier , upon the death or disability of the Member while employed by the
Employer or PepsiCo Or ganization. The determination of whether a Member has become disabled for this purpose shall be made
by the V ice President in accordance with such standards as the V ice President deems to be appropriate as of the time in question.
5.03    Special V esting for Appr oved T ransfers and Status Changes.
(a) Automatic Special V esting for Approved T ransfers.  Notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an Active
Member who will have an Approved T ransfer during a Plan Y ear, the Active Member shall automatically have special
vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of – (a) the Active Member ’s Approved T ransfer , or (b) the day
the Active Member would become a U.S. Person in connection with the Approved T ransfer .
(b) Special V esting for Status Changes . Also notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an Active Member
who will have a Status Change, the Active Member may request that the V ice President apply special vesting to him as of
the last business day before the Active Member ’s Status Change. In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to
be valid and ef fective under the DC Program, the Active Member ’s request and the V ice President’ s approval of the request
must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies.
Subject to the next sentence, the ef fect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b)
above is that the Member will become vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 5.02 if the Member vested under that
Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 5.03, rights under
this Section 5.03 are subject to the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and
13
other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this
Section 5.03 shall not apply to the extent inconsistent with this requirement.
14
ARTICLE VI – DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS
6.01    Distribution Rules Generally .
A Member ’s PIRP-DC Account shall be distributed based upon first to occur of the Member ’s termination of employment
with the PepsiCo Or ganization or death, as provided in Sections 6.02 and 6.03 respectively , subject to Section 4.06 (vesting). All
distributions shall be made in cash.
6.02    Distributions Upon T ermination of Employment.
If a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his termination of employment with the PepsiCo
Organization, such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first of the month that immediately follows the
Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date. In the case of a Member whose termination of employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization
occurs as a result of the Member becoming disabled, for purposes of this Section, the determination of whether such Member is
disabled and the date on which such Member ’s termination of employment is considered to occur shall be made by the V ice
President.
6.03    Distributions Upon Death.
If a Member ’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his death, such distribution shall be made in a single
lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows the Member ’s Distribution V aluation Date. Amounts paid
following a Member ’s death shall be paid to the Member ’s Dependant; provided, however , that if no Dependant designation is in
effect at the time of the Member ’s death (as determined by the V ice President), or if all persons designated as Dependants have
predeceased the Member , then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed to the Member ’s Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable, or , if the Member does not have an Eligible Spouse or an Eligible Domestic
Partner at the time of his death, to his estate.
6.04    Valuation.
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Member ’s PIRP-DC Account shall
continue to be credited with Interest Credits (and debited for expenses) as specified in Article V until the Member ’s Distribution
Valuation Date.
6.05    Designation of Dependant.
A Member shall designate one or more Dependants who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member
shall have the right to change or revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the ef fective date of such election. If the
Member is married at the time he or she designates a Dependant(s), any designation under this section of a Dependant(s) who is not
the Member ’s Eligible Spouse shall require the written consent of the
15
Member ’s Eligible Spouse. A revocation of a Dependant(s) does not require consent by the Member ’s Eligible Spouse. The
designation of any Dependant(s), and any change or revocation thereof, and any written consent of a Member ’s Eligible Spouse
required by this Section shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the V ice President, shall be made in writing on forms
provided by the V ice President, and shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the V ice President.
16
ARTICLE VII – ADMINISTRA TION
7.01    Authority to Administer Plan.
(a) Administration by the V ice President:  The Plan shall be administered by the V ice President, who shall have the
authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the V ice President
hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations, determinations and regulations made or issued by the
Vice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned.
(b) Authority to Delegate:  The V ice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other
persons or entities, or designate or employ other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions
under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the V ice President shall, to the extent applicable, refer to such
action by the V ice President’ s delegate or other designated person.
7.02    Facility of Payment.
Whenever , in the opinion of the V ice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit hereunder is under a
legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the V ice President may direct that
payments from the Plan be made to such person’ s legal representative for his benefit, or that the payment be applied for the benefit
of such person in such manner as the V ice President considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall be a complete dischar ge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of the
Plan.
7.03    Claims Pr ocedur e.
The V ice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all
questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits, and his decisions on such matters are final and
conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the V ice President decides in his discretion that the person
claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent
of this discretion is in question, the V ice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this
discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the
abuse of discretion standard). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a
Member or Dependant (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the V ice President, or a party designated by the V ice President,
will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the V ice President, a comprehensible
written notice setting forth:
17
(a) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(b) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to perfect the claim
and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(d) A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).
If the V ice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may
extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the V ice President will notify the claimant before the end of the
initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President expects
to make the final decision. Upon review , the V ice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim, including
the opportunity to submit to the V ice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the claim and the
Vice President’ s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was
submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request
for review , unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the
extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances
requiring the extension and the date by which the V ice President expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in
writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with
references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon
request and free of char ge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his claim for benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of
the record before the V ice President at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the
claimant’ s having fully exhausted all rights under this section.
7.04    Limitations on Actions.
Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current
Employee, Member , Dependant or any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful
denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of
this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than
earlier of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action; (ii) the
date identified to the Petitioner by the V ice President on which payment shall be made; or (ii) when he has actual or
18
constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this
two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action.
Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process described above shall have no ef fect on this
two-year time frame.
7.05    Restriction of V enue.
Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall only
be brought or filed in the state or federal courts of New Y ork, specifically the state or federal court, whichever applies, located
nearest the Corporation’ s headquarters.
7.06    Effect of Specific Refer ences.
Specific references in the Plan to the V ice President’ s discretion shall create no inference that the V ice President’ s discretion
in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.
19
ARTICLE VIII – AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
8.01    Continuation of the Plan.
While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely , it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance.
The Corporation hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time
provided, however , that no such amendment or termination shall reduce the balance (determined as of the date of such amendment
or termination) in the Plan account maintained for the benefit of a Member or his Dependant, except to the extent the Member
becomes entitled to an amount under another plan or practice maintained by an Employer . Specific forms (including times) of
payment are not protected under the preceding sentence.
8.02    Amendment.
The Corporation may , in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to this Plan from time to time, with or
without retroactive ef fect, subject to Section 8.01. An Employer (other than the Corporation) shall not have the right to amend the
Plan.
8.03    Termination.
The Corporation may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers. If
the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the Employers, the Plan shall continue in ef fect for the benefit of the
employees of the remaining Employers.
20
ARTICLE IX – MISCELLANEOUS
9.01    Unfunded Plan.
The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable when
due out of the Employer ’s general funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this
Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer .
9.02    Costs of the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, char ges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and
management of the Plan shall be the costs, char ges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on the
proportion of Members who are employed by such Employer as compared to the total number of Members at the time the cost or
expense is incurred.
9.03    Temporary Absence of Member .
If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, dischar ge, retirement or quitting ( e.g., sickness, accident,
layof f, vacation), he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is
absent, unless the V ice President determines otherwise. If the Member ’s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-time
member of the armed forces of any country or of any or ganization engaged in national service of any such country , he shall not be
deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he shall
resign permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur .
9.04    Taxes, Etc.
In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the V ice President to be owing in respect of any benefit
payable from the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment or
other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty .
9.05    Nonguarantee of Employment.
Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as a
right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to
dischar ge any of its employees, with or without cause.
21
9.06    No Right to Benefits.
No person, whether or not being a Member , shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by the
terms of the Plan. In the event of a Member ’s termination of employment by an Employer , the resulting cessation of his
Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer or any
member of the PepsiCo Or ganization with respect to such termination.
9.07    Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments.
 
All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand char ged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all
sums in respect of losses to a member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the
Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Or ganization or Employer of proof satisfactory to the V ice President that
any such loss ought to be made good by a Member . The relevant amount shall be deductible from the Member ’s benefits and be
payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Or ganization whose receipt shall be a valid dischar ge for the same.
Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not
exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that
specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable, and the person to whom they are payable. Accordingly ,
any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of which are
hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored promptly to the
Plan. In exchange for Member or beneficiary status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or claim of right from
the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment grants to the Plan the
following nonexclusive rights –
(1)    A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or
indirectly from the Plan and that is, in whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the
amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such
payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a
person, trust fund or entity).
(2)    The right to of fset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest) other
payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however , reliance on this
right is in the discretion of the V ice President, and the existence of an opportunity to apply it shall not diminish the
Plan’ s rights under paragraph (1) above.
(3)    The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement of
any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of an
22
Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may
correspond to such party’ s present or future residence.
Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the V ice President that are in
furtherance of the Plan’ s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall
maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way ,
including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.
9.08    Pr ohibited Misconduct.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the V ice President determines that a Member
has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his termination of employment with
the PepsiCo Or ganization, the Member shall forfeit all Pay Credits and Interest Credits (whether paid previously , being paid
currently or payable in the future), and his PIRP-DC Account shall be adjusted to reflect such forfeiture and previously paid
Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be recovered. As a condition to Membership in this Plan, each Member agrees to this
and each Member agrees to repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section 9.08.
(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly , by a Member shall constitute Prohibited
Misconduct:
(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility , or acquiring any
ownership interest, which involves the Member ’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that
markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business entity makes
retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(2) The Member , directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member ’s
recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Or ganization employee to leave the
PepsiCo Or ganization’ s employment or to accept any position with any other entity .
(3) The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo
Organization other than as necessary in his position with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Such confidential information
shall include all non-public information the Member acquired as a result of his positions with the PepsiCo
Organization. Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the PepsiCo
Organization’ s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition tar gets; its business operations and
structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes,
23
machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
(4) The Member engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s best
interests, including violating the Corporation’ s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of
the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his employment with the
PepsiCo Or ganization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(5) The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Member from
communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Corporation,
participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for providing information to government
authorities. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any information
appropriately protected by the privilege. Further , pursuant to the Defend T rade Secrets Act, an individual shall not be held
criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i)
in confidence to a federal, state, or local government of ficial, either directly or indirectly , or to an attorney; and (ii) solely
for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document
filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by
an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use
the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret
under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order .
For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director , officer,
employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or
suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business entity
or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products” shall mean any product that falls
into one or more of the following categories, so long as the PepsiCo Or ganization is producing, marketing, selling or
licensing such product anywhere in the world – beverages, including without limitation carbonated soft drinks, tea, water ,
juice drinks, sports drinks, cof fee drinks, ener gy drinks, and value-added dairy drinks; juices and juice products; dairy
products; snacks, including salty snacks, sweet snacks meat snacks, granola and cereal bars, and cookies; hot cereals;
pancake mixes; value-added rice products; pancake syrups; value-added pasta products; ready-to-eat cereals; dry pasta
products; or any product or service that the Member had reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo
Organization during the Member ’s employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
24
9.09    Notices.
Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be suf ficiently given
to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the V ice President. In any case where under the Plan any notice shall
be required to be given to Members, it shall be suf ficient if such notice is delivered to the Member ’s last known address on file in
the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method ( e.g., electronically) that the V ice President
determines is reasonably available to the Member .
9.10    Plan Documentation.
Every Member shall on demand be entitled to a copy of the Plan.
9.11    Curr ency of Payment.
Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars, or other "eligible currency ," as approved by the
Vice President. The amount otherwise payable in United States dollars would be converted to the selected currency using the
exchange rate, based on the methodology approved by the V ice President from time to time.
9.12    Governing Law .
The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New Y ork.
9.13    Exemption fr om ERISA.
The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), as
a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens
of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA, Active Membership in the Plan shall be limited to
individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United States, and it
is intended that all permanent records and documentation relating to the administration of the Plan shall be kept at a location that is
outside of the United States.
9.14    Exemption fr om Section 409A.
In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section
409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, ef fective for any period to
which Section 409A applies. It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit
from the Plan vest, increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively , a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their compensation or
service while a U.S. Person. However , Interest Credits may be
25
provided on the PIRP-DC Account of a Member who is a U.S. Person, but only to the extent the balance in the PIRP-DC Account
is derived from Pay Credits that relate to Service completed while the Member was not a U.S. Person (and Interest Credits on such
Pay Credits). Accordingly , no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is
determined, following the close of such year , that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year . Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, in the calendar year a Member ’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the V ice President may
authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the V ice President determines
satisfactorily that the Member will not be a U.S. Person for such year . In other cases, the Member ’s benefit will commence under
this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate adjustments will be
made to the Member ’s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year
of commencement. This Section 9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement
that allocations, benefits and rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A , and the V ice President shall
have such unrestricted authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this requirement.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
ARTICLE I  
Foreword     
The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the
benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the PepsiCo Salaried Employees
Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the
Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP
provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula (see, for example, Part B
thereof).
1989 Restatement . The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety in 1989.
409A Program Document 2005 Restatement . The Plan was last amended and restated in its entirety
effective as of January 1, 2005. The 2005 restatement sets forth the terms of the Plan that are applicable to benefits
that are subject to Section 409A, i.e., generally , benefits that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 or
materially modified within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4) (the “409A Program”).
Amendments to the 2005 Restatement . The 2005 restatement was amended to reflect the merger into
this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), ef fective at the end of the day on December 31, 201 1.
The PBG PEP document that was in ef fect on April 1, 2009, as amended through January 1, 201 1 (the “409A PBG
PEP Document”) is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG 409A and shall continue to govern PBG PEP benefits that
were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger , except for certain administrative provisions that
are now governed by the main portion of the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is
- 1 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
explained in Appendix Article PBG 409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are
subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”) under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP
Documents as a result of the merger or the revisions to the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document and 409A PBG PEP
Document.
2017 and 2019 Restatements . This restatement of the 409A Program Document is ef fective as of January
1, 2019. Before this restatement, the 409A Program Document was most recently restated ef fective as of January 1,
2017.
Interplay of this 409A Program and Pre-409A Program . All benefits under the Plan that are not subject to
the 409A Program (i.e., generally , benefits that are earned or vested before January 1, 2005 and not materially
modified thereafter within the meaning of T reas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4)) shall be governed by the Plan Document for
the Pre-Section 409 Program (the “Pre-409A Program”). Together , this document and the document for the Pre ‑ 409A
Program describe the terms of a single plan. However , amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and
amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the
terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts
and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be suf ficient to permit the pre-409A Program to remain exempt
from Section 409A as grandfathered benefits.

ARTICLE II  
Definitions and Construction     
2.1    Definitions : This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases listed below . Where the
following words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan document (including the Foreword) with
initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below , unless a dif ferent meaning is plainly required by the context.
Accrued Benefit : The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance with
Article V , based on the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date of
determination.
Actuarial Equivalent : Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to the
Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of the
factors set forth below . The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable
under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner . In the event the Plan is amended to provide
new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless
specifically adopted by the amendment.
(1)    Annuities and Inflation Protection : To determine the amount of a Pension payable in
the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity , as an annuity with
inflation protection, or as a period certain and life annuity , the Plan Administrator shall select the factors
that are to be used. Effective January 1, 2009, the factors
- 3 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
selected by the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1, below (prior factors appear in the
Appendix). Thereafter , the Plan Administrator shall review such factors for forms of payment (including
for annuities and lump sums) from time to time and shall amend such factors in its discretion. In general,
a Participant shall have no right to have any of the actuarial factors specified for forms of payment under
the Plan from time to time applied to his benefit (or any portion thereof), except to the extent that a
particular factor is currently in ef fect at the time it is to be applied under the Plan. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is expressly intended and binding upon Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of
payment selected by the Plan Administrator from time-to-time may be applied retroactively to already
accrued benefits, and without regard to the actuarial factors that may have applied previously for such
purpose. However , in adjusting benefits under the Plan using those factors in Schedule 1 (below) that
become ef fective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, the right to receive a benefit that
is not less than would have applied under the prior basis for this adjustment shall apply to the same
extent (and in the same manner) as applies under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried
Plan Factors. For this purpose, the phrase “2019 Salaried Plan Factors” refers to the new factors that
appear in the Salaried Plan’ s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent” ef fective for annuity starting dates (as
defined under the Salaried Plan) on or after January 1, 2019.

Plan shall apply (disregarding transition factors). These factors are subject to change in accordance with
paragraph (1) above.

Salaried Plan. In this respect, the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors shall be ef fective hereunder for Annuity
Starting Dates (as defined under this Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. These factors are subject to

calendar year (however , from the April 1, 2008 ef fective date through February 25, 2010, Band IV and
above applied in lieu of Leadership Group 6 and above); provided that if this would result in counting
more than 200 individuals as Key Employees as of any such determination date, then the number
treated as Key Employees will be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees
otherwise added by this paragraph (3) in order by their base compensation, from the lowest to the
highest.
(4)    Identification of Key Employees Between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010 . For
the period between February 26, 2010 and March 31 2010, Key Employees shall be identified by
combining the lists of Key Employees of all members of the PepsiCo Organization as in ef fect

determined that such treatment would be administratively less burdensome.”

employee shall be a Key Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if he was classified as at
least a Band IV or its equivalent on December 31, 2009. For this purpose, an employee shall be

one of the following types of employees in the PepsiCo Organization on that date: (i) a Band IV
employee or above in a PepsiCo Business, (ii) a Level E7 employee or above in a PBG Business,

successor , by applying as of such December
- 13 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
31 the default rules that apply under such regulation for determining the minimum number of a
service recipient’ s specified employees. If the preceding sentence and the methods for identifying
Key Employees set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, taken together , would result in more than
200 individuals being counted as Key Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then
the number of individuals treated as Key Employees pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are
not described in the first sentence of this subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating
from consideration those employees otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base
compensation, from the lowest base compensation to the highest.
(iv)    For purposes of this paragraph (5), “P AS Business” means each employer ,
division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company
classifies as part of the P AS business; “PBG Business” means each employer , division of an
employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of

The method for identifying Key Employees set forth in this definition is intended as an alternative method of

licensing such product anywhere in the world – beverages, including without limitation carbonated soft drinks,
tea, water , juice drinks, sports drinks, cof fee drinks and value-added dairy drinks; juices and juice products;

the PepsiCo Organization during the Participant’ s employment with the PepsiCo Organization.
Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity : An Annuity which is payable to the Participant for life with
50 percent of the amount of such Annuity payable after the Participant’ s death to his surviving Eligible Spouse or
Eligible Domestic Partner for life. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner (as applicable) predeceases

The amount of a Participant’ s monthly payment under a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity shall be reduced to
the extent provided in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, as applicable.
Retirement : Separation from Service for reasons other than death after a Participant has fulfilled
the requirements for either a Normal, Early , Late, or Disability Retirement Pension under Article IV .
Retirement Date : The date immediately following the Participant’ s Retirement.
Retirement Pension : The Pension payable to a Participant upon Retirement under the Plan. The
term “409A Retirement Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a Retirement Pension that is derived
from the 409A Program. The term “Pre-409A Retirement Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a
Retirement Pension that is derived from the Pre-409A Program.
Salaried Plan : The program of pension benefits set forth in Part B of the PSERP Component of
both the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (“PERP-A”) and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I
(“PERP-I”), as it may be amended from time to
- 22 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
time, and as it was set forth prior to January 1, 2017 in predecessor plans to PERP-A and PERP-I.
Section 409A : Section 409A of the Code.
Separation from Service : A Participant’ s separation from service with the PepsiCo Organization,
within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). The term may also be used as a verb ( i.e., “Separates from
Service”) with no change in meaning. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participant’ s transfer to an
entity owned 20% or more by the Company will not constitute a Separation of Service to the extent permitted by
Section 409A. A Participant’ s “Final Separation from Service” is the date of his Separation from Service that
most recently precedes his Annuity Starting Date; provided, however , that to the extent a Participant is
reemployed after an Annuity Starting Date, he will have a new Final Separation from Service with respect to any
benefits to which he becomes entitled as a result of his reemployment. The following principles shall generally
apply in determining when a Separation from Service occurs:
(1)    A Participant separates from service with the Company if the Employee dies, retires,
or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company . Whether a termination of employment
has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstance indicate that the Company and
the Employee reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a certain date or
that the level of bona fide services the Employee would perform after such date (as an employee or
independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of
bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding
- 23 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
36-month period (or the full period in which the Employee provided services to the Company if the
Employee has been providing services for less than 36 months).
(2)    An Employee will not be deemed to have experienced a Separation from Service if
such Employee is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence, to the extent such
leave does not exceed a period of six months or , if longer , such longer period of time during which a right
to re-employment is protected by either statute or contract. If the period of leave exceeds six months and
the individual does not retain a right to re-employment under an applicable statute or by contract, the
employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six-month
period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any medically determinable
physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a
continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the Employee to be
unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of
employment, a 29-month period of absence may be substituted for such six-month period.
(3)    If an Employee provides services both an as employee and as a member of the Board
of Directors of the Company , the services provided as a Director are generally not taken into account in
determining whether the Employee has Separated from Service as an Employee for purposes of the
Plan, in accordance with final regulations under Section 409A.

Equivalent of the Participant’ s 409A Pension as of the Participant’ s Early Retirement Date, in the case of a
Participant who is entitled to an immediate Early 409A Retirement Pension.
Social Security Act : The Social Security Act of the United States, as amended, an enactment
providing governmental benefits in connection with events such as old age, death and disability . Any reference

extent the Plan Administrator judges the computation of those benefits to be administratively feasible.
Taxable W age Base : The contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount
shall be reduced to the actuarial equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement
Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b) reductions for any
Pre  Retirement Spouse’ s coverage and Section 4.12(b) reductions for any Pre-Retirement
Domestic Partner ’s coverage shall apply .
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form
that provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life
of the surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Eligible Domestic Partner , that is greater than

section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s
behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the foregoing
provisions of this section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form
that provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible

under this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a
lump sum shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under
this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and
any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
For purposes of this paragraph (2), actuarial equivalence shall be determined taking into account the PEP
Guarantee’ s purpose to preserve substantially the value of a benefit under the pre-1989 terms of the Plan
and the 409A Plan’ s design that of fers alternative annuities that are considered actuarial equivalent for
purposes of Section 409A (taking into account, without limitation, the special rule for subsidized joint and

Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the Participant’ s Total Pension under Section 5.1(c)(1) above only
to the extent the application of such rule to the Participant’ s 409A Pension will not result in a change in the time

payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying plan and
compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the maximum extent
possible; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into ef fect in a particular
situation, the limit on of fsets in the prior sentence will not apply .

in the cost of living. Inflation protection that is in ef fect shall carry over to any survivor benefit payable on behalf

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
if it is: (i) postmarked that day , or (ii) actually received by the Plan Administrator on that day . Receipt under (ii) must
occur by the close of business on the date in question, which time is to be determined by the Plan Administrator .
Spousal consent is not required for an election to be valid.
(a)    Election of an Optional Form of Payment : To be valid, an election of an optional form of
Annuity under Section 6.2, for (i) a Participant’ s 409A Retirement Pension (if a proper election was made under
paragraph 6.1(a)(2)) or (ii) a Participant’ s 409A V ested T erminated Pension, must be in writing, signed by the
Participant, and received by the Plan Administrator at least one day prior to the Annuity Starting Date that
applies to the Participant’ s Pension in accordance with Section 6.1. In addition, an election under this subsection
must specify one of the optional forms of payment available under Section 6.2 and a beneficiary , if applicable, in
accordance with Section 6.5 below . To the extent permitted by the Plan Administrator , an election made through
electronic media shall be considered to satisfy the requirement for a written election, and an electronic
affirmation of such an election shall be considered to satisfy the requirement for a signed election.
(b)    Multiple Annuity Starting Dates : When amounts become payable to a Participant in
accordance with Article IV , they shall be payable as of the Participant’ s Annuity Starting Date and the election
procedures (in this section and Sections 6.1 and 6.5) shall apply to all of the Participant’ s unpaid accruals as of
such Annuity Starting Date, with the following exception. In the case of a Participant who is rehired after his
initial Annuity Starting Date and who (i) is currently receiving an Annuity that remained in pay status upon rehire,
or (ii) was previously paid a lump sum distribution (other than
- 66 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
a cashout distribution described in Section 4.9(a)), the Participant’ s subsequent Annuity Starting Date (as a
result of his subsequent Separation from Service), and the election procedures at such subsequent Annuity
Starting Date, shall apply only to the portion of his benefit that accrues after his rehire. Any prior accruals that
remain to be paid as of the Participant’ s subsequent Annuity Starting Date shall continue to be payable in
accordance with the elections made at his initial Annuity Starting Date.
(c)    Determination of Marital Status . Effective January 1, 2014, in any case in which the form of
payment of a Participant’ s 409A Pension is determined by his marital status on his Annuity Starting Date, the
Plan Administrator shall assume the Participant is unmarried on his Annuity Starting Date unless the Participant
provides notice to the Plan prior to his Annuity Starting Date, which is deemed suf ficient and satisfactory by the
Plan Administrator , that he is married. The Participant shall give such notification to the Plan Administrator when
he makes the election described in subsection (a) above or in accordance with such other procedures that are
established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose (if any). Notwithstanding the two prior sentences, the Plan
Administrator may adopt rules that provide for a dif ferent outcome than specified above.
6.4    Special Rules for Survivor Options : The following special rules shall apply for the survivor options
available under Section 6.2.
(a)    Effect of Certain Deaths : If a Participant makes an election under Section 6.3(a) to receive his
409A Retirement Pension in the form of an optional Annuity that includes a benefit for a surviving beneficiary
under Section 6.2 and the Participant
- 67 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of the optional form of payment in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv)) dies prior to
the Annuity Starting Date of such Annuity , the election shall be disregarded. If the Participant dies after this
Annuity Starting Date but before his 409A Retirement Pension actually commences, the election shall be given
effect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse, Eligible Domestic Partner or other beneficiary (as
applicable) shall commence on the first day of the month following his death (any back payments due the
Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the case of a Participant who has elected the form of payment
described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if such Participant: (i) dies after his Annuity Starting Date, (ii) without a
surviving primary or contingent beneficiary , and (iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of payment,
then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’ s estate. If
payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant’ s primary or contingent beneficiary and
such beneficiary dies before payments are completed, then the remaining payments due under such form of
payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’ s estate.
(b)    Beneficiary Who Is Not an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner : If a Participant’ s
beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , he may not elect:
(1)    The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his beneficiary is
more than 10 years younger than he is, or
(2)    The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(ii) if his beneficiary is
more than 19 years younger than he is.
- 68 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
6.5    Designation of Beneficiary : A Participant who has elected under Section 6.2 to receive all or part of
his Retirement Pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be
entitled to any amounts payable on his death. Such designation shall be made on the election form used to choose
such optional form of payment or an approved election form filed under the Salaried Plan, whichever is applicable. In
the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), the Participant shall be entitled to name both a
primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary . A Participant (whether active or former) shall have the right to change
or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to his Annuity Starting Date. The designation of any beneficiary ,
and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator . A
beneficiary designation shall not be ef fective unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator . If no beneficiary is
properly designated and a Participant’ s elects a survivor ’s option described in Section 6.2(a)(2), the Participant’ s
beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as applicable. A Participant entitled to a V ested
Pension does not have the right or ability to name a beneficiary; if the Participant is permitted under Section 6.2 to elect
an optional form of payment, then his beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner , as
applicable, on his Annuity Starting Date.
6.6    Required Delay for Key Employees : Notwithstanding Section 6.1 above, if a Participant is classified
as a Key Employee upon his Separation from Service (or at such other time for determining Key Employee status as

- 69 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(a)    Distribution of a Retirement Pension : In the case of a Key Employee Participant who is
entitled to a 409A Retirement Pension, distributions shall commence on the earliest first of the month that is at
least six months after the date the Participant Separates from Service (or , if earlier , the Participant’ s death). For
periods before 2009, commencement of distributions, however , shall not be delayed under the preceding
sentence if the Participant’ s 409A Retirement Pension commences at the same time as his pension under the
Salaried Plan in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(3)(i).
(b)    Distribution of a V ested Pension . In the case of a Participant who is entitled to a 409A V ested
Pension, distributions shall commence as provided in Section 6.1(b), or if later , on the earliest first of the month
that is at least six months after the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or , if earlier , the Participant’ s death).
For periods before 2009, commencement of distributions, however , shall not be delayed under the preceding
sentence if the Participant’ s 409A V ested Pension commences at the same time as his pension under the
Salaried Plan in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(3)(i).
(c)    Interest Paid for Delay . Any payments to the Participant that are delayed in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall be increased for earnings at the interest rate used to compute the
Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value through the date the check for payment is prepared, with such delayed
payment and accumulated interest paid as a lump sum payment to the Participant on the date payment occurs in
accordance with subsection (a) or (b) above, whichever is applicable. If a Participant’ s beneficiary or estate is
paid under subsection (a) or (b) above as a result of his death, then any payments that would have been made
to the Participant and that
- 70 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
were delayed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall be paid as otherwise provided in the
Plan, with interest at the rate specified in the preceding sentence through the date the check for payment is
prepared.
6.7    Payment of FICA and Related Income T axes : As provided in subsections (a) through (c) below , a
portion of a Participant’ s 409A Pension shall be paid as a single lump sum and remitted directly to the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) in satisfaction of the Participant’ s FICA Amount and the related withholding of income tax at source on
wages (imposed under Code Section 3401 or the corresponding withholding provisions of the applicable state, local or
foreign tax laws as a result of the payment of the FICA Amount) and the additional withholding of income tax at source
on wages that is attributable to the pyramiding of wages and taxes.
(a)    Timing of Payment:  As of the date that the Participant’ s FICA Amount and related income tax
withholding are due to be deposited with the IRS, a lump sum payment equal to the Participant’ s FICA Amount
and any related income tax withholding shall be paid from the Participant’ s 409A Pension and remitted to the
IRS (or other applicable tax authority) in satisfaction of such FICA Amount and income tax withholding related to
such FICA Amount. The classification of a Participant as a Key Employee (as defined in Section 2.1) shall have
no ef fect on the timing of the lump sum payment under this subsection (a).
(b)    Reduction of 409A Pension . To reflect the payment of a Participant’ s FICA Amount and any
related income tax liability , the Participant’ s 409A Pension shall be reduced, ef fective as of the date for payment
of the lump sum in
- 71 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
accordance with subsection (a) above, with such reduction being the Actuarial Equivalent of the lump sum
payment used to satisfy the Participant’ s FICA Amount and related income tax withholding. It is expressly
contemplated that this reduction may occur ef fective as of a date that is after the date payment of a Participant’ s
409A Pension commences.
(A)    No Ef fect on Commencement of 409A Pension . The Participant’ s 409A Pension shall
commence in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The lump sum payment to satisfy the Participant’ s
FICA Amount and related income tax withholding shall not af fect the time of payment of the Participant’ s
actuarially reduced 409A Pension, including not af fecting any required delay in payment to a Participant
who is classified as a Key Employee.

ARTICLE VII  
Administration     
7.1    Authority to Administer Plan : The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator , which shall have
the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator shall
maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the Participant in
writing, including the Participant’ s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan Administrator ’s
interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons and parties
concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any restrictions that
might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including with respect to
the Company or the Plan Administrator .
7.2    Facility of Payment : Whenever , in the Plan Administrator ’s opinion, a person entitled to receive any
payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to
be unable to manage his financial af fairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the legal
representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of such
person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the
provisions of the Plan.
- 73 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
7.3    Claims Procedure : The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to
construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such
benefits, and its decisions on such matters are final and conclusive. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid
only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them. This
discretionary authority is intended to be absolute, and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question, the
Plan Administrator is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible. Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall
be reviewed by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard ( i.e., the abuse of
discretion standard). If, pursuant to this discretionary authority , an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a
Participant or beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator , or a party designated by the
Plan Administrator , will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan
Administrator , a comprehensible written notice setting forth:
(a)    The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
(b)    Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c)    A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to
perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
(d)    A description of the Plan’ s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such
process and a statement of the claimant’ s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further denial on
review).
- 74 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim it
may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant
before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by
which the Plan Committee expects to make the final decision. The claim review procedure is available upon written
request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator , or the designated party , within 60 days after receipt by the claimant of
written notice of the denial of the claim. Upon review , the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair
review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, document, records and
other information relevant to the claim and the Plan Administrator ’s review shall take into account such comments,
documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination.
The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review , unless circumstances
warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished
to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension
and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. The final decision shall be in writing
and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific reasons for the decision with
references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the claimant is entitled to
receive, upon request ad free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other
information relevant to his or her claim for benefits.
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed
solely on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the
- 75 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’ s having fully
exhausted all rights under this section as is more fully explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is
required to be sent to a claimant under this section may be sent pursuant to any method approved under Department of
Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other applicable guidance.
7.4    Effect of Specific References : Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator ’s discretion
shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator ’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other
provision, is less complete or broad.
7.5    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’ s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court:  Before filing any Claim
(including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the Claimant’ s
rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.
(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is
intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary
to clarify or ef fect this intent may be taken).
(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion of
the Plan’ s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be
limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims
procedure.
(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other
Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court
- 76 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
might consider at the same time) are of greater significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator
may choose to provide in connection with novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the
rights are actual or potential and (iv) even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established
specific claims procedures that directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case
the Plan Administrator (upon notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall
apply (or act by analogy to) the claims procedures of Section 7.5 that apply to claims for benefits).
(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class basis
or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be made as
are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply .
(i)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, action or other matter .
(ii)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of
the following –
(A)    The interpretation of the Plan
(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan
(C)    The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of
applicable law;

conditions or requirements of the Plan;
(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;
(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary duty;
or
(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan
Administrator , or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way .

Beneficiary (or the spouse, former spouse, domestic partner , estate, heir or representative of any
of the foregoing individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a relationship to any of the
foregoing individuals or the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of the foregoing, who has a
Claim.
- 78 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
7.6    Limitations on Actions : Effective for claims and actions filed on or after January 1, 201 1, any claim
filed under Article VII and any action filed in state or federal court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee,
Participant, beneficiary or any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful
denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought within
two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action
with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when
the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action (ii) the date
identified to the Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which payments shall commence, or (iii) when the Petitioner
has actual or constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. For purposes of this subsection, a
cause of action with respect to the alleged interference with ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when
the claimant has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts that are alleged to interfere with ERISA-protected rights.
Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any
representative of the Petitioner , from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications
following the mandatory appeals process described in Section 7.3 shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.
7.7    Restriction on V enue : Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the

ARTICLE VIII  
Miscellaneous     
8.1    Nonguarantee of Employment : Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of
employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued in the
employment of an Employer , or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or
without cause.
8.2    Nonalienation of Benefits : Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits
under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer , assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary , and any attempt to
anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer , assign, pledge, encumber , charge or otherwise dispose of any right to benefits
payable hereunder , including any assignment or alienation in connection with a divorce, separation, child support or
similar arrangement, shall be null and void and not binding on the Company . The Company shall not in any manner be
liable for , or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits
hereunder .
8.3    Unfunded Plan : The Company’ s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute
liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company’ s general funds. To the extent the Participant or any
other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any
unsecured general creditor of the Company .
- 80 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
8.4    Action by the Company : Any action by the Company under this Plan may be made by the Board of
Directors of the Company or by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, with a report of any actions
taken by it to the Board of Directors. In addition, such action may be made by any other person or persons duly

8.6    Compliance with Section 409A :
(a)    General : It is the intention of the Company that the Plan shall be construed in accordance
with the applicable requirements of Section 409A. Further , in the event that the Plan shall be deemed not to
comply with Section 409A, then neither the Company , the Board of Directors, the Plan Administrator nor its or
their designees or agents shall be liable to any Participant or other person for actions, decisions or
determinations made in good faith.
(b)    Non-duplication of benefits : In the interest of clarity , and to determine benefits in compliance
with the requirements of Section 409A, provisions have been included in this 409A Document describing the
calculation of benefits under certain specific circumstances, for example, provisions relating to the inclusion of
salary continuation during certain window severance programs in the calculation of Highest A verage Monthly
Earnings, as specified in Appendix B. Notwithstanding this or any
- 81 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
similar provision, no duplication of benefits may at any time occur under the Plan. Therefore, to the extent that a
specific provision of the Plan provides for recognizing a benefit determining element (such as pensionable
earnings or service) and this same element is or could be recognized in some other way under the Plan, the
specific provision of the Plan shall govern and there shall be absolutely no duplicate recognition of such element
under any other provision of the Plan, or pursuant to the Plan’ s integration with the Salaried Plan. This provision
shall govern over any contrary provision of the Plan that might be interpreted to support duplication of benefits.
8.7    Section 457A : To avoid the application of Code section 457A (“Section 457A”) to a Participant’ s
Pension, the following shall apply to a Participant who transfers to a work location outside of the United States to

- 82 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

(c) below at that time; and
(c)    The Participant shall have no legal right to (and the Participant shall not receive) any Benefit

connection with a severed employee’ s Special Early Retirement (as defined in Appendix Article D) under a temporary
severance program sponsored by the Company , this portion of the Plan shall be a component of the Company’ s
unfunded severance plan that includes the temporary program of severance benefits in question. As a component of a

C.2    International T ransfer Participants :
An “International T ransfer Participant” is a Participant who is:
(a)    General Rule : An individual who, following a transfer to an April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary (as defined
in paragraph (5) of the Employer definition in Section 2.1 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, as in ef fect on January
1, 2014)), would qualify as an Employee within the meaning of paragraph (2)(vi) of the Employee definition in

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
C.3    Benefit Formula for International T ransfer Participants :

Plan.
(a)    Total Pension for International T ransfer Participant : Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an
International T ransfer Participant’ s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be
calculated as if he continued to receive Credited Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan while working for
the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary to which he transferred following his employment with an Employer based in
the United States, without regard to the actual date on which he ceased receiving Credited Service and Earnings
under the Salaried Plan. However , the T otal Pension of an International T ransfer Participant whose transfer to an
April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary occurred prior to 1992 shall not take into account Credited Service and Earnings
for employment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary prior to 1992.
(b)    Calculation of International T ransfer Participant’ s Benefit : The International T ransfer Participant’ s
benefit under the Plan shall be calculated by reducing his T otal Pension as determined under subsection (a)

(a)    Total Pension for PIRP T ransfer Participant : Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a PIRP
Transfer Participant’ s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be calculated as provided
in paragraphs (1) and (2) below .
(1)    First, a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Total Pension shall be calculated as if he were an eligible
employee under the Salaried Plan for the entire Y ear of T ransfer , and as if he received Credited Service
and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Y ear of T ransfer equal to – (i) his actual Credited Service
and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Y ear of T ransfer , increased by  (ii) any other compensation
and service for the Y ear of T ransfer that would have been recognized as PIRP-DB Salary and PIRP DB
Pensionable Service, if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not apply for the Y ear of T ransfer .
(2)    If (during a year a PIRP T ransfer Participant is otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan)
the PIRP T ransfer Participant would be credited with PIRP-DB Salary that cannot be recognized under
PIRP as a result of Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB, and if this PIRP-DB Salary would be considered for accrual
purposes
- 115 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
under PIRP-DB in connection with PIRP-DB Pensionable Service that is not recognized under this Plan,
the increase in the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Accrued Benefit under PIRP that is related to this PIRP-DB
Pensionable Service and that is blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB shall be added to the PIRP T ransfer
Participant’ s Accrued Benefit under this Plan. In the case of a PIRP T ransfer Participant who has a
Separation from Service on or after January 1, 2017, this increase in the PIRP T ransfers Participant’ s
Accrued Benefit under this Plan shall result in an appropriate increase, determined in the Company’ s
discretion, in the T otal Pension determined under paragraph (1) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
determining Credited Service and Earnings under this subsection (a), no compensation or service shall be
taken into account more than once, and a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Total Pension shall be determined
in a way that avoids any duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP T ransfer
Participant under PIRP-DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or
contributed to by the Company or an af filiate, but without applying any of fset that would violate Code
Section 409A.
(b)    Calculation of PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s Benefit : The PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under the
Plan shall be calculated by reducing his T otal Pension as determined under subsection (a) above by the
reductions that are normally applicable under Article V . In addition, in the case of a PIRP T ransfer Participant
who has a Separation from Service on or after January 1, 2017, if (during a year a PIRP T ransfer Participant is
otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan) the value of the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s benefit under PIRP-DB
would increase (if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not
- 116 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
apply) as a result of the PIRP T ransfer Participant becoming eligible for early retirement under PIRP-DB, then
the projected increase in value of the PIRP-DB benefit at the PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s retirement under PIRP-
DB, which will be blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP , shall result in an appropriate increase, determined in the
Company’ s discretion, in the Participant’ s benefit under this Plan that is payable at the time and in the form
applicable under this Plan. The appropriate increase shall be determined net of any expected increase in the
value of the benefit under this Plan related to becoming eligible for Early Retirement under this Plan. In addition,
a PIRP T ransfer Participant’ s appropriate increase shall be determined in a way that avoids any duplication of
benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP T ransfer Participant under PIRP-DB (after applying
Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the Company or an af filiate, but
without applying any of fset that would violate Code Section 409A.
C.6    Alternative Arrangements Permitted :
Notwithstanding any provision of this Article or the Plan to the contrary , the Company and a Participant who
would qualify as an International T ransfer Participant under Section C.2 above may agree in writing to disregard the
provisions of this Article in favor of another mutually agreed upon benefit arrangement under the Plan that complies
with Code Section 409A, in which case this Article shall not apply .

that such individual is reemployed by the Company on or after May 1, 2009, into a position that is classified as Band 4
(or its equivalent) or higher . For purposes of determining such Participant’ s Total Pension within the meaning of Section
5.1(c)(1), but not for purposes of determining such Participant’ s Salaried Plan Pension within the meaning of Section
5.1(c)(2), such Participant’ s position on reemployment will be deemed to be classified as below Band 4 (or its
equivalent), so that the Participant’ s transfer is eligible to be treated as an Eligible T ransfer (subject to the other
conditions thereof) and the Participant is eligible for the imputed service provisions of Section TRI.4(b) and (c). Such
Participant’ s benefit otherwise shall be subject to the Plan’ s usual conditions and shall be paid in accordance with the
Plan’ s usual terms. All benefits paid under this Article are subject to Code section 409A.

F.2    “Covered U.K. Employee” Defined :
A “Covered U.K. Employee” is a participant in the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (“U.K. Participant”) who – (i)
becomes subject to United States income taxes, e.g., by transferring to a position with the Company in the United
States or otherwise (hereinafter referenced as “Engages in U.S. Service”), (ii) continues to accrue benefits under the
PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan after he Engages in U.S. Service, (iii) would have also accrued a benefit under the U.K.
Supplementary Pension Appendix for such period following when he Engages in U.S. Service (except for the
unavailability of accruals under such Appendix for the period a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service), (iv)
subsequently either – (A) is localized in the United States as an employee of the PepsiCo Organization, or (B)
terminates employment with the PepsiCo Organization (provided this occurs before the date the U.K. Participant
commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States, as defined
- 125 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
in the Code), and (v) only after fully satisfying all of the preceding clauses, is then designated by the Company (in its
completely unfettered discretion) as a Covered U.K. Employee and thereby granted a legally binding right to a benefit
under this Article F at the time of the designation. The period that a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service shall
begin on the first day that he becomes subject to United States income taxes (his “U.S. Commencement Date”), and it
shall end on the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes or , if earlier , the date his Plan benefits under this
Article F commence (his “U.S. Cessation Date”).
F.3    Benefit for Covered U.K. Employees :
A Covered U.K. Employee’ s benefit under the Plan shall be determined by calculating, as of his Modified U.S.
Cessation Date, his “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” and then subtracting from this amount his “Frozen U.K.
Supplementary Benefit.” For this purpose, a Covered U.K. Employee’ s—
(a)    “Modified U.S. Cessation Date” is the earliest of the following – (i) the date he is no longer subject to
U.S. income taxes, (ii) the date he first satisfies clause (iv) of Section F .2, (iii) the date he commences an
assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States (as defined in the Code), or
(iv) the date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence.
(b)    “T otal U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he would have under the terms of
the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix, calculated based on all service and compensation with the
Company through his Modified U.S. Cessation Date that is counted in the calculation of his benefit under the
PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (or that would be counted but for a limitation applicable to the plan under
- 126 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
U.K. law), and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date
his benefits under this Article F commence, and
(c)    “Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he had under the terms of the
U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date, and with such
total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his benefits under this
Article F commence.
The calculation provided for in the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the operating rules set forth in
Section F .4 below .
F.4    Operating Rules:
The following operating rules apply to the calculation in Section F .3. above.
(a)    In general, accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K.
Employee’ s U.S. Cessation Date shall not reduce the benefit under this Article F determined under Section F .3.
Notwithstanding the prior sentence and anything in Section F .3 to the contrary , to the extent a Covered U.K.
Employee’ s accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K. Employee’ s U.S.
Cessation Date have more than fully of fset the Covered U.K. Employee’ s accruals under the U.K.
Supplementary Pension Appendix (and the excess would have been of fset against the benefit under this Article
F had such benefit accrued under the U.K. Supplementary Appendix), then any such excess as of the date
benefits under this Article F commence (expressed as a lump sum as of such date) shall be of fset against the
benefits under this Article F to the extent such of fset would not violate Code Section 409A.
- 127 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(b)    In determining the value of a lump sum under this Article F , the actuarial assumptions that are used
shall be actuarial assumptions that comply with Section 417(e) of the Code and, specifically , are the Code
Section 417(e) assumptions that would be used under the PepsiCo Salaried Employees Retirement Plan to pay
a retirement lump sum as of the date applicable that the lump sum in question is to be determined under this
Article F .
(c)    A Covered U.K. Employee’ s Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit shall be determined on the basis of
assuming that the Covered U.K. employee voluntarily terminated employment and any other service relationship
with the PepsiCo Organization as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date.
(d)    This subsection applies if the terms of the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan or the U.K. Supplementary
Pension Appendix are amended during a year in a way that would change the results under the Section F .3
calculation, and such amendment otherwise applies earlier than the immediately following year . In this case, to
the extent that doing is necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the calculation in Section F .3 shall be
made by delaying the application of the amendment so that it is prospectively ef fective starting with the
immediately following year .
(e)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached
his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then again Engages in U.S. Service and meets all of the requirements to be a
Covered U.K. Employee when he again Engages in U.S. Service, the foregoing terms shall be applied again to
determine if he earns a benefit for the new period that he Engages in U.S. Service, except that any resulting
benefit from this new period shall be reduced by the lump sum value of any
- 128 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).
(f)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F , (ii) has reached
his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then is employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification that would be
eligible for an accrual under the provisions of the Plan other than this Article F (the “Other Provisions”), then the
Other Provisions shall be applied to determine if he earns a benefit under the Other Provisions for the new
period of service, except that any resulting benefit from this new period of service shall be reduced by the lump
sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).
F.5    No Other Benefits :
A Covered U.K. Employee shall not be entitled to any other benefits under this Plan or the Salaried Plan while
he is a Covered U.K. Employee (or while he would be a Covered U.K. Employee if clauses (iv) and (v) of Section F .2.
were not included in the definition of Covered U.K. Employee). In addition, prior to the time that an individual has
satisfied all of the requirements to be considered a Covered U.K. Employee, the individual has no legally binding right
to a benefit under this Article F . Accordingly , for the avoidance of doubt, at any point before such time, the Company
may take action that prevents the individual from becoming entitled to a benefit under this Article F ( e.g., by deciding
that it will not designate the individual as a Covered U.K. Employee, in an unfettered exercise of the Company’ s
discretion), regardless of the services performed or other actions taken by the individual through this point in time, and
regardless of any other factor .

APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG
Effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 201 1, the PBG PEP is hereby merged with and into the PepsiCo
PEP, with the PepsiCo PEP as the surviving plan after the merger . The following Appendix Article PBG governs PBG
PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the merger , except as follows: Articles VII
(Administration), VIII (Miscellaneous), IX (Amendment and T ermination), X (ERISA Plan Structure) and XI (Applicable
Law) of the main section of this document shall govern PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP
Document. There shall be no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to Code section 409A
under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Document as a result of the plan merger or the revisions made to the 409A
PBG PEP Document when it was incorporated into this Appendix.
ARTICLE I T O APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - HIST ORY AND PURPOSE
1.1    History of Plan . The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (“PBG”) established the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP”
or “Plan”) ef fective April 6, 1999 for the benefit of salaried employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the
PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). The Plan was initially established as a successor plan to
the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, due to PBG’ s April 6, 1999 initial public of fering, and the Plan included
historical PepsiCo provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under the Plan. The Plan
provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, the Plan provides benefits for certain eligible employees
based on the pre-1989
- 135 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Salaried Plan formula. Effective April 1, 2009, the Plan also provides benefits for employees whose eligible pay under
the Salaried Plan is reduced due to the employees’ elective deferrals under the PBG Executive Income Deferral
Program and for certain executives who would be “Grandfathered Participants” under the Salaried Plan but for their
classification as salary band E3-E8 or MP (or its equivalent, for periods on and after the Ef fective T ime). The Plan is
intended as a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Plan is structured as two plans. The portion of the
Plan that provides benefits based on limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) is
intended to be an “excess benefit plan” as described in Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA. The remainder of the Plan is intended
to be a plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits to a select group of
management or highly-compensated employees.
The Plan has been amended from time to time, most recently in the form of an amendment and complete restatement
effective as of April 1, 2009 (“2009 Restatement”). PBG further amended the Plan as a result of the merger of PBG with
and into Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company , Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”),
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 3, 2009 among PBG, the Company and Pepsi-Cola
Metropolitan Company , Inc., and to facilitate the Company’ s assumption of PBG’ s role as the Plan’ s sponsor .
1.2    Effect of Amendment and Restatement . The Plan as in ef fect on October 3, 2004 is referred to herein as the
Prior Plan.
Except as otherwise explicitly provided in Section 6.1(b)(3) of this Plan, a Participant’ s benefit (including death
benefits), determined under the terms of the Plan as in ef fect on October 3,
- 136 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
2004 as if the Participant had terminated employment on December 31, 2004, without regard to any compensation paid
or services rendered after 2004, or any other events af fecting the amount of or the entitlement to benefits (other than
the Participant’ s survival or the Participant’ s election under the terms of the Plan with respect to the time or form of
benefit) (the “Grandfathered Benefit”) shall be paid at the time and in the form provided by the terms of the Plan as in
effect on October 3, 2004.
The benefit of a Participant accrued under this Plan based on all compensation and services taken into account by the
Prior Plan and this Plan, less the Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be paid in the times and in the form as
provided in this Plan. Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Plan, this Plan superseded the Prior Plan ef fective
January 1, 2009, with respect to amounts accrued and vested after 2004 by Participants who had not commenced
receiving benefits as of January 1, 2009. The Plan was administered in accordance with a good faith interpretation of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder from January 1, 2005
through December 31, 2008. Amounts accrued under this Plan after 2004 shall be treated as payable under a separate
Plan for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

Treas. Reg. §§ 1.409A-1(i)(5) and -1(i)(8) and Section VII.C.4.d of the Preamble to the Final Regulations
under Section 409A of the Code, which permits “service recipients to simply combine the pre-transaction
separate lists of specified employees where it is determined that such treatment would be administratively
less burdensome.”
(5)     Identification of Specified Employees on and After April 1, 2010 . Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for the periods on after April 1, 2010, Key Employees shall be identified as follows:
(i)     For the period that begins on April 1, 2010, and ends on March 31, 201 1, an employee
shall be a Specified Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if he was classified as at least
a Band IV or its equivalent on December 31, 2009. For this purpose, an employee shall be
considered to be at least a Band IV or its equivalent as of a date if the employee is classified as

(iii)    Notwithstanding the rule of administrative convenience in paragraph (3) above, an
employee shall be a Specified Employee for the 12-month period that begins on any April 1, if as of the preceding
December 31 the employee would be a specified employee, within the meaning of T reasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i), or
any successor , by applying as of such December 31 the default rules that apply under such regulation for determining
the minimum number of a service recipient’ s specified employees. If the preceding sentence and the methods for
identifying Specified Employees set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, taken together , would result in more than 200
individuals being counted as Specified Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the number of
individuals treated as Specified Employees pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first
sentence of this subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees
otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the lowest base compensation to the

ARTICLE IV T O APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - AMOUNT OF RETIREMENT PENSION
4.1    PEP Pension . Subject to Sections 4.5 and 8.7, a Participant’ s PEP Pension shall equal the amount
determined under (a) or (b) of this Section 4.1, whichever is applicable. Such amount shall be determined as of the
date of the Participant’ s Separation from Service.
(a)    Same Form as Salaried Plan . If a Participant’ s PEP Pension will be paid in the same form and will
commence as of the same time as his pension under the Salaried Plan, then his monthly PEP Pension shall be
equal to the excess of:
(1)    The greater of:
(i)    the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such Participant under
the Salaried Plan without regard to (I) the Compensation Limitation; (II) the Section 415 Limitation;
(III) the exclusion from Earnings of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant under the
EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 201 1; and (IV) the April 1, 2009 through
December 31, 2010 exclusion from the Salaried Plan definition of a Grandfathered Participant of a
Participant who, as of March 31, 2009, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and had
attained age 50 and completed five years of Service or whose sum of his age and years of Service
was at least 65; and
(ii)    if applicable, the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.2, expressed in such
form and payable as of such time; over
(2)    The amount of the monthly pension benefit that is in fact payable to such Salaried Plan
Participant under the Salaried Plan, expressed in such form and payable as of such time.
- 147 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.
(b)    Different Form than Salaried Plan . If a Participant’ s PEP Pension will be paid in a dif ferent form
(whether in whole or in part) or will commence as of a dif ferent time than his pension benefit under the Salaried
Plan, his PEP Pension shall be the product of:
(1)    The greater of:
(i)    the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such Participant under
the Salaried Plan without regard to (I) the Compensation Limitation; (II) the Section 415 Limitation;
(III) the exclusion from Earnings of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant under the
EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 201 1; and (IV) the March 31, 2009 through
December 31, 2010 exclusion from the Salaried Plan definition of a Grandfathered Participant of a
Participant who, as of such date, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and had attained age
50 and completed five years of Service or whose sum of his age and years of Service was at least
65; and
(ii)    if applicable, the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.2, expressed in the
form and payable as of such time as applies to his PEP Pension under this Plan, multiplied by
- 148 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(2)    A fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)(1),
reduced by the value of his pension under the Salaried Plan, and the denominator of which is the value of
the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)(1) (with value determined on a reasonable and consistent basis,
in the discretion of the Plan Administrator , with respect to similarly situated employees).
The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the
Participant’ s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event any portion of the accrued benefit of a Participant under this Plan
or the Salaried Plan is awarded to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order , as such
terms are defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, the Participant’ s total PEP Pension shall be adjusted, as the
Plan Administrator shall determine, so that the combined benefit payable to the Participant and the alternate
payee from this Plan and the Salaried Plan is the amount determined pursuant to subsections 4.1(a) and (b)
above, as applicable.
4.2    PEP Guarantee . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be
entitled to a PEP Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below , if any .
(a)    Eligibility . A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988 pensionable
earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable earnings”
means the Participant’ s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year that was recognized for benefit accrual
received under the Salaried
- 149 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Plan as in ef fect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity attributable
to any period when that entity was not an Employer .
(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee shall be determined under
paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
(1)    Formula . The amount of a Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this paragraph shall be
determined as follows:
(i)    Three percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for the first 10
years of Credited Service, plus
(ii)    One percent of the Participant’ s Highest A verage Monthly Earnings for each year of
Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less
(iii)    One and two-thirds percent of the Participant’ s Primary Social Security Amount
multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
In determining the amount of a V ested Pension, the PEP Guarantee shall first be calculated on the
basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he continued to accrue Credited
Service until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest A verage Monthly Earnings and Primary
Social Security Amount at the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the date such Participant
ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan, and then shall be
reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant’ s
actual years of Credited Service on the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the date such
Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and
- 150 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
this Plan and the denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he would have earned had he
continued to accrue Credited Service until his Normal Retirement Age.
(2)    Calculation . The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph
(1) above, subject to the following special rules:
(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s Annuity : Subject to
subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner and has commenced receipt of an Annuity under this
section, the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a
survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’ s Annuity under this section, with no
corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the first day of the month coincident
with or following the Participant’ s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to
the Eligible Spouse’ s or Eligible Domestic Partner ’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable
under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below .
(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible
Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is
- 151 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.
(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible
Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4 percent.
This subparagraph applies only to a Participant who retires on or after his Early Retirement
Date.
(ii)    Reductions . The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’ s PEP
Guarantee.
(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment amount
shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit
commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal Retirement
Date.
(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a V ested Pension, the payment amount shall be reduced
to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if payment
commences before such date), and the reductions set forth in the Salaried Plan for any
- 152 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Pre-Retirement Spouse’ s coverage or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner ’s coverage shall apply .
(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that
provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the life of the
surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner , that is greater than that provided under
subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be
reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial
Equivalent of the PEP Guarantee otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this section.
(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that
provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic
Partner . In this instance, the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so
that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of a
Single Life Annuity for the Participant’ s life.
(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in an Annuity form
that includes inflation protection described in the Salaried Plan. In this instance, the Participant’ s
PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on
the Participant’ s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity without such protection.
- 153 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion . The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for
a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall be the
Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’ s PEP Guarantee determined under this section, taking into
account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement
reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
(iv)    April 1, 2009 Salaried Plan Changes.
(A)    The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for a Participant
who, as of March 31, 2009, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and who had attained age
50 and completed five years of Service or (inclusively) whose sum of his age and years of Service
was at least 65 shall be determined as if such Participant were a Grandfathered Participant in the
Salaried Plan on April 1, 2009 (so that Earnings and Credited Service were not frozen as of March
31, 2009 for the period April 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010).
(B)    Highest A verage Monthly Earnings shall be determined without regard to the exclusion
from Earnings under the Salaried Plan of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant under
the EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 201 1.
4.3    Certain Adjustments . Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to
adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a
nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a
member of the PBG
- 154 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals (this category of similar plans includes the
PepsiCo Prior Plan).
(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants . This subsection shall apply to a current or former
Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and (i) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is
recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service, or (ii) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan
would have been recalculated, based on an additional period of Credited Service if the Participant would have
been considered a Grandfathered Participant as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan if the Participant was
not classified by the Employer as salary band E3-E8 or MP . In such event, the Participant’ s PEP Pension shall
be recalculated hereunder . For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee under Section 4.2 is adjusted for in-service
distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by
taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.
(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans . If the benefit paid under a specified plan
on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the
increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the
PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder ,
the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically
intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.
(c)    No Benefit Offsets That W ould V iolate Section 409A . If a Participant has earned a benefit under a
plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo/PBG Organization
- 155 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
that is a “qualifying plan” for purposes of the “Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan
and the “T ransfers and Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.6 of Part C of the Salaried Plan, such T ransfers and
Non-Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the amount determined under Section 4.1(a)(1) or 4.1(b)(1)
above (as applicable) only to the extent the application of such rule will not result in a change in the time or form
of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on of fsets in the
preceding sentence, it is the Company’ s intent to undertake to make special arrangements with respect to the
payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying plan, and
compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the maximum extent
possible; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into ef fect in a particular
situation, the limit on of fsets in the prior sentence will not apply .
4.4    Reemployment of Certain Participants . In the case of a current or former Participant who is reemployed
and is eligible to reparticipate in the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his non-Grandfathered
PEP Pension will not be suspended. If such Participant accrues an additional PEP Pension for service after such
reemployment, his PEP Pension on his subsequent Separation from Service shall be reduced by the present value of
PEP benefits previously distributed to such Participant, as determined by the Plan Administrator .
4.5    Vesting; Misconduct . Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant shall be fully vested in his Accrued Benefit at
the time he becomes fully vested in his accrued benefit under the Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, or any
other provision of the Plan to the contrary , a Participant shall forfeit his or her entire PEP Pension if the Plan
Administrator
- 156 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
determines that such Participant has engaged in “Misconduct” as defined below , determined without regard to whether
the Misconduct occurred before or after the Participant’ s Severance from Service. The Plan Administrator may , in its
sole discretion, require the Participant to pay to the Employer any PEP Pension paid to the Participant within the twelve
month period immediately preceding a date on which the Participant has engaged in such Misconduct, as determined
by the Plan Administrator .
“Misconduct” means any of the following, as determined by the Plan Administrator in good faith: (i) violation of
any agreement between the Company or Employer and the Participant, including but not limited to a violation relating to
the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers, licensors
or contractors, or the performance of competitive services, (ii) violation of any duty to the Company or Employer ,
including but not limited to violation of the Company’ s Code of Conduct; (iii) making, or causing or attempting to cause
any other person to make, any statement (whether written, oral or electronic), or conveying any information about the
Company or Employer which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company or Employer
unless required by law or pursuant to a Company or Employer policy; (iv) improperly disclosing or otherwise misusing
any confidential information regarding the Company or Employer; (v) unlawful trading in the securities of the Company
or of another company based on information garnered as a result of that Participant’ s employment or other relationship
with the Company; (vi) engaging in any act which is considered to be contrary to the best interests of the Company or
Employer , including but not limited to recruiting or soliciting employees of the Employer; or (vii) commission of a felony
or other serious crime or engaging in any activity which constitutes gross misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and for the avoidance of
- 157 -
PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program
doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Participant from communicating with government authorities concerning
any possible legal violations.  The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over
any information appropriately protected by the privilege.

PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Company”) established the PepsiCo Automatic Retirement Contribution Equalization Plan (the “Plan”)
for the benefit of employees of the PepsiCo Or ganization who receive Automatic Retirement Contributions under the PepsiCo
Savings Plan (the “Savings Plan”), and whose Automatic Retirement Contributions are af fected by certain Code limitations. In
particular , the Plan is designed to benefit eligible employees whose Automatic Retirement Contributions under the Savings Plan are
curtailed by the limitation on compensation under Code section 401(a)(17) or the limitation on annual additions under Code section
415, or who have any other reductions in Automatic Retirement Contributions as a result of the employee’ s deferrals under the
PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program (the “EID Program).
The Plan was originally ef fective as of January 1, 201 1. Also as of the beginning of the day on this date, the PBG
Supplemental Savings Plan (the “PBG Plan”) mer ged with and into this Plan. Appendix A of this Plan sets forth special provision
applicable to amounts that were earned under the PBG Plan.
The Plan is amended and restated ef fective as of April 1, 2016.
At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the Code and ERISA. The benefits of an executive are an
obligation of that executive’ s individual employer . With respect to his or her employer , the executive has the rights of an unsecured
general creditor .

(c) Rule of Administrative Convenience . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator shall apply the

period that begins on any April 1, if as of the preceding December 31 the employee would be a Key
Employee under the provisions of subsection (a) above. If the preceding sentence and the methods for
identifying Key Employees set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) above, taken together , would result in more than
200 individuals being counted as Key Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the
number of individuals treated as Key Employees pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2), who are not described in
the first sentence of this paragraph (3), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those

Section 409A.
Section 409A of the Code.
Separation fr om Service.
A Participant’ s separation from service with the PepsiCo Or ganization, within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i).
The term may also be used as a verb (i.e., “Separates from Service”) with no change in meaning. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, a Participant’ s transfer to an entity owned 20% or more by the Company will not constitute a
Separation of Service to the extent permitted by Section 409A. The following principles shall generally apply in
determining when a Separation from Service occurs:
(a) A Participant separates from service with the Company if the Employee has a termination of employment with the
Company other than for death. Whether a termination of employment has occurred is determined based on whether
the facts and circumstances indicate that the Company and the Employee reasonably anticipated that no further
services would be performed after a certain date or that
8
the level of bona fide services the Employee would perform after such date (as an employee or independent
contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services
performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period in which the Employee provided
services to the Company if the Employee has been providing services for less than 36 months).
(b) An Employee will not be deemed to have experienced a Separation from Service if such Employee is on military
leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence, to the extent such leave does not exceed a period of six months
or, if longer , such longer period of time during which a right to re-employment is protected by either statute or
contract. If the period of leave exceeds six months and the individual does not retain a right to re-employment under
an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date
immediately following such six-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to
any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected
to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the Employee to be unable
to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a 29-
month period of absence shall be substituted for such six-month period. In the case of such a disability leave of
absence, a Separation from Service shall occur on the earlier of the date that the Participant has reached 29
continuous months of disability leave of absence or the date that the Participant formally resigns his employment
with the Employer and the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(c) If an Employee provides services both an as employee and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company ,
the services provided as a Director are generally not taken into account in determining whether the Employee has
Separated from Service as an Employee for purposes of the Plan, in accordance with final regulations under Section
409A.
9
United States.
Any of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. V irgin Islands.

An Employee who becomes a Participant under the Plan shall cease to be a Participant on the date his or her Account is
fully distributed as provided in Article VI.
3.4    Agreements Not to Participate.
The eligibility provisions of this Article III will be subject to any other documents that constitute part of an agreement
between the Company and an Employee that limits or bars the Employee’ s participation in this Plan. An agreement that is

11
ARTICLE IV – CONTRIBUTIONS
4.1    Equalized Automatic Retir ement Contributions.
As of each payroll date for which an Employee is an Eligible Employee, the Employer shall make an Equalized Automatic
Retirement Contribution to the ARC Equalization Account of such Eligible Employee.  Subject to Section 4.2 below , the
amount of each Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution shall equal –
(a) The Eligible Employee’ s Total Automatic Retirement Contribution for such payroll date, reduced by
(b) The amount of the Automatic Retirement Contribution to which the Eligible Employee is entitled under the Savings
Plan for the same payroll date.
An Eligible Employee’ s “Total Automatic Retirement Contribution” is determined in the same way the Eligible Employee’ s
Automatic Retirement Contribution is required to be determined as of such payroll date under the Savings Plan, but with the
following modifications: (i) the limitation on compensation imposed by Code section 401(a)(17), as otherwise applied by
the terms of the Savings Plan, shall be disregarded, (ii) the limitation on annual additions imposed by Code section 415, as
otherwise applied by the terms of the Savings Plan, shall be disregarded, and (iii) any exclusion, which is then in ef fect of
amounts deferred by the Eligible Employee under the EID Program from his or her Eligible Pay under the Savings Plan
shall be disregarded. The three modifications in the preceding sentence shall be applied so that they do not result in any
duplication ( e.g., the provisions of (iii) above shall not result in an amount of T otal Automatic Retirement Contribution to
the extent such amount is provided by (ii) above).
4.2    Maximum Equalized Automatic Retir ement Contributions.
An Eligible Employee shall cease having Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions made to his or her ARC
Equalization Account during any Plan Y ear as necessary to ensure that the sum of his or her Equalized Automatic
Retirement Contributions under this Plan and Automatic Retirement Contributions under the Savings Plan (collectively , the
“Aggregate Employer Contributions”) equal or do not exceed the Code section 401(a)
12
(17) limit in ef fect for such Plan Y ear. An Eligible Employee’ s Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution for a payroll
date shall be reduced to comply with this Section by taking into account all Aggregate Employer Contributions, payable for
all prior payroll dates in the Plan Y ear, and Automatic Retirement Contributions under the Savings Plan payable for the
current payroll date.
4.3    Offsets.
Notwithstanding an Eligible Employee’ s rights under Section 4.1 (or a Participant’ s rights under Articles V and VI), the
Company may reduce the amount of any payment or benefit that is or would become payable to or on behalf of an Eligible
Employee or Participant by the amount of any obligation of the Eligible Employee or Participant to the Company that is or
becomes due and payable, provided that (a) the obligation of the Eligible Employee or Participant to the Company was
incurred during the employment relationship, (b) the reduction may not exceed the amount allowed under Section 409A and
Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(xiii), and (c) the reduction is made at the same time and in the same amount as
the obligation otherwise would have been due and collectable from the Employee or Participant. Consistent with this,
appropriate reductions may be made in (i) the Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution s that otherwise would be
provided to the Eligible Employee under Section 4.1, (ii) the balance in the Participant’ s Account under Article V , or (iii)
the Participant’ s distributions under Article VI. The application of this Section 4.2 is solely in the independent discretion of
the Company .
13
ARTICLE V – P ARTICIP ANT ACCOUNTS
5.1    Accounting for Participants’ Inter ests.
Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions shall be credited to a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account at the same
time that the Participant’ s Automatic Retirement Contributions under the Savings Plan are required to be allocated to the
Participant’ s Profit-Sharing Account under the Savings Plan (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter) . A
Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account is a bookkeeping device to track the notional value of the Participant’ s Equalized
Automatic Retirement Contributions (and his or her Employer ’s liability therefor). No assets shall be reserved or segregated
in connection with any ARC Equalization Account, and no ARC Equalization Account shall be funded, insured or
otherwise secured.
5.2    Investment Earnings and Losses.    
As of each V aluation Date, a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account shall be credited with earnings and gains (and shall
be debited for expenses and losses) determined as if the amounts credited to his or her ARC Equalization Account had
actually been invested as directed by the Participant in accordance with this Article. The Plan provides only for “phantom
investments,” and therefore such earnings, gains, expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual. However , they shall
be applied to measure the value of a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account and the amount of his or her Employer ’s
liability to make deferred payments to or on behalf of the Participant.
5.3    Investment of Accounts.
(a) In General . A Participant’ s Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions shall be invested on a phantom basis
among the investment options that are available for Automatic Retirement Contributions under the Savings Plan
from time to time, unless otherwise determined by the PIC. The PIC may discontinue any phantom investment
option with respect to some or all Accounts, and it may provide rules for transferring a Participant’ s phantom
investment from the discontinued option to a specified replacement option (unless the Participant selects another
14
replacement option in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose).
(b) Investment and Reinvestment Elections . The Participant’ s Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution for a
payroll date shall be invested on a phantom basis in the investment options and in the proportions specified by the
Participant in accordance with rules applied by the Plan Administrator . Such rules shall be based on those that apply
for purposes of Automatic Retirement Contributions under the Savings Plan as of such payroll date, except as
otherwise provided for by the Plan Administrator . To the extent a Participant does not specify an investment option
for an Equalized Automatic Retirement Contribution, the rules for default investments that are in ef fect under the
Savings Plan as of such payment date shall apply . In addition, a Participant shall have the same right to change the
investment of the Participant’ s future Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions and to reinvest the balance of
his or her ARC Equalization Account as the Participant has for his or her Automatic Retirement Contributions and
the account or subaccount that holds such contributions under the Savings Plan, except as otherwise provided for by
the Plan Administrator .
(c) Phantom Investment Options . The Plan’ s phantom investment options shall be described in materials provided to
Participants from time to time. Any of these phantom investment options shall be administered under procedures
implemented from time to time by the Plan Administrator . Unless otherwise specified in these materials or
procedures, in the case of any such phantom investment option that is based on a unitized fund, an amount deferred
or transferred into such option is converted to phantom units in the applicable fund of equivalent value by dividing
such amount by the NA V of a unit in such fund on the V aluation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested
in this option by the Plan Administrator . Thereafter , a Participant’ s interest in each such phantom option is valued as
of a V aluation Date (or a Distribution V aluation Date) by multiplying the number of
15
phantom units credited to his or her ARC Equalization Account on such date by the NA V of a unit in such fund on
such date.
5.4    Vesting.
A Participant shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, the Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account at the
time the Participant becomes fully vested in his or her ARC Account under the Savings Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Participant’ s period of Service (as determined under the Savings Plan for purposes of vesting) would extend
beyond the Participant’ s Separation from Service date because of a leave of absence, the Plan Administrator may provide
for determining the Participant’ s nonforfeitable right to his or her ARC Equalization Account by projecting the benefit the
Participant would have if all such Service were taken into account under this Plan.
5.5    Pr ohibited Misconduct.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary , if the Plan Administrator determines that a
Participant has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his or her
Separation from Service, the Participant shall forfeit all Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions and any net
earnings or gains (whether paid previously , being paid currently or payable in the future), and his or her ARC
Equalization Account shall be adjusted to reflect such forfeiture and previously paid Equalized Automatic
Retirement Contributions and net earnings or gains shall be recovered.
(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly , by a Participant shall constitute Prohibited
Misconduct:
(1) The Participant accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility , or acquiring any
ownership interest, which involves the Participant’ s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity
that markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business
entity makes retail sales or consumes
16
Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
(2) The Participant, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Participant’ s
recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Or ganization employee to
leave the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s employment or to accept any position with any other entity .
(3) The Participant using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo
Organization other than as necessary in his or her position with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Such confidential
information shall include all non-public information the Participant acquired as a result of his or her
positions with the PepsiCo Or ganization. Examples of such confidential information include non-public
information about the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition
targets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines
and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
(4) The Participant engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Or ganization’ s best
interests, including violating the Company’ s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities
of the Company or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment
with the PepsiCo Or ganization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(5) The Participant engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Participant from communicating with government
authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Company , participating in
government investigations, and/or
17
receiving any applicable award for providing information to government authorities. The Company
nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately
protected by the privilege. Further , pursuant to the Defend T rade Secrets Act, an individual shall not be held
criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that
(A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government of ficial, either directly or indirectly , or
to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B)
is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under
seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of
law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the
court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B)
does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order .
For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director ,
officer, employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice,
guidance or suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of
such a business entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products”
shall mean any product that falls into one or more of the following categories, so long as the PepsiCo Or ganization
is producing, marketing, selling or licensing such product anywhere in the world – beverages, including without
limitation carbonated soft drinks, tea, water , juice drinks, sports drinks, cof fee drinks, ener gy drinks, and value-
added dairy drinks; juices and juice products; dairy products; snacks, including salty snacks, sweet snacks meat
snacks, granola and cereal bars, and cookies; hot cereals; pancake mixes; value-added rice products; pancake syrups;
value-added pasta products; ready-to-eat cereals; dry pasta products; or any
18
product or service that the Participant had reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo Or ganization
during the Participant’ s employment with the PepsiCo Or ganization.
19
ARTICLE VI – P AYMENT OF BENEFITS
6.1    Distribution Rules Generally .
A Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account shall be distributed based upon first to occur of a Participant’ s Separation from
Service or death, as provided in Sections 6.2 and 6.3, respectively . If a Participant becomes re-employed and entitled to
another distribution after the occurrence of one of the foregoing distribution events, the rules of this Article shall apply
separately to the balance in the Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account that relates to the later period of employment. In no
event shall any portion of a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account be distributed earlier or later than is allowed under
Section 409A. All distributions shall be made in a single lump sum cash payment.
6.2    Distributions Upon Separation fr om Service.
If a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account becomes distributable based upon his or her Separation from Service, such
distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows the
Participant’ s Distribution V aluation Date, subject to Section 6.4 below (Delay for Key Employees).
6.3    Distributions Upon Death.
(a) If a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account becomes distributable based upon the Participant’ s death, such
distribution shall be distributed in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows
the Participant’ s Distribution V aluation Date.
(b) Amounts paid following a Participant’ s death shall be paid to the Participant’ s Beneficiary; provided, however , that
if no designation is in ef fect at the time of a Participant’ s death (as determined by the Plan Administrator), or if all
persons designated as Beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant, then the payments to be made pursuant to this
Section shall be distributed to the Participant’ s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner (each as defined
below), if living; otherwise in equal shares to any surviving children of the Participant; otherwise to the Participant’ s
estate. The Plan Administrator shall determine a Participant’ s
20
“Eligible Spouse” based on the state or local law where the Participant has his or her primary residence at the time
of death, and shall determine a Participant’ s “Eligible Domestic Partner” under the definition and rules that apply to
death benefits under the PepsiCo Savings Plan. The Plan Administrator is authorized to make any applicable
inquires and to request any documents, certificates or other information that it deems necessary or appropriate in
order to make the above determinations.
(c) A Participant may designate (in a manner authorized by the Plan Administrator) one or more Beneficiaries to receive
payment, in the event of his or her death, of the amounts credited to his or her ARC Equalization Account; provided
that, to be ef fective, any Beneficiary designation must be in writing, signed by the Participant, and must meet such
other standards (including any requirement for spousal consent) that the Plan Administrator or Recordkeeper shall
require from time to time. The Beneficiary designation must also be filed with the Recordkeeper prior to the
Participant’ s death, as determined by the Plan Administrator . An incomplete Beneficiary designation, as determined
by the Recordkeeper or Plan Administrator , shall be void and of no ef fect. A Beneficiary designation of an
individual by name remains in ef fect regardless of any change in the designated individual’ s relationship to the
Participant. Any Beneficiary designation submitted to the Recordkeeper that only specifies a Beneficiary by
relationship shall not be considered an ef fective Beneficiary designation and shall be void and of no ef fect. If more
than one Beneficiary is specified and the Participant fails to indicate the respective percentage applicable to two or
more Beneficiaries, then each Beneficiary for whom a percentage is not designated will be entitled to an equal share
of the portion of the ARC Equalization Account (if any) for which percentages have not been designated. At any
time, a Participant may change a Beneficiary designation for his or her ARC Equalization Account in a writing that
is signed by the Participant and filed with the Recordkeeper prior to the Participant’ s death, and that meets such
other standards as the Plan Administrator shall require from time to time. An individual who is otherwise a
21
Beneficiary with respect to a Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account ceases to be a Beneficiary when all payments
have been made from the ARC Equalization Account.
(d) Any claim to be paid any amounts standing to the credit of a Participant in connection with the Participant’ s death
must be received by the Plan Administrator at least 14 days before any such amount is actually distributed by the
Plan. Any claim received thereafter is untimely , and it shall be unenforceable against the Plan, the Company , the
Plan Administrator or any other party acting for one or more of them.
6.4    Delay for Key Employees.
(a) If the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of the Participant’ s Separation from Service (or at such
other time for determining Key Employee status as may apply under Section 409A), then the time of payment based
on Separation from Service shall be determined under the provisions of Section 6.2 as if the Distribution V aluation
Date were the V aluation Date that is six months after the Distribution V aluation Date that would otherwise apply .
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, distribution in accordance with Section 6.3 or Section 6.4 shall be given
priority over distribution in accordance with this Section if it would result in an earlier commencement date of the
Participant’ s distribution.
6.5    Valuation.
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Participant’ s ARC Equalization
Account shall continue to be credited with earnings and gains (and debited for expenses and losses) as specified in Article V
until the V aluation Date that is used in determining the amount of the distribution under this Article.
6.6    Actual Payment Date.
An amount payable on a date specified in this Article VI shall be paid no later than the later of (a) the end of the calendar
year in which the specified date occurs, or (b) the 15th
22
day of the third calendar month following such specified date. In no event shall the Participant (or Beneficiary) be permitted
to designate the taxable year of the payment. The payment date may be delayed further in accordance with one or more
applicable special rules under Section 409A that permit such later payment (for example, in the event of a bona fide dispute
that meets the requirements of T reasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(g)).
23
ARTICLE VII – PLAN ADMINISTRA TION
7.1    Plan Administrator .
The Plan Administrator is responsible for the administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator has the authority to name
one or more delegates to carry out certain responsibilities hereunder , as specified in the definition of Plan Administrator .
Any such delegation shall state the scope of responsibilities being delegated and is subject to Section 7.06 below .
7.2    Action.
Action by the Plan Administrator may be taken in accordance with procedures that the Plan Administrator adopts from time
to time or that the Company’ s Law Department determines are legally permissible.
7.3    Powers of the Plan Administrator .
The Plan Administrator shall administer and manage the Plan and shall have (and shall be permitted to delegate) all powers
necessary to accomplish that purpose, including the following:
(a) To exercise its discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and administer this Plan;
(b) To exercise its discretionary authority to make all decisions regarding eligibility , participation and deferrals, to make
allocations and determinations required by this Plan, and to maintain records regarding Participants’ Accounts;
(c) To compute and certify to the Employers the amount and kinds of payments to Participants or their Beneficiaries,
and to determine the time and manner in which such payments are to be paid;
(d) To authorize all disbursements by the Employer pursuant to this Plan;
(e) To maintain (or cause to be maintained) all the necessary records for administration of this Plan;
24
(f) To make and publish such rules for the regulation of this Plan as are not inconsistent with the terms hereof;

(i) To hire agents, accountants, actuaries, consultants and legal counsel to assist in operating and administering the

Plan Administrator or the Recordkeeper may take any action the Plan Administrator deems is necessary to assure
compliance with any policy of the Company respecting insider trading as may be in ef fect from time to time. Such
actions may include altering the ef fective date of intra-fund transfers or the distribution date of Participant’ s
Accounts. Any such actions shall alter the normal operation of the Plan to the minimum extent necessary .
The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all
questions of eligibility for benefits, to determine the amount and manner of payment of such benefits and to make any
determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this Plan, and its decisions on such matters will
be final and conclusive on all parties. Any such decision or determination shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted
discretion of the Plan Administrator , even if (1) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question,
or (2) a determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions
expressly grant discretion or call for a determination. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan
Administrator decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled to them. In the event of a review by a court, arbitrator or
any other tribunal, any exercise of the Plan Administrator ’s discretionary authority shall not be disturbed unless it is clearly
shown to be arbitrary and capricious.
25
7.4    Compensation, Indemnity and Liability .
The Plan Administrator will serve without bond and without compensation for services hereunder . All expenses of the Plan
and the Plan Administrator will be paid by the Employers. To the extent deemed appropriate by the Plan Administrator , any
such expense may be char ged against specific Participant Accounts, thereby reducing the obligation of the Employers. No
member of the P AC (which serves as the Plan Administrator) or PIC, and no individual acting as the delegate of the P AC or
PIC, shall be liable for any act or omission of any other member or individual, nor for any act or omission on his or her own
part, excepting his or her own willful misconduct. The Employers (other than the Company) will indemnify and hold
harmless each member of the P AC and PIC and any employee of the Company (or a Company af filiate, if recognized as an
affiliate for this purpose by the Plan Administrator) acting as the delegate of the P AC or PIC against any and all expenses
and liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, arising in connection with this Plan out of his or her
membership on the P AC or PIC (or his or her serving as the delegate of the P AC or PIC), excepting only expenses and
liabilities arising out of his or her own willful misconduct or bad faith.
7.5    Withholding.
The Employer shall withhold from amounts due under this Plan, any amount necessary to enable the Employer to remit to
the appropriate government entity or entities on behalf of the Participant as may be required by the federal income tax
provisions of the Code, by an applicable state’ s income tax provisions, and by an applicable city , county or municipality’ s
earnings or income tax provisions. Further , the Employer shall withhold from the payroll of, or collect from, a Participant
the amount necessary to remit on behalf of the Participant any Social Security or Medicare taxes which may be required
with respect to amounts deferred or accrued by a Participant hereunder , as determined by the Employer . In addition, to the
extent required by Section 409A, amounts deferred under this Plan shall be reported on each Participant’ s Form W -2 for the
applicable tax year , and any amounts that become taxable hereunder shall be reported as taxable wages on the
26
Participant’ s Form W -2 for the applicable tax year . All such reporting and withholding shall be performed based on the rules
and procedures of Section 409A.
7.6    Conformance with Section 409A.
At all times during each Plan Y ear, this Plan shall be operated in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A. In all
cases, the provisions of this Section shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan that is not contained in
this Section.
27
ARTICLE VIII – CLAIMS PROCEDURE
8.1    Claims for Benefits.

he or she believes are due and payable under the Plan, he or she may make a claim for benefits to the Plan Administrator .
The claim for benefits must be in writing and addressed to the Plan Administrator . If the claim for benefits is denied, the
Plan Administrator will notify the Claimant within 90 days after the Plan Administrator initially received the benefit claim.
However , if special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the Plan Administrator will furnish
notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the termination of the initial 90-day period and such extension may not
exceed one additional, consecutive 90-day period. Any notice of a denial of benefits shall advise the Claimant of the basis
for the denial, any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his or her claim, and the steps
which the Claimant must take to appeal his or her claim for benefits.
8.2    Appeals of Denied Claims.
Each Claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied may file a written appeal for a review of his or her claim by the
Plan Administrator . The request for review must be filed by the Claimant within 60 days after he or she received the notice

28
8.3    Limitations on Actions.
Any claim filed under this Article VIII and any action filed in state or federal court by or on behalf of a former or current
Employee, Participant, Beneficiary or any other individual, person or entity (collectively , a “Petitioner”) for the alleged
wrongful denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought
within two years of the date the Petitioner ’s cause of action first accrues. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action
with respect to a Petitioner ’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when the
Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action (ii) the date identified
to the Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which payments shall commence, or (iii) when the Petitioner has actual or
constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim. For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with
respect to the alleged interference with ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant has actual or
constructive knowledge of the acts that are alleged to interfere with ERISA-protected rights. Failure to bring any such claim
or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner , or any representative of the Petitioner , from
filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications following the mandatory appeals process
described in Section 8.2 shall have no ef fect on this two-year time frame.
8.4 Restriction on V enue.

29
ARTICLE IX – AMENDMENT AND TERMINA TION
9.1     Amendment to the Plan.
(a) The Company , or its delegate, has the right in its sole discretion to amend this Plan in whole or in part at any time
and in any manner , including the terms and conditions of Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions, the terms
on which distributions are made, and the form and timing of distributions. However , except for mere clarifying
amendments necessary to avoid an inappropriate windfall, no Plan amendment shall reduce the balance of a
Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account as of the date such amendment is adopted. In addition, the Company shall
have the limited right to amend the Plan at any time, retroactively or otherwise, in such respects and to such extent
as may be necessary to fully qualify it under existing and applicable laws and regulations, and if and to the extent
necessary to accomplish such purpose, may by such amendment decrease or otherwise af fect benefits to which
Participants may have already become entitled, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary .
(b) The Company’ s right to amend the Plan shall not be af fected or limited in any way by a Participant’ s Separation
from Service, death or disability . Prior practices by the Company or an Employer shall not diminish in any way the
rights granted the Company under this Section. Also, it is expressly permissible for an amendment to af fect less than
all of the Participants covered by the Plan.
(c) Any amendment shall be in writing and adopted by the Company or by any of ficer of the Company who has
authority or who has been granted or delegated the authority to amend this Plan. An amendment or restatement of
this Plan shall not af fect the validity or scope of any grant or delegation of such authority , which shall instead be
solely determined based upon the terms of the grant or delegation (as determined under applicable law). All
Participants and Beneficiaries shall be bound by such amendment.
30
(d) Any amendments made to the Plan shall be subject to any restrictions on amendment that are applicable to ensure
continued compliance under Section 409A.
9.2    Termination of Plan.
(a) The Company expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do so. The Company reserves the right to
discontinue and terminate the Plan at any time, in whole or in part, for any reason (including a change, or an
impending change, in the tax laws of the United States or any State within the United States). Termination of the
Plan will be binding on all Participants (and a partial termination shall be binding upon all af fected Participants) and
their Beneficiaries, but in no event may such termination reduce the amounts credited at that time to any
Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account. If this Plan is terminated (in whole or in part), the termination resolution
shall provide for how amounts theretofore credited to af fected Participants’ ARC Equalization Accounts will be
distributed.
(b) This Section is subject to the same restrictions related to compliance with Section 409A that apply to Section 9.1. In
accordance with these restrictions, the Company intends to have the maximum discretionary authority to terminate
the Plan and make distributions in connection with a Change in Control (as defined in Section 409A), and the
maximum flexibility with respect to how and to what extent to carry this out following a Change in Control (as
defined in Section 409A) as is permissible under Section 409A. The previous sentence contains the exclusive terms
under which a distribution may be made in connection with any Change in Control with respect to deferrals made
under this 409A Program.
31
ARTICLE X – MISCELLANEOUS
10.1    Limitation on Participant Rights.
Participation in this Plan does not give any Participant the right to be retained in the Employer's or Company's employ (or
any right or interest in this Plan or any assets of the Company or Employer other than as herein provided). The Company
and Employer reserve the right to terminate the employment of any Participant without any liability for any claim against
the Company or Employer under this Plan, except for a claim for payment of benefits as provided herein.
10.2    Unfunded Obligation of Individual Employer .

32
the terms of such other employee benefit plan or plans specifically provide otherwise or it would cause such other plan to
violate a requirement for tax-favored treatment.
10.4    Receipt or Release.
Any payment to a Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in
full satisfaction of all claims against the Plan Administrator , the Employer and the Company , and the Plan Administrator

such ef fect.

held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to
be fully ef fective.
10.6    Adoption of Plan by Related Employers.
The Plan Administrator may select as an Employer any division of the Company , as well as any member of the PepsiCo
Organization, and permit or cause such division or or ganization to adopt the Plan. The selection by the Plan Administrator
shall govern the ef fective date of the adoption of the Plan by such related Employer . The requirements for Plan adoption are
entirely within the discretion of the Plan Administrator and, in any case where the status of an entity as an Employer is at
issue, the determination of the Plan Administrator shall be absolutely conclusive.

limitation on its breadth of application).
(c) Compounds of the W ord “Here” . The words "hereof", “herein”, "hereunder" and other similar compounds of the

(f) Invalid Provisions . If any provision of this Plan is, or is hereafter declared to be void, voidable, invalid or otherwise
unlawful, the remainder of the Plan shall not be af fected thereby .

APPENDIX A – MERGER OF PBG SUPPLEMENT AL SA VINGS PLAN
A.1    Scope.
This Article sets forth special provisions applicable to amounts earned under the PBG Supplemental Savings Plan (“PBG
Plan”) prior to the mer ger of that plan with and into this Plan. Amounts earned under the PBG Plan prior to the mer ger shall
be credited to a subaccount of the Participant’ s ARC Equalization Account (“PBG Plan Subaccount”). All other defined
terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to such term under Article II unless otherwise indicated.
A.2    Pr ovisions Applicable to Amounts Earned Under PBG Plan.
Except as otherwise set forth in this Section A.2, the terms and conditions applicable to a Participant’ s PBG Plan
Subaccount are governed by the prior document for the PBG Plan.
(a) Investment Mapping . A Participant’ s PBG Plan Subaccount shall be mapped to the phantom investment options that
are available for Equalized Automatic Retirement Contributions under Article V of this Plan according to the same
mapping method that will apply for purposes of transferring the Participants’ account balance under the PBG
Savings Plan to the investment options available under the Savings Plan, except as otherwise provided by the Plan
Administrator . Once the Participant’ s PBG Plan Subaccount balance has been mapped as provided in the preceding
sentence, the PBG Plan Subaccount shall be subject to the investment provisions set forth in Article V .
(b) Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund . Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the portion of a Participant’ s PBG
Plan Subaccount that is invested in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund shall not be subject to mapping, but
instead shall remain invested in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund until such time as the Participant makes
a reinvestment election. Thereafter , such portion of the Participant’ s PBG Plan Subaccount shall remain eligible for
investment and reinvestment in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund
38
(notwithstanding any restrictions on investment in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund that may apply
generally under Article V) in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose.
(c) Time and Form of Payment . A Participant’ s PBG Plan Subaccount shall be paid on the first day of the calendar
month following the Distribution V aluation Date that next follows the earliest of the following:
(1) The Participant’ s Separation from Service;
(2) The Participant’ s death; or
(3) A change in control of the Participant’ s Employer (other than the successor to the Pepsi Bottling Group,
Inc.), as defined in Section 409A.
Distributions upon Separation from Service under this subsection shall be subject to Section 6.5 (Delay for Key
Employees), except that no priority shall be given to Section 6.4.
(d) Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund Restrictions. To the extent necessary to ensure compliance with Rule 16b-
3(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”), the Company may arrange for tracking of any such
transaction defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(1) of the Act involving the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund and the
Company may bar any such transaction to the extent it would not be exempt under Rule 16b-3(f). The Company will
impose blackout periods pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 whenever the Company
determines that circumstances warrant. Further , the Company may impose quarterly blackout periods on insider
trading in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund as need (as determined by the Company), timed to coincide
with the release of the Company’ s quarterly earnings reports. The commencement and termination of these blackout
periods in each quarter , the parties to which they apply and the activities they restrict shall be as set forth in the
official insider trading policy promulgated by the Company from time to time.
39
(e)    Impact of Securities Law on Distributions. The provisions of (d) above and this subparagraph (e), shall
apply in determining whether a Participant’ s distribution shall be delayed beyond the date applicable under Article
VI of the Plan.
(i)    In General. This Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of Section 16 of the Act.
Accordingly , in the case of a deferral or other action under the Plan that constitutes a transaction that could be
covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e) of the Act, if it were approved by the Company’ s Board of Directors or the
Compensation Committee (“Board Approval”), it is intended that the Plan shall be administered by delegates of the
Compensation Committee, in the case of a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act, in a manner that will
permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any additional Board Approval of specific transactions to the
maximum possible extent.
(ii)    Approval of Distributions. This subsection shall govern the distribution of a deferral that (i) is wholly
or partly invested in the Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund at the time the deferral would be valued to
determine the amount of cash to be distributed to a Participant, (ii) was not covered by an agreement, made at the
time of the Participant’ s original phantom investment election, that any investments in the phantom PepsiCo
Common Stock Fund would, once made, remain in that fund until distribution, (iii) is made to a Participant who is
subject to Section 16 of the Act at the time the interest in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund would be
liquidated in connection with the distribution, and (iv) if paid at the time the distribution would be made without
regard to this subsection, could result in a violation of Section 16 of the Act because there is an opposite way
transaction that would be matched with the liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the phantom PepsiCo Common
Stock Fund (either as a “discretionary transaction,” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(1), or as a regular
transaction, as applicable) (a “Covered Distribution”). In the case of a Covered Distribution, if the liquidation of the
Participant’ s interest in the
40
phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the distribution has not received Board Approval by the
time the distribution would be made if it were not a Covered Distribution, or if it is a discretionary transaction, then
the actual distribution to the Participant shall be delayed only until the earlier of:
(1)    In the case of a transaction that is not a discretionary transaction, Board Approval of the
liquidation of the Participant’ s interest in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund in connection with the
distribution, and
(2)    The date the distribution would no longer violate Section 16 of the Act, e.g., when the
Participant is no longer subject to Section 16 of the Act, when the balance related to the distribution is no
longer invested in the phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund, or when the time between the liquidation and
an opposite way transaction is suf ficient.

Participant subject to U.S. federal income tax, the Company shall distribute amounts payable to Participants in the calendar year following the
year in which the Performance Period ends and no later than March 15th of that year.
 
(i) Form of Payment. Awards will be paid in cash or cash equivalents. The Committee in its discretion may determine that all or a
portion of an Award shall be paid in stock, restricted stock, stock options or other stock-based or stock denominated units which shall be issued
pursuant to the PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan or a successor equity compensation plan in existence at the time of grant.
 
(j) Deferral of Payment of Awards. Notwithstanding Section 5(h), the Committee, in its discretion, may defer the payout or vesting of
any Award and/or provide to Participants the opportunity to elect to defer the payment of any Award under the PepsiCo Executive Income
Deferral Program or any other PepsiCo approved deferred compensation plan or arrangement. With respect to any Award (or portion thereof),
including any Award under the Company’s Premium Bonus Program, that constitutes deferred compensation subject to Section 409A and is not
otherwise exempt from Section 409A, such Award (or portion thereof) shall not be paid earlier than the date that is six months after the
Participant’s Separation from Service if the payment is based on the Participant’s Separation from Service (other than as a result of death) and
the Participant is classified as a Key Employee at the time of his or her Separation from Service.
 
(k) Certain Participants not Eligible. To be eligible for payment of any Award, the Participant must (i) be employed by the Company on
the last day of the Performance Period unless the Committee specifies otherwise, (ii) have performed the Participant’s duties to the satisfaction
of the Committee, and (iii) have not engaged in any acts that are considered by the Committee to constitute Misconduct. If the Committee
determines following the date an Award is paid that the Participant, prior to the date of payment of such Award, engaged in any acts that are
considered by the Committee to constitute Misconduct, the Participant shall be obligated, upon demand, to return the amount of such Award to
the Company.
 
6.  Miscellaneous Provisions.
 
(a) Effect on Benefit Plans. Awards shall not be considered eligible pay under other plans, benefit arrangements or fringe benefit
arrangements of the Company unless otherwise provided under the terms of such other plans.
 
(b) Restriction on Transfer. Awards (or interests therein) or amounts payable with respect to a Participant under the Plan are not
subject to transfer, assignment or alienation, whether voluntary or involuntary.
(c) Withholding Taxes. PepsiCo or any subsidiary or division thereof, as appropriate, shall have the right to deduct from all payments
hereunder any federal, state, local or foreign taxes or social contributions required by law to be withheld with respect to such awards. The
Participant shall be solely responsible for the satisfaction of any federal, state, local or foreign taxes on payments under the Plan.
 
(d) No Rights to Awards. Except as set forth herein, no Company employee or other person shall have any claim or right to be
granted an award under the Plan. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any employee any right to be
retained in the employ of PepsiCo or
4
any of its subsidiaries, divisions or affiliates or to interfere with the ability of the Company to terminate any such employee’s employment
relationship at any time. At no time before the actual payment of an Award shall any Participant or other person accrue any vested interest or
right whatsoever under the Plan, and the Company has no obligation to treat Participants identically under the Plan.
 
(e) Costs and Expenses. The cost and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and shall not be charged
to any Award or to any Participant receiving an Award.
 
(f) No Funding of Plan. The Plan shall be unfunded, and the Awards shall be paid solely from the general assets of the Company. The
Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payment of
any Award under the Plan. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments under the Plan, the right is no greater than the
right of any other unsecured general creditor.
 
(g) Offset for Monies Owed. Any payments made under the Plan will be offset for any monies that are owed to the Company to the
extent permitted by applicable law, including Section 409A if such payment is subject to Section 409A.
 
(h) Other Incentive Plans. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prohibit the Company from granting other performance awards to
employees of the Company (including Participants) under such other incentive arrangements, and in such form and manner, as it deems
desirable.
 
(i) Successors. All obligations of PepsiCo under the Plan shall be binding on any successor to PepsiCo whether the existence of such
successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise of all or substantially all of the business or assets of
PepsiCo.
 
(j) Section 409A. To the extent that any Award under the Plan is subject to Section 409A, the terms and administration of such Award
shall comply with the provisions of Section 409A, and, to the extent necessary to achieve compliance, shall be modified at the discretion of the
Committee. The Company makes no representation that any Award is exempt from or complies with Section 409A and makes no undertaking
to preclude Section 409A from applying to Awards. The Company will have no liability to any Participant or to any other party if an Award that is
intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee with respect
thereto.
 
(k) Severability. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or
deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the
Committee, materially altering the purpose or intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, and the
remainder of the Plan or Award shall remain in full force and effect.
 
(l) Governing Law. The Plan and all rights and awards hereunder shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of
the State of New York.
 
7.  Effective Date, Amendments and Termination.
 
(a) Effective Date. The Plan, as amended and restated by the Committee on February 13, 2019, shall be effective for Awards granted
on or after such date.
(b) Amendments. The Committee may at any time terminate or from time to time amend the Plan in whole or in part, but no such
action shall adversely affect any rights or obligations with respect to any Awards theretofore made under the Plan.
 
5
(c) Termination. The Plan shall continue in effect until terminated by the Committee.
