PART I
Item 1—Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are
principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, United
Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Spain, France, China, and Iceland. Costco operated 838, 815, and 795 warehouses worldwide at
August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.”
We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first
three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week
year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2022,
2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively.
General
We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited
selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory
turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of
merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross
margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while
taking advantage of early payment discounts.
We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our
warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight
volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. For our e-commerce operations
we ship merchandise through our depots, our logistics operations for big and bulky items, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery
arrangements with our suppliers.

Table of Contents
Our average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for
economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted
principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and
using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.
Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of
operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower
relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large
quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-
branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary
stored-value card (shop card).
Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than
elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per
warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs
online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack
quantities only.
In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a
90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty
coverage is sold on certain electronic items.
We offer merchandise and services in the following categories:
Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):
•Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)
•Non-Foods (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, garden and patio, sporting goods, tires, toys and
seasonal, office supplies, automotive care, postage, tickets, apparel, small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order
kiosk, and jewelry)
•Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)
Warehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-
commerce, business centers, travel, and other)
Warehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number
of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas
stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.
Our other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations (core and warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-
commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services. Net sales for e-commerce represented
approximately 7% of total net sales in 2022. This figure does not include other services we offer online in certain countries such as business
delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services,
convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco
Travel offers vacation packages, hotels, cruises, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the
U.K.).

Table of Contents
We have direct buying relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise
from any one supplier. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints, including disruptions and delays that have impacted
and could continue to impact the flow and availability of certain products. When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternatives. We
also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is
significant.
Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Report.
Membership
Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and websites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household
card.
Our member renewal rate was 93% in the U.S. and Canada and 90% worldwide at the end of 2022. The majority of members renew within six
months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. At the end of 2020, we standardized our membership count
methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in the addition to the count of approximately 2.0 million total
cardholders for 2020, of which 1.3 million were paid members. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected. Our
membership was made up of the following (in thousands):
2022 2021 2020
Gold Star 54,000 50,200 46,800 
Business, including affiliates 11,800 11,500 11,300 
Total paid members 65,800 61,700 58,100 
Household cards 53,100 49,900 47,400 
    Total cardholders 118,900 111,600 105,500 
Paid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, for which the additional fee varies. Executive members
earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses. This
program also offers (except in Mexico and Korea) access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such
as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. These services are generally provided by third parties and
vary by state and country. Executive members totaled 29.1 million and represented 57% of paid members (excluding affiliates) in the U.S. and
Canada, and 22% of paid members (excluding affiliates) in our Other International operations. The sales penetration of Executive members
represented approximately 71% of worldwide net sales in 2022.

Human Capital
Our Code of Ethics requires that we “Take Care of Our Employees,” which is fundamental to the obligation to “Take Care of Our Members.” We
must also carefully control our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low
prices. Compensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is carefully monitored.
Employee Base
At the end of 2022, we employed 304,000 employees worldwide. The large majority (approximately 95%) is employed in our membership
warehouses and distribution channels, and less than 10% are represented by unions. We also utilize seasonal employees during peak periods.
The total number of employees by segment is:
Number of Employees
2022 2021 2020
United States 202,000 192,000 181,000 
Canada 50,000 47,000 46,000 
Other International 52,000 49,000 46,000 
Total employees 304,000 288,000 273,000 
Growth and Engagement
We believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry, owing in substantial part to the commitment and efficiency
of our employees. We seek to provide them not merely with employment but careers. Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective;
the more significant include: competitive compensation and benefits for those working in our membership warehouses and distributions
channels; a commitment to promoting from within; and maintaining a ratio of at least 50% of our employee base being full-time employees.
These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for the industry, a high retention rate. In 2022, in the U.S. that rate was approximately
90% for employees who have been with us for at least one year.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
The commitment to “Take Care of Our Employees” is also the foundation of our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion and creating an
inclusive and respectful workplace. In 2022, we appointed a new Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer. Embracing differences is important to the
growth of our Company. It leads to more opportunities, innovation, and employee satisfaction and connects us to the communities where we do
business.
Well Being
In October 2021, we provided an increase of a minimum of $0.50 per hour for U.S. and Canada wage scales. In March 2022, we provided
certain compensation increases, including a $0.75 per hour increase to the top of the U.S. wage scales, increased the starting wage to $17.50,
and granted our employees one additional day of paid time off. In July 2022, we provided an additional increase to the top of the U.S. wage
scales of $0.50 per hour. Costco is firmly committed to helping protect the health and safety of our members and employees and to serving our
communities. As the global effect of COVID-19 continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring the changing situation and complying with public
health guidance.

website). This report and other information on our website are not incorporated by reference into and do not form any part of this Annual Report.

Competition
Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution
strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including
supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a
single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail
competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club. Many of the
major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs.
Intellectual Property
We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names
and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the
development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland
Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and help
lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration
of our private-label items.
We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers,
employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however,
trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.
Available Information

of charge by writing to Secretary, Costco Wholesale Corporation, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA 98027. If the Company makes any amendments
to this code (other than technical, administrative, or non-substantive amendments) or grants any waivers, including implicit waivers, to the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or principal accounting officer and controller, we will disclose (on our website or in a Form 8-K report
filed with the SEC) the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date, and to whom it applies.

Item 1A—Risk Factors
The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also be
affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us
or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of
this Report.
Business and Operating Risks
We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.
Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 85% of net
sales and operating income in 2022, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 28%
of U.S. net sales in 2022. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other
domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial
results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among
other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including
increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new
warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including
higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.
We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets,
and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other
retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses
and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local
laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and
of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on
acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or
expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may
affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future
growth and profitability.
We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing
warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability.
We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity
with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in
the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established
market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce websites will be profitable and future profitability could be
delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.

Table of Contents
We have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and
delivery channels. The effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the
anticipated benefits or desired rates of return.
Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.
Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the
penetration of Executive membership, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation
may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee
revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.
We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these
products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand
products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or
confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.
Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and
member satisfaction.
We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. We also rely upon
processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.
Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme
weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of
merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce operations depend
heavily on third-party and in-house logistics providers and is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide services in a timely
fashion.
We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our
members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our
ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing
consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to environmental, social and governance practices) and spending patterns could
negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at
predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns,
or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating
performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.
Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business. Failure to successfully execute IT
projects and have IT systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations.
IT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions, conduct
payment transactions, track and value our inventory and produce reports critical for making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these
systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing
plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. We are undertaking large technology and
IT transformation projects. The failure of these
10
Table of Contents
projects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day to day business operations. Given the high volume of
transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer
and telecommunications failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires,
earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers and backup systems would require
significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of
business services, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making substantial
investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business.
Failure to deliver IT transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our
financial condition and results of operations.
We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst multiplying threat landscapes and
in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations globally. Failure to do so could damage our business, including our
reputation with members, suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation
and regulatory action.
Increased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon
IT systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with virtually all of our business activities. Additionally, we
collect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, members, suppliers and employees. Operating these IT systems and
networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased remote
work has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Threats designed to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks and data, both ours
and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to
coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats. Phishing attacks have emerged as
particularly prominent, including as vectors for ransomware attacks, which have increased in breadth and frequency. While we train our
employees as part of our security efforts, that training cannot be completely effective. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems
and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. It is possible that our IT systems and networks, or those managed by
third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host confidential information, could have vulnerabilities, which could go
unnoticed for a period of time. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the
actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems,
information or other property.
The potential impacts of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties,
disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our
investment in IT systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our competitiveness, results
of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model, loss of member confidence. Further, the insurance coverage we
maintain and indemnification arrangements with third-parties may be inadequate to cover claims, costs, and liabilities relating to cybersecurity
incidents. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the
European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and
other privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe, which may carry significant potential penalties for
noncompliance.

We are subject to payment-related risks.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates,
Executive member 2% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to
additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other
related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing
services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these
services to us. We are also subject to fee increases by these service providers.
We must comply with evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements
and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which contain
compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of
individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines
and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be
adversely affected.
We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation.
If our merchandise, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children's products, pet products and durable
goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety or labeling standards or our members' expectations, we could experience lost
sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses
or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects,
substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or
faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure
that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to
comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause
illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product
recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is
not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand
image, and these effects could be long-term.
If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could
be adversely impacted.
Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our
competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through
social media. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant
member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Our success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior management and other key operations,
IT, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively
impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs
and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including the
continuing impacts of the pandemic, regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, union relations and healthcare and other insurance costs. We
compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There
is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.
Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle
liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks
to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with
respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care
or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.
Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a
result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of
inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.
Market and Other External Risks
We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects
with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other
warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores
and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of
ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of
websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison
shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to
merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail
markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.
General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.
Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates,
unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related
to government fiscal
13
Table of Contents
and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, pandemics and other health crises, and
other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or
ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some
of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the
tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential
cost increases. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.
Prices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are
historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures,
labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in
commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could
also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and
financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of hostilities, including but not limited to the
Ukraine conflict, or acts of terrorism.
Inflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If
inflation on merchandise increases beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various
cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we
have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the pandemic and uncertain economic environment.
Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high
standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.
We depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require
continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to
change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of
sales and profits.
We buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or
the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from
alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which
available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available.
Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities,
financial liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and
political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere
to our quality control, packaging, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude
delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and
litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.

Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
During 2022, our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% and 32% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Our
international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare
our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars
using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of
our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we
continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.
A portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency
fluctuations may increase our merchandise costs and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates
may adversely affect our results of operations.
Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, including those impacted by climate change, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods,
earthquakes, wildfires, droughts; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; energy shortages; public health issues,
including pandemics and quarantines, particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative
personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our
properties, limitations on store operating hours, less frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary closure of warehouses,
depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or
long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or
from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our
warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or
members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or
make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects.
The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile and are affecting certain business operations, demand
for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our
ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.

Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
•The severity and duration of the pandemic, including future mutations or related variants of the virus in areas in which we operate;
•Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures;
•Changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers;
•Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other
resources to the pandemic response;
•The pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides;
•The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors; and
•Disruption and volatility within the financial and credit markets.
To the extent that COVID-19 continues to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy, our business, results of operations, cash flows, or
financial condition, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and
expectations, competition, brand reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology
systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, operational risk as a result of remote work arrangements and
regulatory requirements.
Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Government regulations limiting carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs
could materially affect our profitability. As the economy transitions to lower carbon intensity we cannot guarantee that we will make adequate
investments or successfully implement strategies that will effectively achieve our climate-related goals, which could lead to negative perceptions
among members and other stakeholders and result in reputational harm. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts and
rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience.
We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and increased
regulations. More stringent fuel economy standards and public policies aimed at increasing the adoption of zero-emission and alternative fuel
vehicles and other regulations related to climate change will affect our future operations and may adversely impact our profitability, and require
significant capital expenditures.
Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in
meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member
sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price
of our stock to decline.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
We are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the
countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
At the end of 2022, we operated 260 warehouses outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future
operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which
are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations,
16
Table of Contents
policy changes such as the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we
operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions),
monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks
associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international
operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty
in enforcing intellectual property rights.
Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex
accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are
relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by
our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could
significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure
controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within
required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and
payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.
Changes in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.
We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at
any point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may
recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations,
administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We
compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change
in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision.
Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous
materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
We are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use,
storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to
comply with these laws could result in harm to our members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance,
remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or
courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Table of Contents
Operations at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes, the use
and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized
processing equipment, and other operations that potentially could affect the environment and public health and safety. Failure to comply with
current and future environmental, health and safety standards could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, illness or injury of our
employees, and claims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or injuries, and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other
proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal
proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed
property laws, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies, including
environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits,
unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our
operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and
resources.

The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote
understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with,
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section
generally discusses the results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in
financial condition for 2021 compared to 2020 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations in our fiscal year 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October
6, 2021.
Overview
We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core
merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing
aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from
warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating
for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the
amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our
control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); inflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and
associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&A expenses,
reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making
available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.
Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or
deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and
widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While
we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in
adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration
of our private-label items, and through online offerings.
Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on
maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” –
consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced
in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to
cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-
usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost increases on to our
members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding
prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross
margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).
We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-
gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of
gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-

Table of Contents
term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross
margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect.
Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The
degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could
adversely impact our results.
We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more
difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such
growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses
when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of
square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-
commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage
relative to our warehouse operations. E-commerce sales growth slowed in 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020.
The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce
member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of
our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be
adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.
Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant
costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our
philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing
employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for
much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces.
Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly
merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.
Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the
consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher
rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or
lack e-commerce or business delivery.
In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are
the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies
into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency
exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the
difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.
Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended
August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to
rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.

Highlights for 2022 versus 2021 include:
•We opened 26 new warehouses, including 3 relocations: 14 net new in the U.S., 2 net new in our Canadian segment, and 7 new in our
Other International segment, compared to 22 new warehouses, including 2 relocations in 2021;
•Net sales increased 16% to $222,730 driven by a 14% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2021 and
2022;
•Membership fee revenue increased 9% to $4,224, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive membership, and an increase in
our renewal rate;
•Gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points, driven primarily by our core merchandise categories and a LIFO charge for higher
merchandise costs;
•SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing of
incremental wages related to COVID-19, despite additional wage and benefits increases;
•We incurred a one-time $77 pretax charge, primarily related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off in March 2022;
•The effective tax rate in 2022 was 24.6% compared to 24.0% in 2021;
•Net income increased 17% to $5,844, or $13.14 per diluted share compared to $5,007, or $11.27 per diluted share in 2021;
•In June 2022, the Company paid a cash dividend of $208 and purchased the remaining equity interest of its Taiwan operations from its
former joint-venture partner for $842, totaling $1,050 in the aggregate; and
•In April 2022, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.79 to $0.90 per share.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business during 2022, albeit to a lesser extent. COVID-related and other supply and logistics
constraints have continued to adversely affect some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. During 2021,
we paid $515 in incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ceased in February 2021.

Other International 10 % 13 % 11 %
Total Company 11 % 13 % 9 %
Net Sales
Net sales increased $30,678 or 16% during 2022. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 14%, and sales at
new warehouses opened in 2021 and 2022. Sales increased $15,830 in core merchandise categories and $14,848 in warehouse ancillary and
other businesses. The rate of increase was strongest in our gasoline, business centers, and travel businesses. Sales continued to be impacted
by inflation, higher than what we experienced in previous fiscal years.
During 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $9,230, 481 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 42% increase in the
average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 22%, positively impacting net sales by $3,847, 200 basis points.
Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,762, 92 basis points, compared to
2021, attributable primarily to our Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 14% during 2022 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket, which
includes the effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency. E-commerce comparable sales increased 10% during 2022, including inflation.

Membership fees $ 4,224$ 3,877$ 3,541
Membership fees increase 9 % 9 % 6 %
Membership fee revenue increased 9% in 2022, driven by new member sign-ups and upgrades to Executive membership. Changes in foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted membership fees by $42, compared to 2021. At the end of 2022, our member renewal
rates were 93% in the U.S. and Canada and 90% worldwide. Renewal rates continue to benefit from more members auto renewing and
increased penetration of Executive members, who on average renew at a higher rate. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business
members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for
membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period.
Gross Margin
2022 2021 2020
Net sales $ 222,730$ 192,052$ 163,220
Less merchandise costs 199,382 170,684 144,939
Gross margin $ 23,348$ 21,368$ 18,281
Gross margin percentage 10.48 % 11.13 % 11.20 %
Total gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points compared to 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross
margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. This was primarily due to a 33 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories,
predominantly driven by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries, and 19 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise
costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by one basis point due to increased 2% rewards. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses
positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was positively
impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the negative impact of a one-time
charge related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively
impacted gross margin by approximately $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International Operations.
The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales),
decreased 27 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of
changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.
Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in
gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. All segments were negatively impacted due to
decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin in our U.S.
segment was also negatively impacted by the LIFO charge. Our Other International segment was negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards.
All segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19.

SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points compared to 2021. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales
excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.26%, a decrease of 39 basis points. Warehouse operations and other businesses were
lower by 17 basis points, largely attributable to leveraging increased sales. This includes the impact of the starting wage increase we instituted in
October 2021, as well the increased wages and benefits that were effective on March 14, 2022, and July 4, 2022. SG&A expenses was
benefited by a net of 16 basis points due to the positive impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19, partially offset by higher
write-offs of certain information technology assets, and expenses related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off. Central
operating costs were lower by five basis points, and stock compensation expense was lower by one basis point. Changes in foreign currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $148, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International
operations.
Interest Expense
2022 2021 2020
Interest expense $ 158 $ 171 $ 160 
Interest expense primarily relates to Senior Notes and financing leases. Interest expense decreased in 2022 due to repayment of the 2.300%

The effective tax rate for 2022 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $130. This included $94 of excess tax benefits related to stock
compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.2% for 2022.
The effective tax rate for 2021 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $163. This included $75 of excess tax benefits related to stock
compensation, $70 related to the special cash dividend paid through our 401(k) plan, and $19 related to a reduction in the valuation allowance
against certain deferred tax assets. Excluding net discrete tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% for 2021.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:
2022 2021 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,392 $ 8,958 $ 8,861 
Net cash used in investing activities (3,915) (3,535) (3,891)
Net cash used in financing activities (4,283) (6,488) (1,147)
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash
and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $11,049 and $12,175 at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these balances,
unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,010 and $1,816 at the end of 2022 and 2021. These receivables
generally settle within four days. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted cash and cash equivalents negatively by $249 in 2022, and
positively by $46 and $70 in 2021 and 2020.
Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related
interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included
in Item 8 of this Report for amounts outstanding on August 28, 2022, related to debt and leases.
Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in
the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new
and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months.
Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows with capacity under existing and available credit
agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and
projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $7,392 in 2022, compared to $8,958 in 2021. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily
from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse
operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations also
includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise
inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by
28
Table of Contents
several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our
suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $3,915 in 2022, compared to $3,535 in 2021, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net
cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
Capital Expenditures
Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required
for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In 2022, we spent $3,891 on
capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,800 to $4,000 during fiscal 2023. These expenditures are expected
to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 26 new warehouses,
including three relocations, in 2022, and plan to open approximately up to 29 additional new warehouses, including four relocations, in 2023.
There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital
expenditure needs or based on the economic environment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $4,283 in 2022, compared to $6,488 in 2021. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related
to the payment of dividends, payments to our former joint-venture partner for a dividend and the purchase of their equity interest in Taiwan,
totaling $1,050 in the aggregate, repayments of our 2.300% Senior Notes, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock
awards.
Stock Repurchase Programs
During 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 863,000 and 1,358,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $511.46 and $364.39,
respectively, totaling approximately $442 and $495, respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the
accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases
are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1.
Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased
under our approved plan was $2,808 at the end of 2022.
Dividends
Cash dividends declared in 2022 totaled $3.38 per share, as compared to $12.98 per share in 2021. Dividends in 2021 included a special
dividend of $10.00 per share, aggregating approximately $4,430. In April 2022, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from
$0.79 to $0.90 per share.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At August 28, 2022, we had borrowing capacity under
these facilities of $1,257. Our international operations maintain $773 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $176 is guaranteed by
the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities were $88 and $41 at the end of 2022 and 2021.
The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $224. The outstanding commitments under these
facilities at the end of 2022 totaled $184, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year.
The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these
29
Table of Contents
facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial
letters of credit outstanding.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or
future effect on our financial condition or financial statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires
that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these
estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Report.
Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities
Claims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle
liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks
to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses. We use different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive
insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are
estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are
highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims. While
we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs
could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.
Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)
Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in
speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various
instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as
well as short-term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date
of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our
short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations.
30
Table of Contents
Our policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by
U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank
balances. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government
and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market
funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.
A 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2022 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For
those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest
rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.
The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end
of 2022, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,590. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See
Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.
Foreign Currency Risk
Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We
manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these
fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to
economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate risk
with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's
forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. A hypothetical
10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2022, would have
decreased the fair value of the contracts by $128 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same
amount.
Commodity Price Risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and
manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities,
predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition
to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally
qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Costco Wholesale Corporation:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each
of the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated
financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended
August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 4, 2022,
expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Evaluation of workers' compensation self-insurance liabilities
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering
historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated self-insurance
liabilities as of August 28, 2022, were $1,364 million, a portion of which related to workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the
United States operations.
We identified the evaluation of the Company’s workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations as a
critical audit matter because of the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed to evaluate the underlying assumptions and
judgments made by the Company in the actuarial models. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the
Company's selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the actuarial models.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the
operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance workers' compensation process. This included
controls related to the development and selection of the assumptions listed above used in the actuarial calculation and review of the
actuarial report. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:
• Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards
• Evaluating the Company’s ability to estimate self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities by comparing its historical
estimates with actual incurred losses and paid losses
• Evaluating the above listed assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates by developing an independent
expectation of the self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities and comparing them to the amounts recorded by the
Company

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Costco Wholesale Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2022, based
on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2022,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
equity, and cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, and the related notes
(collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated October 4, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses
based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of
merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At August 28, 2022, Costco operated 838 warehouses
worldwide: 578 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 31 in Japan,
29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 17 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 13 in Australia, four in Spain, two each in France and China, and one in Iceland. The
Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a
controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the
Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been
eliminated in consolidation. During 2022, the Company paid a cash dividend of $208 and purchased the equity interest of its Taiwan operations
from its former joint-venture partner for $842, totaling $1,050 in the aggregate. The remaining noncontrolling interest represents the portion of
equity interests in a consolidated joint venture that is not 100% owned by the Company. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate
to net income attributable to Costco.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2022, 2021,
and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and
assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from
those estimates and assumptions.
Reclassification
Reclassifications were made to our 2021 and 2020 consolidated statements of income and cash flows to conform with current year presentation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at
the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card
receivables were $2,010 and $1,816 at the end of 2022 and 2021.
41
Table of Contents
The Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as payments are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end
of 2022 and 2021, are $995 and $999 representing the excess of outstanding payments over cash on deposit at the banks on which the
payments were drawn.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with maturities at the date of purchase of
three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-
term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term
investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and
losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale
securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated
statements of income. These available-for-sale investments have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S.
Government and Agencies. Changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Short-term
investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are
reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for credit impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative
criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be impaired as the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and
other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See
Notes 2, 3, and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of
observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are:
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market
data.
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as
quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all
other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety
of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves
including but not limited to treasury benchmarks and LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate and swap curves, discount rates, and market
data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports
transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair
42
Table of Contents
value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.
Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term
debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs,
and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based
primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit.
Receivables, Net
Receivables consist primarily of vendor, credit card incentive, reinsurance, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables
include discounts and volume rebates. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain
circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a
net basis. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under the co-branded credit card arrangements in the U.S. and
Canada. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amounts ceded
through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables
primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.
The valuation allowance related to receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of 2022, 2021, and 2020.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories consist of the following:
2022 2021
United States $ 13,160 $ 10,248 
Canada 1,966 1,456 
Other International 2,781 2,511 
Merchandise inventories $ 17,907 $ 14,215 
Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting,
using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely
matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of
inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and
inventory levels have been determined. Due to inflation, a $438 charge was recorded during 2022 to merchandise costs to increase the
cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories at August 28, 2022. An immaterial LIFO charge was recorded in 2021. Canadian and
Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) basis.
The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience. The provision is
adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where
appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided
that they are probable and reasonably estimable.
43
Table of Contents
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed primarily using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold
improvements are made.
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. During development,
these costs are included in construction in progress. To the extent that the assets become ready for their intended use, these costs are included
in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. In 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized in
SG&A expenses write-offs of $118 and $84 for certain information technology assets.
Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or
change asset function or useful life are capitalized. Assets removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired. Assets
classified as held-for-sale at the end of 2022 and 2021 were immaterial.
The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances at the end of 2022 and 2021:
Estimated Useful Lives 2022 2021
Land N/A $ 7,955 $ 7,507

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in
circumstances may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset
groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying
value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and
used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale
(disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by
obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charges recognized in 2022
or 2020. Impairment charges recognized in 2021 were immaterial.
Leases
The Company leases land, buildings, and/or equipment at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally
contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined
number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market
value; or (c) a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer.
44
Table of Contents
Some leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease
and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain
leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do
not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
The Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components and the lease components to which
they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU)
assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The
lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will
exercise the option. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments
is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the
Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted
interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as
described in Property and Equipment, net above.
The Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must be removed at the end of a lease.
These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term, based upon the
estimated fair value of the costs to remove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the
obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and are included with
buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Table of Contents
Definite-lived intangible assets, which are not material, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.
Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities
Claims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle
liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks
to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive
insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the
Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and
other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from
these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2022 and 2021, these insurance liabilities were $1,364 and $1,257 in the aggregate,
respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based
on their nature.
The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses,
in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The
reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the
commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program are designed to limit a
participating members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated
balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains
its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity.
Derivatives
The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part,
through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known
future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory
expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts
do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to
engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding
contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liability position and the amount
needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial at the end of 2022.
There were no derivative instruments in a net liability position at the end of 2021. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward
foreign-exchange contracts were $1,242 and $1,331 at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of
unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2022 and 2021.
The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to
the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2022, 2021 and 2020.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail
and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other
facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in
addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of
46
Table of Contents
derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no
mark-to-market adjustment.
Foreign Currency
The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are their local currencies. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign
currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss. Revenues and expenses of the Company’s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates
prevailing during the year.
The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their
functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These
items were $84 in 2022 and immaterial in 2021 and 2020.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where
applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated
returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a
gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the
consolidated balance sheets.
The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods. The Company
also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise
sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the
member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and
included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member
picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it
has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily
responsible for merchandising decisions, pricing discretion, and maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member
service and satisfaction.
The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period.
Deferred membership fees at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $2,174 and $2,042, respectively.
In most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value,
which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the
estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated
balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2022, 2021, and 2020, the net reduction in sales
was $2,307, $2,047, and $1,707 respectively.
47
Table of Contents
The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for
merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on
redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding shop card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Shop card
liabilities are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
Citibank, N.A. became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various forms of
consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the
rebate that cardholders receive, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are
issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other
International subsidiaries.
Merchandise Costs
Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs
related to the Company’s depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced
by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary
departments.
Vendor Consideration
The Company has agreements to receive funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by
signed agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the
rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a
reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’ compensation costs for warehouse employees
(other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home
office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment
depreciation, stock compensation expense, credit and debit card processing fees, utilities, preopening, as well as other operating costs incurred
to support warehouse and e-commerce website operations.
Retirement Plans
The Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The
plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each
eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in Canada and
contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit
and defined contribution plans, which are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $824, $748, and $676 for 2022, 2021, and 2020,
and are predominantly included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
Stock-Based Compensation
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of
stock-based awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Actual
forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
48
Table of Contents
Compensation expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for
the entire award. Awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting based on cumulative years of service with
the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative
amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at
that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the
expected dividends forgone during the vesting period.
Stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Certain stock-
based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information on the Company’s stock-
based compensation plans.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation
allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.
The timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment.
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-
than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the
Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate.
Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco
The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The
computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the
number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock
method for shares subject to RSUs.
Stock Repurchase Programs
Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased
shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital
and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding
and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional
information.

value adjustments to nonfinancial assets during 2022 and in 2021 they were immaterial.
Note 4—Debt
Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,257 and $1,050, in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Borrowings on these short-term facilities were immaterial during 2022 and 2021. Short-term borrowings outstanding were $88 and $41 at the
end of 2022 and 2021.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. On December 1, 2021, the Company repaid, prior to
maturity, the 2.300% Senior Notes at a redemption price plus accrued interest as specified in the Notes' agreement.
The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The
redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of
principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, the holder has the right to require the Company to purchase this security at a
price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the event. Interest on all outstanding long-term debt is
payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs.(1)

Dividends
Cash dividends declared in 2022 totaled $3.38 per share, as compared to $12.98 per share in 2021. Dividends in 2021 included a special
dividend of $10.00 per share, aggregating approximately $4,430. The Company's current quarterly dividend rate is $0.90 per share.
Stock Repurchase Programs
The Company's stock repurchase program is conducted under a $4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in April 2023. As
of the end of 2022, the remaining amount available under the approved plan was $2,808. The following table summarizes the Company’s stock
repurchase activity:

These amounts may differ from repurchases of common stock in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock
repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block
purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1.
Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants stock-based compensation, primarily to employees and non-employee directors. Grants to executive officers are generally
performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented
by the Company. RSUs are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of
service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized
the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant
and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The
Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually,
net of shares withheld for taxes.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
RSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five and three years, respectively. Additionally, the terms of the
RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 or
more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and
undelivered shares. At the end of 2022, 10,445,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the 2019 Incentive Plan.

Table of Contents
The following awards were outstanding at the end of 2022:
•3,328,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
•121,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 82,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2022. This determination occurred in September 2022, at which time at least 33% of the units vested, as a result
of the long service of all executive officers receiving performance-based RSUs. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment
over specified periods of time.

The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2022 and 2021 include deferred income tax assets of $445 and $444, respectively, included in other
long-term assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $724 and $754, respectively, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2022 and 2021, the Company had valuation allowances of $313 and $214, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carry forwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries after 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested
(other than China and Taiwan) and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and
state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The Company continues to consider undistributed earnings of
certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $2,779, to be indefinitely reinvested and has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2022 and 2021 is as follows:
2022 2021
Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 33 $ 30 
Gross increases—current year tax positions 1 2 
Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 12 2 
Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years (12) — 
Gross decreases—settlements (12) — 
Lapse of statute of limitations (6) (1)
Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 16 $ 33 
58
Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2022 and 2021, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $15 and $30 at the end of 2022 and 2021.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2022 and 2021, and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance
with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss
contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of amounts accrued. The Company
monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification
arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company
has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not
described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but
will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case,
there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual
has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably
estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual
theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.
The Company is a defendant in an action commenced in July 2013 under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA)
alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California
warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under
the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the
complaint. A bench trial was held in June and July; no decision has been issued.
In June 2022, a business center employee raised similar claims alleging failure to provide seating to employees who work at membership refund
desks in California warehouses and business centers. Rodriguez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22CV012847; Alameda Superior Court).
The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company filed an answer denying
the material allegations of the complaint.
In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees in California did not receive suitable seating or
reasonably comfortable workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. CIVDS 1908816; San Bernardino
Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In October 2019, the parties settled for an
immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in
60
Table of Contents
February 2020. The parties settled the temperature claims for an immaterial amount in April 2022, and court approval was received in May 2022.
In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide
meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair
business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale
Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019,
the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the
court remanded the action to state court. Settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon in February 2021. Final court approval of the
settlement was granted on May 3, 2022. A proposed intervenor has appealed the denial of her motion to intervene.
In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide
itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough
v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and
attorneys' fees. In September 2021, the court granted Costco’s motion for partial summary judgment and denied class certification. In August
2019, the plaintiff filed a companion case in state court seeking penalties under PAGA. Rough v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No.
FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The
state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action.
In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees
under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked, failure to pay certain non-exempt employees
on a weekly basis, and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserted individual retaliation claims. Cappadora
v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 1:20-cv-06067; E.D.N.Y.). An amended complaint was filed, and the Company denied the material
allegations of the amended complaint. Based on an agreement in principle concerning settlement of the matter, involving a proposed payment by
the Company of an immaterial amount, the federal action has been dismissed. In April 2022, Cappadora and a second plaintiff filed an action
against the Company in New York state court asserting the same class claims asserted in the federal action under the New York Labor Law and
seeking preliminary approval of the class settlement. Cappadora and Sancho v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Index No. 604757/2022; Nassau
County Supreme Court).
In August 2021, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting class claims on behalf of certain non-exempt employees under New York Labor
Law for failure to pay on a weekly basis. Umadat v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:21-cv-4814; E.D.N.Y.). The Company answered the
complaint on October 21, 2021, denying the material allegations. In April 2022, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting class claims on
behalf of certain non-exempt employees under New York Labor Law, as well as under the Fair Labor Standards Act, for failure to pay on a
weekly basis and failure to pay overtime. Burian v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:22-cv-02108; E.D.N.Y.).
In February 2021, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of California Labor Code regarding payment of
wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, payment of final wages to terminated employees, and for unfair
business practices. Edwards v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 5:21-cv-00716: C.D. Cal.). In May 2021, the Company filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint, which was granted with leave to amend. In June 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which the Company
moved to dismiss later that month. The court granted the motion in part in July 2021 with leave to amend. In August 2021, the plaintiff filed a
second amended complaint and filed a separate representative action under PAGA asserting the same Labor Code claims and seeking civil
penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company filed an answer to the second
61
Table of Contents
amended class action complaint, denying the material allegations. The Company also filed an answer to the PAGA representative action,
denying the material allegations.
In July 2021, a former temporary staffing employee filed a class action against the Company and a staffing company alleging violations of the
California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, the timeliness of wages and final wages, and for
unfair business practices. Dimas v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. STK-CV-UOE-2021-0006024; San Joaquin Superior Court). The
Company has moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims and to dismiss the class action complaint. On September 7, 2021,
the same former employee filed a separate representative action under PAGA asserting the same Labor Code violations and seeking civil
penalties and attorneys' fees. The case has been stayed pending the motion to compel in the related case.
In September 2021, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding the alleged
failure to provide sick pay, failure to timely pay wages due at separation from employment, and for violations of California's unfair competition
law. De Benning v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 34-2021-00309030-CU-OE-GDS; Sacramento Superior Court). The Company answered

court approval.
In March 2022, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding the failure to:
pay wages, provide meal and rest periods, provide accurate wage statements, timely pay final wages, and reimburse business expenses. Diaz v.
Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22STCV09513; Los Angeles Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations.
In May 2022, an employee filed a PAGA-only representative action against the Company alleging claims under the California Labor Code
regarding the payment of wages, meal and rest periods, the timeliness of wages and final wages, wage statements, accurate records and
business expenses. Gonzalez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22AHCV00255; Los Angeles Superior Court).
Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of
opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National
Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and
cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on
behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals
seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the
Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending
matters.
Members of the Board of Directors, six corporate officers and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to chicken
welfare and alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. Smith, et ano. v. Vachris, et al., Superior Court of the State of Washington, County of King, No,
22-2-08937-7SEA, (filed 6/14/22, as amended, 6/30/22); The complaint seeks from the individual defendants damages, injunctive relief, costs,
and attorneys' fees. A motion to dismiss the amended complaint has been filed.
The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the
matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Spain, France, China, and Iceland. Reportable segments are largely based on management’s
organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic
locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been
eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Effective for fiscal 2022, stock-based compensation was allocated to the segments
in this reporting. This change reflected a decision to evaluate the financial performance of the segments inclusive of this expense. Operating
income was restated in each of the segments for all prior periods to reflect this change.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that information required
to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely
decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management,
have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 28, 2022, and, based on their evaluation, have
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies
and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the
dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of August 28, 2022, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 28, 2022. The
attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is
included with the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that
occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

ARTICLES OF AMENDMENT AND REST ATEMENT
OF THE
ARTICLES OF INCORPORA TION
OF
COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORA TION
ARTICLE I
The name of this corporation is:
COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION
ARTICLE II
2.1    Classes. The total number of shares of all classes of stock which this corporation shall have authority to issue is one billion
(1,000,000,000), consisting of:
(a)    Nine hundred million (900,000,000) shares of common stock, the par value of each of which is $0.01 (the
“Common Stock”).
(b)    One hundred million (100,000,000) shares of preferred stock, the par value of each of which is $0.01 (the
“Preferred Stock”).
2.2    Preferred Stock. The preferences, limitations and relative rights of the Preferred Stock are undesignated. The board of directors is
authorized to designate one or more series within the Preferred Stock, and the designation and number of shares within each series, and shall
determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of any shares of Preferred Stock, or of any series of Preferred Stock, before issuance
of any shares of that class or series. The board of directors is authorized to amend these Articles as provided in RCW 23B.06.020 to effect the
designation of rights of any series of Preferred Stock.
ARTICLE III
3.1    No Preemptive Rights. The shareholders of this corporation have no preemptive rights to acquire additional shares of this
corporation.
3.2    No Cumulative Voting. The right to cumulate votes in the election of directors shall not exist with respect to shares of stock of this
corporation.
3.3    Special Meetings of Shareholders. The shareholders of this corporation shall have no right to call a special meeting of the
shareholders of this corporation for any purpose or purposes and special meetings of shareholders of this corporation may only be called by a
majority of the board of directors or the Chairman, the President, any Executive Vice President or the Secretary of this corporation of
shareholders owning aggregate at least 10% of all votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed special
meeting.
ARTICLE IV
The number of directors which shall constitute the whole board of directors of this corporation shall be fixed by, or in the manner
provided in the bylaws of this corporation, as the same may be amended from time to time.
ARTICLE V
The board of directors shall be divided into three classes: Class I, Class II, and Class III. Such classes shall be as nearly equal in
number of directors as possible. Each director shall serve for a term ending at the third annual shareholders’ meeting following the annual
meeting at which such director was elected. The directors, the class to which they are elected, and the year in which their term expires, are as
follows:
Director  Class  Year in Which Term Expires
James D. Sinegal  I  2000
Jeffrey H. Brotman  I  2000
Richard A. Galanti  I  2000
Hamilton E. James  II  2001
Frederick O. Paulsell, Jr.  II  2001
Jill S. Ruckelshaus  II  2001
Benjamin S. Carson  II  2001
Richard M. Libenson  III  2002
John W. Meisenbach  III  2002
Charles T. Munger  III  2002
Richard D. DiCerchio  III  2002
At each annual election, the directors chosen to succeed those whose terms then expire shall be identified as being of the same class
as the directors they succeed, unless, by reason of any intervening changes in the authorized number of directors, the board of directors shall
designate one or more directorships whose terms then expire as directorships of another class in order more nearly to achieve equality in the
number of directors among the classes. When the board of directors fills a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a director,
the director chosen to fill that vacancy shall be of the same class as the director he succeeds.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of Article V, in all cases, including upon any change in the authorized number of
directors, each director then continuing to serve as such will nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he is a member, until the
expiration of his current term or his earlier death, resignation or removal. Any vacancy to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of
directors may be filled by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article V to the contrary, the classification of directors as provide in this Article V may be
altered or eliminated only by an amendment to this Article approved by two-third of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group entitled to
vote on such amendment.
ARTICLE VI
A director of this corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for conduct as a
director, except for liability of the director (i) for acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct by the director or a knowing violation of law
by the director, (ii) for conduct violating RCW 23B.08.310 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, or (iii) for any transaction from which the
director will personally receive a benefit in money, property or services to which the director is not legally entitled. If the Washington Business
Corporation Act is amended in the future to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of this corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the full extent permitted by the Washington Business Corporation Act, as
so amended, without any requirement of further action by the shareholders.
ARTICLE VII
The corporation shall indemnify any individual made a party to a proceeding because that individual is or was a director of the
corporation and shall advance or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by such individual in advance of final disposition of the
proceeding, without regard to the limitations in RCW 23B.08.510 through 23B.08.550 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, or any other
limitation which may hereafter be enacted to the extent such limitation may be disregarded if authorized by the Articles of Incorporation, to the
full extent and under all circumstances permitted by applicable law.
Any repeal or modification of this Article by the shareholders of this corporation shall not adversely affect any right of any individual who
is or was a director of the corporation which existed at the time of such repeal or modification.
ARTICLE VIII
Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any director, or the entire board of directors, may be
removed from office only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of all shares of this corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors. As used herein, “for cause" means either
(i) conviction of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction and such conviction is no longer subject to direct appeal or (ii) adjudication for gross
negligence or dishonest conduct in the performance of a director's duty to this corporation by a court of competent jurisdiction and such
adjudication is no longer subject to direct appeal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Article may be altered or eliminated only by
amendment to this Article approved by two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group entitled to vote on such amendment.
 
ARTICLE IX
Amendment of the articles of incorporation, approval of a plan of merger or share exchange, authorization of the sale, lease, exchange
or other disposition of all, or substantially all of the corporation’s property, otherwise than in the usual and regular course of business, and
authorization of the dissolution of the corporation, shall be approved by each voting group entitled to vote thereon by a simple majority of all the
votes entitled to be cast by that voting group.

Exhibit 4.8
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
The following description of the Company’s common stock is based upon the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as amended (“Articles”), the
Company’s Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), and applicable provisions of law. We have summarized certain portions of our Articles and Bylaws
below. This summary is not complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by express reference to, the provisions of our Articles and
Bylaws, each of which is filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.8 is a part.
Our authorized capital stock consists of 900,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.005 par value per share, and 100,000,000 shares of
undesignated preferred stock, $0.005 par value per share.
Common Stock
Dividend Rights. Subject to the prior or preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock outstanding at the time, holders of our common stock
are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors out of legally available funds.
Voting Rights. Each share of our common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters voted on by the shareholders, including the
election of directors. We have not provided for cumulative voting for the election of directors in our Articles.
Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions. Subject to the prior or preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock outstanding at the time,
in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally
available for distribution to shareholders.
Rights and Preferences. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund
provisions applicable to our common stock.
Preferred Stock
Our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one
or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions thereof. These rights, preferences, and privileges could include
dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences, sinking fund terms, and the number of shares
constituting any series or the designation of such series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of common stock. The issuance of
preferred stock by us could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive
dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock by us could have the effect of delaying, deferring,
or preventing a change in control of our company or other corporate action. No shares of preferred stock are outstanding, and we have no
present plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.
 
Anti-Takeover Provisions
Washington Anti-Takeover Law
Washington law imposes restrictions on some transactions between a corporation and significant shareholders. Chapter 23B.19 of the
Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in specified “significant business transactions” with
an “acquiring person.” This statute could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with
respect to us and, accordingly, may discourage unsolicited attempts to acquire us. An “acquiring person” is generally defined as a person or
group of persons that beneficially owns the voting shares entitled to cast votes comprising 10% or more of the voting power of the target
corporation. The target corporation may not engage in “significant business transactions,” as defined in Chapter 23B.19, for a period of five years
after the date of the transaction in which the person became an acquiring person, unless (1) the significant business transaction or the acquiring
person’s purchase of shares was approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation’s board of directors prior to the share
acquisition causing the person to become an “acquiring person,” or (2) the significant business transaction was both approved by the majority of
the members of the target corporation’s board and authorized at a shareholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by
the outstanding voting shares (excluding the acquiring person’s shares or shares over which the acquiring person has voting control) at or
subsequent to the acquiring person’s share acquisition. “Significant business transactions” include, among other things:
•a merger or share exchange with, disposition of assets to, or issuance or redemption of stock to or from, the acquiring person;
•a termination of 5% or more of the employees of the target corporation employed in the State of Washington as a result of the
acquiring person’s acquisition of 10% or more of the shares, whether at one time or over the five-year period following the share
acquisition;
•a transaction in which the acquiring person is allowed to receive a disproportionate benefit as a shareholder; or
•liquidating or dissolving the target corporation.
After the five-year period, a “significant business transaction” may occur, as long as it complies with “fair price” provisions specified in the statute
or is approved at a meeting of shareholders by a majority of the votes entitled to be counted within each voting group entitled to vote separately
on the transaction, not counting the votes of shares as to which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership or voting control. A corporation
may not “opt out” of this statute.
Articles of Incorporation, as Amended and Bylaws, as Amended
Our Articles and Bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of deterring takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in
control or changes in our management that a shareholder might deem to be in the shareholder’s best interest. These provisions include the
following:
•our Board of Directors may issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights or preferences as it may designate;
- 2 -
•our Articles and Bylaws provide that (1) until the declassification of our Board of Directors implemented by amendments to our
Articles and Bylaws that became effective in January 2019 is fully phased in beginning with our 2022 annual meeting of
shareholders, the current three-year terms of certain of our directors will remain in effect until their current terms expire, and
(2) only our Board of Directors may change the size of our Board of Directors, which provisions together generally make it more
difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our Board of Directors;
•Washington law, our Articles and Bylaws limit the ability of shareholders from acting by written consent by requiring unanimous
written consent for shareholder action to be effective;
•our Articles and Bylaws limit who may call a special meeting of shareholders to only our Board of Directors, Chairman, President,
any Executive Vice President or the Secretary or shareholders owning an aggregate at least 10% of all votes entitled to be cast;
•our Bylaws provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates
for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide timely advance written notice to us in writing, and specify
requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder’s notice, which may preclude shareholders from bringing matters before
a meeting of shareholders or from making nominations for directors at a meeting of shareholders; and
•our Articles do not provide for cumulative voting for our directors, which may make it more difficult for shareholders owning less
than a majority of our capital stock to elect any members to our Board of Directors.
